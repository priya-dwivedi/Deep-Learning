# Recurrent Neural Networks course project: time series prediction and text generation

## Accelerating the Training Process 

If your code is taking too long to run, you will need to either reduce the complexity of your chosen RNN architecture or switch to running your code on a GPU.  If you'd like to use a GPU, you have two options:

#### Build your Own Deep Learning Workstation

If you have access to a GPU, you should follow the Keras instructions for [running Keras on GPU](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-run-keras-on-gpu).

#### Amazon Web Services

Instead of a local GPU, you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money.)
