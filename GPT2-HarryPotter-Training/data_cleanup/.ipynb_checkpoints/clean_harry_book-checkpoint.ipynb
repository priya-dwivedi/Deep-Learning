       "'\\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive,\\nwere proud to say that they were perfectly normal,\\nthank you very much. They were the last people you’d\\nexpect to be involved in anything strange or\\nmysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such\\nnonsense.\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called\\nGrunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy\\nman with hardly any neck, although he did have a\\nvery large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and\\nblonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of\\nneck, which came in very useful as she spent so\\nmuch of her time craning over garden fences, spying\\non the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son\\ncalled Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer\\nboy anywhere.\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they\\nalso had a secret, and their greatest fear was that\\nsomebody would discover it. They didn’t think they\\ncould bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.\\nMrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t\\n \\nmet for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended\\nshe didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her\\ngood-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it\\nwas possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think\\nwhat the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in\\nthe street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a\\nsmall son, too, but they had never even seen him.\\nThis boy was another good reason for keeping the\\nPotters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a\\nchild like that.\\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray\\nTuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the\\ncloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\\nmysterious things would soon be happening all over\\nthe country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out\\nhis most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\\ngossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\\nDudley into his high chair.\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past\\nthe window.\\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his\\nbriefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and\\ntried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because\\nDudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his\\ncereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley\\nas he left the house. He got into his car and backed\\nout of number four’s drive.\\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the\\nfirst sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a\\nmap. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he\\nhad seen — then he jerked his head around to look\\nagain. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner\\nof Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What\\ncould he have been thinking of? It must have been a\\ntrick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at\\n \\nthe cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around\\nthe corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his\\nmirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet\\nDrive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read\\nmaps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake\\nand put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward\\ntown he thought of nothing except a large order of\\ndrills he was hoping to get that day.\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his\\nmind by something else. As he sat in the usual\\nmorning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that\\nthere seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear\\npeople who dressed in funny clothes — the getups\\nyou saw on young people! He supposed this was some\\nstupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the\\nsteering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\\nweirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering\\nexcitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see\\nthat a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that\\nman had to be older than he was, and wearing an\\nemerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it\\nstruck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\\nstunt — these people were obviously collecting for\\nsomething ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved\\non and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\\nGrunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in\\nhis office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might\\nhave found it harder to concentrate on drills that\\nmorning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in\\nbroad daylight, though people down in the street did;\\nthey pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\\nowl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an\\nowl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a\\nperfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\\ndifferent people. He made several important telephone\\n \\ncalls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good\\nmood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch\\nhis legs and walk across the road to buy himself a\\nbun from the bakery.\\nHe’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he\\npassed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed\\nthem angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but\\nthey made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering\\nexcitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting\\ntin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a\\nlarge doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words\\nof what they were saying.\\n“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ”\\n“ — yes, their son, Harry — ”\\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He\\nlooked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say\\nsomething to them, but thought better of it.\\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his\\noffice, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him,\\nseized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing\\nhis home number when he changed his mind. He put\\nthe receiver back down and stroked his mustache,\\nthinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t\\nsuch an unusual name. He was sure there were lots\\nof people called Potter who had a son called Harry.\\nCome to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew\\nwas called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It\\nmight have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no\\npoint in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so\\nupset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame\\nher — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the\\nsame, those people in cloaks ...\\n \\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that\\nafternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock,\\nhe was still so worried that he walked straight into\\nsomeone just outside the door.\\n“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled\\nand almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr.\\nDursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\\ncloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost\\nknocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split\\ninto a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that\\nmade passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir,\\nfor nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-\\nKnow-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like\\nyourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy\\nday!”\\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the\\nmiddle and walked off.\\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been\\nhugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he\\nhad been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was\\nrattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home,\\nhoping he was imagining things, which he had never\\nhoped before, because he didn’t approve of\\nimagination.\\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the\\nfirst thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood —\\nwas the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was\\nnow sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the\\nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\\n“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.\\nThe cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look.\\nWas this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered.\\nTrying to pull himself together, he let himself into the\\n \\nhouse. He was still determined not to mention\\nanything to his wife.\\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told\\nhim over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems\\nwith her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new\\nword (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.\\nWhen Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the\\nliving room in time to catch the last report on the\\nevening news:\\n“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported\\nthat the nation’s owls have been behaving very\\nunusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\\nnight and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have\\nbeen hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in\\nevery direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\\nexplain why the owls have suddenly changed their\\nsleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a\\ngrin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\\nMcGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more\\nshowers of owls tonight, Jim?”\\n“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about\\nthat, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting\\noddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire,\\nand Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that\\ninstead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a\\ndownpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have\\nbeen celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until\\nnext week, folks! But I can promise a wet night\\ntonight.”\\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars\\nall over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious\\npeople in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a\\nwhisper about the Potters . . .\\n \\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two\\ncups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say\\nsomething to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er\\n— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister\\nlately, have you?”\\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and\\nangry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t\\nhave a sister.\\n“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”\\n“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled.\\n“Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of\\nfunny-looking people in town today ...”\\n“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.\\n“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to\\ndo with ... you know ... her crowd.”\\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr.\\nDursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d\\nheard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare.\\nInstead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son —\\nhe’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”\\n“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\\n“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”\\n“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”\\n“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking\\nhorribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”\\nHe didn’t say another word on the subject as they\\nwent upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the\\nbathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window\\n \\nand peered down into the front garden. The cat was\\nstill there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though\\nit were waiting for something.\\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have\\nanything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out\\nthat they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t\\nthink he could bear it.\\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep\\nquickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over\\nin his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell\\nasleep was that even if the Potters were involved,\\nthere was no reason for them to come near him and\\nMrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and\\nPetunia thought about them and their kind. ... He\\ncouldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up\\nin anything that might be going on — he yawned and\\nturned over — it couldn’t affect them. ...\\nHow very wrong he was.\\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy\\nsleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no\\nsign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue,\\nits eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet\\nDrive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door\\nslammed on the next street, nor when two owls\\nswooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight\\nbefore the cat moved at all.\\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been\\nwatching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d\\nhave thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The\\ncat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet\\nDrive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the\\nsilver of his hair and beard, which were both long\\n \\nenough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long\\nrobes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and\\nhigh-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\\nbright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles\\nand his nose was very long and crooked, as though it\\nhad been broken at least twice. This man’s name was\\nAlbus Dumbledore.\\nAlbus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had\\njust arrived in a street where everything from his\\nname to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy\\nrummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But\\nhe did seem to realize he was being watched, because\\nhe looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\\nstaring at him from the other end of the street. For\\nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse\\nhim. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have\\nknown.”\\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside\\npocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He\\nflicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.\\nThe nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He\\nclicked it again — the next lamp flickered into\\ndarkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,\\nuntil the only lights left on the whole street were two\\ntiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of\\nthe cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their\\nwindow now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they\\nwouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening\\ndown on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-\\nOuter back inside his cloak and set off down the\\nstreet toward number four, where he sat down on the\\nwall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a\\nmoment he spoke to it.\\n“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”\\n \\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.\\nInstead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking\\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its\\neyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.\\nHer black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She\\nlooked distinctly ruffled.\\n“How did you know it was me?” she asked.\\n“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”\\n“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all\\nday,” said Professor McGonagall.\\n“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I\\nmust have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my\\nway here.”\\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\\n“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said\\nimpatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful,\\nbut no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s\\ngoing on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head\\nback at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I\\nheard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well,\\nthey’re not completely stupid. They were bound to\\nnotice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll\\nbet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much\\nsense.”\\n“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently.\\n“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven\\nyears.”\\n“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.\\n“But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are\\nbeing downright careless, out on the streets in broad\\n \\ndaylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,\\nswapping rumors.”\\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore\\nhere, as though hoping he was going to tell her\\nsomething, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine\\nthing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who\\nseems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found\\nout about us all. I suppose he really has gone,\\nDumbledore?”\\n“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have\\nmuch to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon\\ndrop?”\\n“A what?”\\n“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m\\nrather fond of.”\\n“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as\\nthough she didn’t think this was the moment for\\nlemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has\\ngone — ”\\n“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like\\nyourself can call him by his name? All this You-\\nKnow-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been\\ntrying to persuade people to call him by his proper\\nname: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but\\nDumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,\\nseemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we\\nkeep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any\\nreason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.”\\n“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall,\\nsounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re\\ndifferent. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-\\nKnow- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”\\n \\n“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort\\nhad powers I will never have.”\\n“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use\\nthem.”\\n“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since\\nMadam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.”\\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at\\nDumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to\\nthe rumors that are flying around. You know what\\neveryone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared?\\nAbout what finally stopped him?”\\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the\\npoint she was most anxious to discuss, the real\\nreason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all\\nday, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she\\nfixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she\\ndid now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was\\nsaying, she was not going to believe it until\\nDumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore,\\nhowever, was choosing another lemon drop and did\\nnot answer.\\n“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last\\nnight Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He\\nwent to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and\\nJames Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.”\\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall\\ngasped.\\n“Lily and James ... I can’t believe it ... I didn’t want to\\nbelieve it ... Oh, Albus ...”\\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the\\nshoulder. “I know ... I know ...” he said heavily.\\n \\nProfessor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went\\non. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the\\nPotters’ son, Harry. But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t\\nkill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but\\nthey’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter,\\nVoldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why\\nhe’s gone.”\\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\\n“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After\\nall he’s done ... all the people he’s killed ... he couldn’t\\nkill a little boy? It’s just astounding ... of all the\\nthings to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven\\ndid Harry survive?”\\n“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may\\nnever know.”\\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief\\nand dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.\\nDumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden\\nwatch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very\\nodd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers;\\ninstead, little planets were moving around the edge. It\\nmust have made sense to Dumbledore, though,\\nbecause he put it back in his pocket and said,\\n“Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be\\nhere, by the way?”\\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t\\nsuppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all\\nplaces?”\\n“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.\\nThey’re the only family he has left now.”\\n“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who\\nlive here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her\\n \\nfeet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you\\ncan’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t\\nfind two people who are less like us. And they’ve got\\nthis son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way\\nup the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter\\ncome and live here!”\\n“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly.\\n“His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything\\nto him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.”\\n“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly,\\nsitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore,\\nyou think you can explain all this in a letter? These\\npeople will never understand him! He’ll be famous —\\na legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was\\nknown as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will\\nbe books written about Harry — every child in our\\nworld will know his name!”\\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously\\nover the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be\\nenough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can\\nwalk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even\\nremember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be,\\ngrowing up away from all that until he’s ready to take\\nit?”\\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her\\nmind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re\\nright, of course. But how is the boy getting here,\\nDumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though\\nshe thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\\n“Hagrid’s bringing him.”\\n“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with\\nsomething as important as this?”\\n \\n“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.\\n“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t\\npretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what\\nwas that?”\\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around\\nthem. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and\\ndown the street for some sign of a headlight; it\\nswelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky —\\nand a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed\\non the road in front of them.\\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man\\nsitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a\\nnormal man and at least five times as wide. He looked\\nsimply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long\\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his\\nface, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his\\nfeet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In\\nhis vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of\\nblankets.\\n“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At\\nlast. And where did you get that motorcycle?”\\n“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the\\ngiant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he\\nspoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him,\\nsir.”\\n“No problems, were there?”\\n“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him\\nout all right before the Muggles started swarmin’\\naround. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.”\\n \\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward\\nover the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a\\nbaby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair\\nover his forehead they could see a curiously shaped\\ncut, like a bolt of lightning.\\n“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Hell have that scar forever.”\\n“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”\\n“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy.\\nI have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect\\nmap of the London Underground. Well — give him\\nhere, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”\\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned\\ntoward the Dursleys’ house.\\n“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked\\nHagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry\\nand gave him what must have been a very scratchy,\\nwhiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl\\nlike a wounded dog.\\n“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the\\nMuggles!”\\n“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted\\nhandkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-\\ncan’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little\\nHarry off ter live with Muggles — ”\\n“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself,\\nHagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall\\nwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as\\nDumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and\\nwalked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the\\n \\ndoorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it\\ninside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the\\nother two. For a full minute the three of them stood\\nand looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders\\nshook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and\\nthe twinkling light that usually shone from\\nDumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.\\n“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no\\nbusiness staying here. We may as well go and join the\\ncelebrations.”\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best\\nget this bike away. G ’night, Professor McGonagall —\\nProfessor Dumbledore, sir.”\\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid\\nswung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the\\nengine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off\\ninto the night.\\n“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,”\\nsaid Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor\\nMcGonagall blew her nose in reply.\\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street.\\nOn the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-\\nOuter. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light\\nsped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive\\nglowed suddenly orange and he could make out a\\ntabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end\\nof the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets\\non the step of number four.\\n“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his\\nheel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which\\nlay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last\\n \\nplace you would expect astonishing things to happen.\\nHarry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without\\nwaking up. One small hand closed on the letter\\nbeside him and he slept on, not knowing he was\\nspecial, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he\\nwould be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs.\\nDursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put\\nout the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next\\nfew weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin\\nDudley. ... He couldn’t know that at this very\\nmoment, people meeting in secret all over the country\\nwere holding up their glasses and saying in hushed\\nvoices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”\\n \\nTHE VANASHIG GLASS\\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had\\nwoken up to find their nephew on the front step, but\\nPrivet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose\\non the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass\\nnumber four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into\\ntheir living room, which was almost exactly the same\\nas it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had\\nseen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the\\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how\\nmuch time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been\\nlots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach\\nball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley\\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the\\nphotographs showed a large blond boy riding his first\\nbicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer\\ngame with his father, being hugged and kissed by his\\nmother. The room held no sign at all that another boy\\nlived in the house, too.\\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment,\\nbut not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it\\n \\nwas her shrill voice that made the first noise of the\\nday.\\n“Up! Get up! Now!”\\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door\\nagain.\\n“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward\\nthe kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan\\nbeing put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and\\ntried to remember the dream he had been having. It\\nhad been a good one. There had been a flying\\nmotorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the\\nsame dream before.\\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\\n“Are you up yet?” she demanded.\\n“Nearly,” said Harry.\\n“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the\\nbacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want\\neverything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”\\nHarry groaned.\\n“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the\\ndoor.\\n“Nothing, nothing ...”\\nDudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten?\\nHarry got slowly out of bed and started looking for\\nsocks. He found a pair under his bed and, after\\npulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry\\nwas used to spiders, because the cupboard under the\\nstairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\\n \\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the\\nkitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all\\nDudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though\\nDudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not\\nto mention the second television and the racing bike.\\nExactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a\\nmystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated\\nexercise — unless of course it involved punching\\nsomebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry,\\nbut he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it,\\nbut he was very fast.\\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark\\ncupboard, but Harry had always been small and\\nskinny for his age. He looked even smaller and\\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to\\nwear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was\\nabout four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin\\nface, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green\\neyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot\\nof Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had\\npunched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked\\nabout his own appearance was a very thin scar on his\\nforehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He\\nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the\\nfirst question he could ever remember asking his\\nAunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\\n“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had\\nsaid. “And don’t ask questions.”\\nDon’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a\\nquiet life with the Dursleys.\\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was\\nturning over the bacon.\\n“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning\\ngreeting.\\n \\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top\\nof his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a\\nhaircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the\\nrest of the boys in his class put together, but it made\\nno difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over\\nthe place.\\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in\\nthe kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like\\nUncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much\\nneck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair\\nthat lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia\\noften said that Dudley looked like a baby angel —\\nHarry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a\\nwig.\\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table,\\nwhich was difficult as there wasn’t much room.\\nDudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His\\nface fell.\\n“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and\\nfather. “That’s two less than last year.”\\n“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present,\\nsee, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and\\nDaddy.”\\n“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red\\nin the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley\\ntantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as\\nfast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because\\nshe said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two\\npresents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin?\\nTwo more presents. Is that all right?”\\n \\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard\\nwork. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty ...\\nthirty ...”\\n“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.\\n“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the\\nnearest parcel. “All right then.”\\nUncle Vernon chuckled.\\n“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his\\nfather. ’Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair.\\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia\\nwent to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon\\nwatched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video\\ncamera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new\\ncomputer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the\\npaper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came\\nback from the telephone looking both angry and\\nworried.\\n“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her\\nleg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in\\nHarry’s direction.\\nDudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart\\ngave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his\\nparents took him and a friend out for the day, to\\nadventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the\\nmovies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs.\\nFigg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.\\nHarry hated it there. The whole house smelled of\\ncabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs\\nof all the cats she’d ever owned.\\n“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at\\nHarry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he\\n \\nought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg,\\nbut it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would\\nbe a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies,\\nSnowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\\n“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.\\n“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”\\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as\\nthough he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was\\nsomething very nasty that couldn’t understand them,\\nlike a slug.\\n“What about what’s-her-name, your friend —\\nYvonne?”\\n“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.\\n“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully\\n(he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television\\nfor a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s\\ncomputer) .\\nAunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a\\nlemon.\\n“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she\\nsnarled.\\n“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they\\nweren’t listening.\\n“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt\\nPetunia slowly, \"... and leave him in the car. ...”\\n“That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. ...”\\n \\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really\\ncrying — it had been years since he’d really cried —\\nbut he knew that if he screwed up his face and\\nwailed, his mother would give him anything he\\nwanted.\\n“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him\\nspoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms\\naround him.\\n“I ... don’t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!” Dudley\\nyelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-\\nspoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through\\nthe gap in his mothers arms.\\nJust then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord,\\nthey’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a\\nmoment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss,\\nwalked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy\\nwith a face like a rat. He was usually the one who\\nheld people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley\\nhit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his\\nluck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with\\nPiers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first\\ntime in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able\\nto think of anything else to do with him, but before\\nthey’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\\n“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large\\npurple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you\\nnow, boy — any funny business, anything at all —\\nand you’ll be in that cupboard from now until\\nChristmas.”\\nI’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly\\n \\nBut Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.\\nThe problem was, strange things often happened\\naround Harry and it was just no good telling the\\nDursleys he didn’t make them happen.\\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from\\nthe barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all,\\nhad taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair\\nso short he was almost bald except for his bangs,\\nwhich she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had\\nlaughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless\\nnight imagining school the next day, where he was\\nalready laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped\\nglasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to\\nfind his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt\\nPetunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week\\nin his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to\\nexplain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown\\nback so quickly.\\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force\\nhim into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown\\nwith orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it\\nover his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until\\nfinally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but\\ncertainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided\\nit must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great\\nrelief, Harry wasn’t punished.\\nOn the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble\\nfor being found on the roof of the school kitchens.\\nDudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when,\\nas much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he\\nwas sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had\\nreceived a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress\\ntelling them Harry had been climbing school\\nbuildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at\\nUncle Vernon through the locked door of his\\n \\ncupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans\\noutside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the\\nwind must have caught him in mid-jump.\\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even\\nworth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the\\nday somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or\\nMrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.\\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt\\nPetunia. He liked to complain about things: people at\\nwork, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry\\nwere just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,\\nit was motorcycles.\\n\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,”\\nhe said, as a motorcycle overtook them.\\n“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry,\\nremembering suddenly. “It was flying.”\\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He\\nturned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry,\\nhis face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:\\n“MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!”\\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\\n“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”\\nBut he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was\\none thing the Dursleys hated even more than his\\nasking questions, it was his talking about anything\\nacting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a\\ndream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he\\nmight get dangerous ideas.\\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was\\ncrowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley\\n \\nand Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance\\nand then, because the smiling lady in the van had\\nasked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry\\nhim away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It\\nwasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they\\nwatched a gorilla scratching its head who looked\\nremarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.\\nHarry had the best morning he’d had in a long time.\\nHe was careful to walk a little way apart from the\\nDursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting\\nto get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t\\nfall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They\\nate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a\\ntantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have\\nenough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him\\nanother one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it\\nwas all too good to last.\\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool\\nand dark in there, with lit windows all along the\\nwalls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes\\nwere crawling and slithering over bits of wood and\\nstone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge,\\npoisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.\\nDudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It\\ncould have wrapped its body twice around Uncle\\nVernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at\\nthe moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was\\nfast asleep.\\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass,\\nstaring at the glistening brown coils.\\n“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon\\ntapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.\\n \\n“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped\\nthe glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake\\njust snoozed on.\\n“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently\\nat the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it\\nhad died of boredom itself — no company except\\nstupid people drumming their fingers on the glass\\ntrying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than\\nhaving a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only\\nvisitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to\\nwake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the\\nhouse.\\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly,\\nvery slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a\\nlevel with Harry’s.\\nIt winked.\\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if\\nanyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back\\nat the snake and winked, too.\\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and\\nDudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave\\nHarry a look that said quite plainly:\\n“I get that all the time.”\\n“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though\\nhe wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be\\nreally annoying.”\\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\\n“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.\\n \\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the\\nglass. Harry peered at it.\\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\\n“Was it nice there?”\\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again\\nand Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the\\nzoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?”\\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout\\nbehind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY!\\nMR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE!\\nYOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”\\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he\\ncould.\\n“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the\\nribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the\\nconcrete floor. What came next happened so fast no\\none saw how it happened — one second, Piers and\\nDudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the\\nnext, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa\\nconstrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was\\nuncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor.\\nPeople throughout the reptile house screamed and\\nstarted running for the exits.\\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have\\nsworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.\\n... Thanksss, amigo.”\\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\\n \\n“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass\\ngo?” \"\\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of\\nstrong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over\\nagain. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as\\nHarry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything\\nexcept snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but\\nby the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car,\\nDudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off\\nhis leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to\\nsqueeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at\\nleast, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry\\nwas talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”\\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the\\nhouse before starting on Harry. He was so angry he\\ncould hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go —\\ncupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed\\ninto a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get\\nhim a large brandy.\\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing\\nhe had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and\\nhe couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.\\nUntil they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the\\nkitchen for some food.\\nHe’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten\\nmiserable years, as long as he could remember, ever\\nsince he’d been a baby and his parents had died in\\nthat car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car\\nwhen his parents had died. Sometimes, when he\\nstrained his memory during long hours in his\\ncupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a\\nblinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his\\nforehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though\\nhe couldn’t imagine where all the green light came\\nfrom. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His\\n \\naunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of\\ncourse he was forbidden to ask questions. There were\\nno photographs of them in the house.\\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and\\ndreamed of some unknown relation coming to take\\nhim away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys\\nwere his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or\\nmaybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to\\nknow him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A\\ntiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once\\nwhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley.\\nAfter asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt\\nPetunia had rushed them out of the shop without\\nbuying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed\\nall in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.\\nA bald man in a very long purple coat had actually\\nshaken his hand in the street the other day and then\\nwalked away without a word. The weirdest thing\\nabout all these people was the way they seemed to\\nvanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that\\nDudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his\\nbaggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody\\nliked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.\\n \\n3\\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned\\nHarry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he\\nwas allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer\\nholidays had started and Dudley had already broken\\nhis new video camera, crashed his remote control\\nairplane, and, first time out on his racing bike,\\nknocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet\\nDrive on her crutches.\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no\\nescaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every\\nsingle day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were\\nall big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and\\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of\\nthem were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite\\nsport: Harry Hunting.\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible\\nout of the house, wandering around and thinking\\nabout the end of the holidays, where he could see a\\ntiny ray of hope. When September came he would be\\ngoing off to secondary school and, for the first time in\\n \\nhis life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been\\naccepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school,\\nSmeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry,\\non the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the\\nlocal public school. Dudley thought this was very\\nfunny.\\n“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day\\nat Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs\\nand practice?”\\n“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had\\nanything as horrible as your head down it — it might\\nbe sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out\\nwhat he’d said.\\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London\\nto buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs.\\nFigg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out\\nshe’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and\\nshe didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She\\nlet Harry watch television and gave him a bit of\\nchocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for\\nseveral years.\\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room\\nfor the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings\\nboys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers,\\nand flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried\\nknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the\\nteachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be\\ngood training for later life.\\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers,\\nUncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest\\nmoment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and\\nsaid she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins,\\nhe looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t\\n \\ntrust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs\\nmight already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\\nk k k\\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next\\nmorning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed\\nto be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He\\nwent to have a look. The tub was full of what looked\\nlike dirty rags swimming in gray water.\\n“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips\\ntightened as they always did if he dared to ask a\\nquestion.\\n“Your new school uniform,” she said.\\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\\n“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”\\n“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing\\nsome of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just\\nlike everyone else’s when I’ve finished.”\\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not\\nto argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to\\nthink about how he was going to look on his first day\\nat Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old\\nelephant skin, probably.\\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with\\nwrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new\\nuniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\\nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which\\nhe carried everywhere, on the table.\\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters\\non the doormat.\\n \\n“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from\\nbehind his paper.\\n“Make Harry get it.”\\n“Get the mail, Harry.”\\n“Make Dudley get it.”\\n“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”\\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the\\nmail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard\\nfrom Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was\\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope\\nthat looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.\\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging\\nlike a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole\\nlife, had written to him. Who would? He had no\\nfriends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the\\nlibrary, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for\\nbooks back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so\\nplainly there could be no mistake:\\nMr. H. Potter\\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\\n4 Privet Drive\\nLittle Whinging\\nSurrey\\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish\\nparchment, and the address was written in emerald-\\ngreen ink. There was no stamp.\\n \\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry\\nsaw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion,\\nan eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large\\nletter H.\\n“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the\\nkitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter\\nbombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.\\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his\\nletter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the\\npostcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the\\nyellow envelope.\\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust,\\nand flipped over the postcard.\\n“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny\\nwhelk ...”\\n“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got\\nsomething!”\\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which\\nwas written on the same heavy parchment as the\\nenvelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand\\nby Uncle Vernon.\\n“That’s mine\\\\” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\\n“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon,\\nshaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at\\nit. His face went from red to green faster than a set of\\ntraffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds\\nit was the grayish white of old porridge.\\n“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.\\n \\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle\\nVernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia\\ntook it curiously and read the first line. For a moment\\nit looked as though she might faint. She clutched her\\nthroat and made a choking noise.\\n“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”\\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten\\nthat Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley\\nwasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a\\nsharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\\n“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.\\n“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”\\n“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing\\nthe letter back inside its envelope.\\nHarry didn’t move.\\n“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.\\n“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.\\n“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry\\nand Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw\\nthem into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind\\nthem. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but\\nsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole;\\nDudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one\\near, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack\\nbetween door and floor.\\n“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering\\nvoice, “look at the address — how could they possibly\\nknow where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re\\nwatching the house?”\\n \\n“Watching — spying — might be following us,”\\nmuttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\\n“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write\\nback? Tell them we don’t want — ”\\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes\\npacing up and down the kitchen.\\n“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t\\nget an answer. ... Yes, that’s best ... we won’t do\\nanything. ...”\\n“But — ”\\n“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we\\nswear when we took him in we’d stamp out that\\ndangerous nonsense?”\\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle\\nVernon did something he’d never done before; he\\nvisited Harry in his cupboard.\\n“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle\\nVernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s\\nwriting to me?”\\n“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said\\nUncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.”\\n“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my\\ncupboard on it.”\\n“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of\\nspiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep\\nbreaths and then forced his face into a smile, which\\nlooked quite painful.\\n \\n“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt\\nand I have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit\\nbig for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved\\ninto Dudley’s second bedroom.”\\n“Why?” said Harry.\\n“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this\\nstuff upstairs, now.”\\nThe Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors\\n(usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where\\nDudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys\\nand things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It\\nonly took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything\\nhe owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat\\ndown on the bed and stared around him. Nearly\\neverything in here was broken. The month-old video\\ncamera was lying on top of a small, working tank\\nDudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s\\ndog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television\\nset, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite\\nprogram had been canceled; there was a large\\nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley\\nhad swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was\\nup on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley\\nhad sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They\\nwere the only things in the room that looked as\\nthough they’d never been touched.\\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling\\nat his mother, “I don’t want him in there ... I need\\nthat room ... make him get out. ...”\\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday\\nhe’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d\\nrather be back in his cupboard with that letter than\\nup here without it.\\n \\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet.\\nDudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his\\nfather with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose,\\nkicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through\\nthe greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room\\nback. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday\\nand bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall.\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each\\nother darkly.\\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to\\nbe trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get\\nit. They heard him banging things with his Smelting\\nstick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted,\\n“There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest\\nBedroom, 4 Privet Drive — ’ ”\\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his\\nseat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him.\\nUncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to\\nget the letter from him, which was made difficult by\\nthe fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around\\nthe neck from behind. After a minute of confused\\nfighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the\\nSmelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up,\\ngasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his\\nhand.\\n“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he\\nwheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.”\\nHarry walked round and round his new room.\\nSomeone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and\\nthey seemed to know he hadn’t received his first\\nletter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this\\ntime he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.\\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next\\nmorning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed\\n \\nsilently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole\\ndownstairs without turning on any of the lights.\\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of\\nPrivet Drive and get the letters for number four first.\\nHis heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall\\ntoward the front door —\\n“AAAAARRRGH ! ”\\nHarry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something\\nbig and squashy on the doormat — something alive\\\\\\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry\\nrealized that the big, squashy something had been his\\nuncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot\\nof the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making\\nsure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been\\ntrying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an\\nhour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea.\\nHarry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by\\nthe time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into\\nUncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters\\naddressed in green ink.\\n“I want — ” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing\\nthe letters into pieces before his eyes.\\nUncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at\\nhome and nailed up the mail slot.\\n“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a\\nmouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll\\njust give up.”\\n“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”\\n“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways,\\nPetunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle\\n \\nVernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of\\nfruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for\\nHarry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they\\nhad been pushed under the door, slotted through the\\nsides, and a few even forced through the small\\nwindow in the downstairs bathroom.\\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all\\nthe letters, he got out a hammer and nails and\\nboarded up the cracks around the front and back\\ndoors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe\\nThrough the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at\\nsmall noises.\\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand.\\nTwenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the\\nhouse, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two\\ndozen eggs that their very confused milkman had\\nhanded Aunt Petunia through the living room\\nwindow. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone\\ncalls to the post office and the dairy trying to find\\nsomeone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the\\nletters in her food processor.\\n“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?”\\nDudley asked Harry in amazement.\\n•k k k\\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the\\nbreakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\\n“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully\\nas he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no\\ndamn letters today — ”\\n \\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney\\nas he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of\\nthe head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came\\npelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys\\nducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch\\none —\\n“Out! OUT!”\\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and\\nthrew him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and\\nDudley had run out with their arms over their faces,\\nUncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could\\nhear the letters still streaming into the room,\\nbouncing off the walls and floor.\\n“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak\\ncalmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at\\nthe same time. “I want you all back here in five\\nminutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack\\nsome clothes. No arguments!”\\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache\\nmissing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later\\nthey had wrenched their way through the boarded-up\\ndoors and were in the car, speeding toward the\\nhighway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his\\nfather had hit him round the head for holding them\\nup while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and\\ncomputer in his sports bag.\\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t\\ndare ask where they were going. Every now and then\\nUncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in\\nthe opposite direction for a while.\\n“Shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,” he would mutter\\nwhenever he did this.\\n \\nThey didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall\\nDudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day\\nin his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television\\nprograms he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so\\nlong without blowing up an alien on his computer.\\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-\\nlooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley\\nand Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp,\\nmusty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake,\\nsitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of\\npassing cars and wondering...\\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on\\ntoast for breakfast the next day. They had just\\nfinished when the owner of the hotel came over to\\ntheir table.\\n“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I\\ngot about an ’undred of these at the front desk.”\\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink\\naddress:\\nMr. H. Potter\\nRoom 1 7\\nRailview Hotel\\nCokeworth\\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon\\nknocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\\n“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up\\nquickly and following her from the dining room.\\n•k k k\\n \\n“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt\\nPetunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle\\nVernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was\\nlooking for, none of them knew. He drove them into\\nthe middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook\\nhis head, got back in the car, and off they went again.\\nThe same thing happened in the middle of a plowed\\nfield, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the\\ntop of a multilevel parking garage.\\n“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt\\nPetunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had\\nparked at the coast, locked them all inside the car,\\nand disappeared.\\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the\\ncar. Dudley sniveled.\\n“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great\\nHumberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with\\na television.”\\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was\\nMonday — and you could usually count on Dudley to\\nknow the days of the week, because of television —\\nthen tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh\\nbirthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly\\nfun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat\\nhanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still,\\nyou weren’t eleven every day.\\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was\\nalso carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer\\nAunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.\\n“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on!\\nEveryone out!”\\n \\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was\\npointing at what looked like a large rock way out at\\nsea. Perched on top of the rock was the most\\nmiserable little shack you could imagine. One thing\\nwas certain, there was no television in there.\\n“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon\\ngleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this\\ngentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”\\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them,\\npointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat\\nbobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\\n“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon,\\n“so all aboard!”\\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain\\ncrept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped\\ntheir faces. After what seemed like hours they\\nreached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and\\nsliding, led the way to the broken-down house.\\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of\\nseaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the\\nwooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty.\\nThere were only two rooms.\\nUncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips\\neach and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the\\nempty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\\n“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said\\ncheerfully.\\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought\\nnobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a\\nstorm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though\\nthe thought didn’t cheer him up at all.\\n \\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around\\nthem. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls\\nof the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy\\nwindows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in\\nthe second room and made up a bed for Dudley on\\nthe moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off\\nto the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find\\nthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under\\nthe thinnest, most ragged blanket.\\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the\\nnight went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and\\nturned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach\\nrumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned\\nby the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight.\\nThe lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was\\ndangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told\\nHarry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and\\nwatched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the\\nDursleys would remember at all, wondering where the\\nletter writer was now.\\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak\\noutside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in,\\nalthough he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes\\nto go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so\\nfull of letters when they got back that he’d be able to\\nsteal one somehow.\\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard\\non the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what\\nwas that funny crunching noise? Was the rock\\ncrumbling into the sea?\\nOne minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds\\n... twenty ... ten ... nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley\\nup, just to annoy him — three ... two ... one ...\\nBOOM.\\n \\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright,\\nstaring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking\\nto come in.\\n \\nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.\\n“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly.\\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon\\ncame skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in\\nhis hands — now they knew what had been in the\\nlong, thin package he had brought with them.\\n“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!”\\nThere was a pause. Then —\\nSMASH!\\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean\\noff its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat\\non the floor.\\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His\\nface was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy\\nmane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could\\n \\nmake out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under\\nall the hair.\\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so\\nthat his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down,\\npicked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its\\nframe. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little.\\nHe turned to look at them all.\\n“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not\\nbeen an easy journey. ...”\\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen\\nwith fear.\\n“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.\\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother,\\nwho was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\\n“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.\\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face\\nand saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\\n“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the\\ngiant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer\\nmom’s eyes.”\\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\\n“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You\\nare breaking and entering!”\\n“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the\\ngiant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the\\ngun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot\\nas easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw\\nit into a corner of the room.\\n \\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a\\nmouse being trodden on.\\n“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back\\non the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got\\nsummat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some\\npoint, but it’ll taste all right.”\\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled\\na slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with\\ntrembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate\\ncake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green\\nicing.\\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank\\nyou, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth,\\nand what he said instead was, “Who are you?”\\nThe giant chuckled.\\n“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid,\\nKeeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.”\\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s\\nwhole arm.\\n“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his\\nhands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if\\nyeh’ve got it, mind.”\\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled\\nchip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the\\nfireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but\\nwhen he drew back a second later, there was a\\nroaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with\\nflickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over\\nhim as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.\\n \\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged\\nunder his weight, and began taking all sorts of things\\nout of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a\\nsquashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot,\\nseveral chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber\\nliquid that he took a swig from before starting to\\nmake tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and\\nsmell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while\\nthe giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat,\\njuicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley\\nfidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t\\ntouch anything he gives you, Dudley.”\\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\\n“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’\\nanymore, Dursley, don’ worry.”\\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry\\nhe had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he\\nstill couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as\\nnobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,\\n“I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.”\\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with\\nthe back of his hand.\\n“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I\\ntold yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll\\nknow all about Hogwarts, o’ course.”\\n“Er — no,” said Harry.\\nHagrid looked shocked.\\n“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.\\n“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the\\nDursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s\\n \\nthem as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’\\nyer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even\\nknow abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh\\nnever wonder where yer parents learned it all?”\\n“All what?” asked Harry.\\n“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one\\nsecond!”\\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill\\nthe whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against\\nthe wall.\\n“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys,\\n“that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ —\\nabout ANYTHING?”\\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to\\nschool, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.\\n“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do\\nmath and stuff.”\\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About\\nour world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’\\nworld.”\\n“What world?”\\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\\n“DURSLEY!” he boomed.\\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered\\nsomething that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid\\nstared wildly at Harry.\\n \\n“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he\\nsaid. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.”\\n“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were\\nthey?”\\n“Yeh don’ know ... yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran his\\nfingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a\\nbewildered stare.\\n“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.\\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\\n“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid\\nyou to tell the boy anything!”\\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have\\nquailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him;\\nwhen Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with\\nrage.\\n“You never told him? Never told him what was in the\\nletter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw\\nDumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from\\nhim all these years?”\\n“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.\\n“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid.\\n“Harry — yer a wizard.”\\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and\\nthe whistling wind could be heard.\\n \\n“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.\\n“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down\\non the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’\\na thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained\\nup a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else\\nwould yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read\\nyer letter.”\\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the\\nyellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr.\\nH. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He\\npulled out the letter and read:\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL\\no/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.\\nWarlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of\\nWizards)\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been\\naccepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\\nWizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary\\nbooks and equipment.\\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no\\nlater than July 31.\\nYours sincerely,\\nMinerva McGonagall,\\nDeputy Headmistress\\n \\nQuestions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks\\nand he couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few\\nminutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they\\nawait my owl?”\\n“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid,\\nclapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to\\nknock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket\\ninside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live,\\nrather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of\\nparchment. With his tongue between his teeth he\\nscribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\\nGiven Harry his letter.\\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\\nWeather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.\\nHagrid\\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which\\nclamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw\\nthe owl out into the storm. Then he came back and\\nsat down as though this was as normal as talking on\\nthe telephone.\\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it\\nquickly.\\n“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment,\\nUncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very\\nangry, moved into the firelight.\\n“He’s not going,” he said.\\nHagrid grunted.\\n \\n“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he\\nsaid.\\n“A what?” said Harry, interested.\\n“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic\\nfolk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a\\nfamily o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”\\n“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to\\nthat rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp\\nit out of him! Wizard indeed!”\\n“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a\\nwizard?”\\n“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew\\\\ Of\\ncourse we knew! How could you not be, my dratted\\nsister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just\\nlike that and disappeared off to that — that school —\\nand came home every vacation with her pockets full\\nof frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the\\nonly one who saw her for what she was — a freak!\\nBut for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this\\nand Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in\\nthe family!”\\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went\\nranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all\\nthis for years.\\n“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and\\ngot married and had you, and of course I knew you’d\\nbe just the same, just as strange, just as — as —\\nabnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got\\nherself blown up and we got landed with you!”\\n \\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his\\nvoice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a\\ncar crash!”\\n“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily\\nthat the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How\\ncould a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an\\noutrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own\\nstory when every kid in our world knows his name!”\\n“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.\\nThe anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked\\nsuddenly anxious.\\n“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried\\nvoice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there\\nmight be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh\\ndidn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right\\nperson ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t\\ngo off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”\\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\n“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh —\\nmind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry,\\nparts of it. ...”\\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds,\\nand then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a\\nperson called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his\\nname, everyone in our world knows — ”\\n“Who?”\\n“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No\\none does.”\\n“Why not?”\\n \\n“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared.\\nBlimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard\\nwho went ... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse.\\nWorse than worse. His name was ...”\\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\\n“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.\\n“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid\\nshuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this\\n— this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started\\nlookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid,\\nsome just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was\\ngettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry.\\nDidn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly\\nwith strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things\\nhappened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up\\nto him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only\\nsafe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s\\nthe only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare\\ntry takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.\\n“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’\\nwizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts\\nin their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-\\nWho never tried to get ’em on his side before . . .\\nprobably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter\\nwant anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.\\n“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em ... maybe\\nhe just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows\\nis, he turned up in the village where you was all\\nliving, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a\\nyear old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ”\\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted\\nhandkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a\\nfoghorn.\\n \\n“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum\\nan’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway\\n“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the\\nreal myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too.\\nWanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or\\nmaybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do\\nit. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer\\nforehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh\\nget when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took\\ncare of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it\\ndidn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry.\\nNo one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one\\nexcept you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches\\nan’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones,\\nthe Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you\\nlived.”\\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry’s mind.\\nAs Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the\\nblinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had\\never remembered it before — and he remembered\\nsomething else, for the first time in his life: a high,\\ncold, cruel laugh.\\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\\n“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on\\nDumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...”\\n“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped;\\nhe had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.\\nUncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his\\ncourage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were\\nclenched.\\n“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept\\nthere’s something strange about you, probably\\n \\nnothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as\\nfor all this about your parents, well, they were\\nweirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off\\nwithout them in my opinion — asked for all they got,\\ngetting mixed up with these wizarding types — just\\nwhat I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky\\nend — ”\\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and\\ndrew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat.\\nPointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said,\\n“I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one\\nmore word ...”\\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella\\nby a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed\\nagain; he flattened himself against the wall and fell\\nsilent.\\n“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and\\nsitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged\\nright down to the floor.\\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask,\\nhundreds of them.\\n“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-\\nKnow-Who?”\\n“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same\\nnight he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more\\nfamous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see ... he was\\ngettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?\\n“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno\\nif he had enough human left in him to die. Some say\\nhe’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’\\nbelieve it. People who was on his side came back ter\\n \\nours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’\\nreckon they could’ve done if he was cornin’ back.\\n“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but\\nlost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause\\nsomethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was\\nsomethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on —\\n/ dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’\\nabout you stumped him, all right.”\\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect\\nblazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling\\npleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a\\nhorrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he\\npossibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by\\nDudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle\\nVernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they\\nbeen turned into warty toads every time they’d tried\\nto lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the\\ngreatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had\\nalways been able to kick him around like a football?\\n“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have\\nmade a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”\\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when\\nyou was scared or angry?”\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think\\nabout it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his\\naunt and uncle furious with him had happened when\\nhe, Harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by\\nDudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of\\ntheir reach . . . dreading going to school with that\\nridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow\\nback . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him,\\n \\nhadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he\\nwas doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that\\nHagrid was positively beaming at him.\\n“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you\\nwait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.”\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a\\nfight.\\n“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s\\ngoing to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve\\nread those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish —\\nspell books and wands and — ”\\n“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop\\nhim,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s\\nson goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been\\ndown ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest\\nschool of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven\\nyears there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with\\nyoungsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be\\nunder the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had,\\nAlbus Dumbled — ”\\n“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD\\nFOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle\\nVernon.\\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his\\numbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER — ” he\\nthundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE\\n— IN — FRONT — OF — ME!”\\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the\\nair to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet\\nlight, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and\\n \\nthe next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with\\nhis hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in\\npain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a\\ncurly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and\\nDudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified\\nlook at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his\\nbeard.\\n“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it\\ndidn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig,\\nbut I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there\\nwasn’t much left ter do.”\\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy\\neyebrows.\\n“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at\\nHogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do\\nmagic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter\\nfollow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’\\nthe reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — ”\\n“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.\\n“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er —\\ngot expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year.\\nThey snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But\\nDumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great\\nman, Dumbledore.”\\n“Why were you expelled?”\\n“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,”\\nsaid Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer\\nbooks an’ that.”\\n \\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\\n“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it\\nwriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in\\none o’ the pockets.”\\n \\nDIAGON ALLY\\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he\\ncould tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\\n“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a\\ngiant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a\\nschool for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at\\nhome in my cupboard.”\\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\\nAnd there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry\\nthought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his\\neyes. It had been such a good dream.\\nTap. Tap. Tap.\\n“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”\\nHe sat up and Hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off him. The\\nhut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid\\nhimself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there\\n \\nwas an owl rapping its claw on the window, a\\nnewspaper held in its beak.\\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as\\nthough a large balloon was swelling inside him. He\\nwent straight to the window and jerked it open. The\\nowl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of\\nHagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered\\nonto the floor and began to attack Hagrid ’s coat.\\n“Don’t do that.”\\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it\\nsnapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on\\nsavaging the coat.\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl — ”\\n“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n“What?”\\n“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the\\npockets.”\\nHagrid ’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but\\npockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of\\nstring, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, Harry\\npulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\\n“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.\\n“Knuts?”\\n“The little bronze ones.”\\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl\\nheld out his leg so Harry could put the money into a\\n \\nsmall leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off\\nthrough the open window.\\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\n“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter\\nLondon an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.”\\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking\\nat them. He had just thought of something that made\\nhim feel as though the happy balloon inside him had\\ngot a puncture.\\n“Urn — Hagrid?”\\n“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge\\nboots.\\n“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle\\nVernon last night ... he won’t pay for me to go and\\nlearn magic.”\\n“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up\\nand scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents\\ndidn’t leave yeh anything?”\\n“But if their house was destroyed — ”\\n“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah,\\nfirst stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a\\nsausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no\\nteh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”\\n“Wizards have banks?”\\n“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”\\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\\n \\n“Goblins?”\\n“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh\\nthat. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the\\nsafest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter\\nkeep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’\\nfact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore.\\nHogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly.\\n“He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him.\\nFetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows\\nhe can trust me, see.\\n“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”\\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was\\nquite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight.\\nThe boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with\\na lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\\n“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around\\nfor another boat.\\n“Flew,” said Hagrid.\\n“Flew?”\\n“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter\\nuse magic now I’ve got yeh.”\\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at\\nHagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\\n“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving\\nHarry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er\\n— speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not\\nmentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”\\n“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic.\\nHagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it\\n \\ntwice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward\\nland.\\n“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?”\\nHarry asked.\\n“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his\\nnewspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons\\nguardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta\\nfind yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under\\nLondon, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die\\nof hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter\\nget yer hands on summat.”\\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read\\nhis newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned\\nfrom Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone\\nwhile they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d\\nnever had so many questions in his life.\\n“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid\\nmuttered, turning the page.\\n“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he\\ncould stop himself.\\n“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer\\nMinister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so\\nold Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there\\nwas one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every\\nmorning, askin’ fer advice.”\\n“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”\\n“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles\\nthat there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the\\ncountry.”\\n“Why?”\\n \\n“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic\\nsolutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left\\nalone.”\\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the\\nharbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and\\nthey clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked\\nthrough the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t\\nblame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as\\nanyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary\\nthings like parking meters and saying loudly, “See\\nthat, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”\\n“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep\\nup, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?”\\n“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a\\ndragon.”\\n“You’d like one?”\\n“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”\\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to\\nLondon in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t\\nunderstand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the\\nbills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid\\ntook up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a\\ncanary-yellow circus tent.\\n“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted\\nstitches.\\nHarry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\\n \\n“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything\\nyeh need.”\\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t\\nnoticed the night before, and read:\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL\\no/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\nUNIFORM\\nFirst-year students will require:\\n1 .

Although\\nHagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was\\nobviously not used to getting there in an ordinary\\nway. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the\\nUnderground, and complained loudly that the seats\\nwere too small and the trains too slow.\\n \\n“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without\\nmagic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down\\nescalator that led up to a bustling road lined with\\nshops.\\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily;\\nall Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They\\npassed book shops and music stores, hamburger\\nrestaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as\\nif it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an\\nordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there\\nreally be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath\\nthem? Were there really shops that sold spell books\\nand broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge\\njoke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t\\nknown that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he\\nmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though\\neverything Hagrid had told him so far was\\nunbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.\\n“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky\\nCauldron. It’s a famous place.”\\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t\\npointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was\\nthere. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their\\neyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the\\nrecord shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the\\nLeaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most\\npeculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.\\nBefore he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him\\ninside.\\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A\\nfew old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny\\nglasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long\\npipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old\\nbartender, who was quite bald and looked like a\\ntoothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped\\n \\nwhen they walked in. Everyone seemed to know\\nHagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the\\nbartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual,\\nHagrid?”\\n“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid,\\nclapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and\\nmaking Harry’s knees buckle.\\n“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is\\nthis — can this be — ?”\\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely\\nstill and silent.\\n“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry\\nPotter ... what an honor.”\\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward\\nHarry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\\n“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”\\nHarry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking\\nat him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it\\nwithout realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was\\nbeaming.\\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the\\nnext moment, Harry found himself shaking hands\\nwith everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting\\nyou at last.”\\n“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”\\n“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a\\nflutter.”\\n \\n“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the\\nname, Dedalus Diggle.”\\n“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s\\ntop hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me\\nonce in a shop.”\\n“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking\\naround at everyone. “Did you hear that? He\\nremembers me!”\\nHarry shook hands again and again — Doris\\nCrockford kept coming back for more.\\nA pale young man made his way forward, very\\nnervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\\n“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor\\nQuirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”\\n“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping\\nHarry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to\\nmeet you.”\\n“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”\\n“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered\\nProfessor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think\\nabout it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?”\\nHe laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your\\nequipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-\\nbook on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at\\nthe very thought.\\nBut the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep\\nHarry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get\\naway from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make\\nhimself heard over the babble.\\n \\n“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”\\nDoris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time,\\nand Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a\\nsmall, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but\\na trash can and a few weeds.\\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\\n“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even\\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind\\nyou, he’s usually tremblin’.”\\n“Is he always that nervous?”\\n“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine\\nwhile he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a\\nyear off ter get some firsthand experience. ... They say\\nhe met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a\\nnasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same\\nsince. Scared of the students, scared of his own\\nsubject — now, where’s me umbrella?”\\nVampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming.\\nHagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall\\nabove the trash can.\\n“Three up ... two across ...” he muttered. “Right,\\nstand back, Harry.”\\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his\\numbrella.\\nThe brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in\\nthe middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider\\nand wider — a second later they were facing an\\narchway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway\\nonto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of\\nsight.\\n \\n“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”\\nHe grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped\\nthrough the archway. Harry looked quickly over his\\nshoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back\\ninto solid wall.\\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons\\noutside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes —\\nCopper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring —\\nCollapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\\n“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we\\ngotta get yer money first.”\\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He\\nturned his head in every direction as they walked up\\nthe street, trying to look at everything at once: the\\nshops, the things outside them, the people doing their\\nshopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary\\nwas shaking her head as they passed, saying,\\n“Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.”\\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign\\nsaying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech,\\nBarn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about\\nHarry’s age had their noses pressed against a window\\nwith broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of\\nthem say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest\\never — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling\\ntelescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had\\nnever seen before, windows stacked with barrels of\\nbat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell\\nbooks, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles,\\nglobes of the moon. ...\\n“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.\\n \\nThey had reached a snowy white building that\\ntowered over the other little shops. Standing beside\\nits burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of\\nscarlet and gold, was —\\n“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they\\nwalked up the white stone steps toward him. The\\ngoblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a\\nswarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry\\nnoticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they\\nwalked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of\\ndoors, silver this time, with words engraved upon\\nthem:\\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\\nA treasure that was never yours,\\nThief, you have been warned, beware\\nOf finding more than treasure there.\\n“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said\\nHagrid.\\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors\\nand they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred\\nmore goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long\\ncounter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in\\nbrass scales, examining precious stones through\\neyeglasses. There were too many doors to count\\n \\nleading off the hall, and yet more goblins were\\nshowing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry\\nmade for the counter.\\n“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come\\nter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”\\n“You have his key, sir?”\\n“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started\\nemptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a\\nhandful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of\\nnumbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry\\nwatched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of\\nrubies as big as glowing coals.\\n“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden\\nkey.\\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\\n“That seems to be in order.”\\n“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor\\nDumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out\\nhis chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault\\nseven hundred and thirteen.”\\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\\n“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will\\nhave someone take you down to both vaults.\\nGriphook!”\\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had\\ncrammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets,\\nhe and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the\\ndoors leading off the hall.\\n \\n“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred\\nand thirteen?” Harry asked.\\n“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very\\nsecret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me.\\nMore’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”\\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who\\nhad expected more marble, was surprised. They were\\nin a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming\\ntorches. It sloped steeply downward and there were\\nlittle railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled\\nand a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward\\nthem. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty\\n— and were off.\\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting\\npassages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right,\\nleft, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The\\nrattling cart seemed to know its own way, because\\nGriphook wasn’t steering.\\nHarry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them,\\nbut he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw\\na burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted\\naround to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they\\nplunged even deeper, passing an underground lake\\nwhere huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the\\nceiling and floor.\\n“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise\\nof the cart, “what’s the difference between a\\nstalagmite and a stalactite?”\\n“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’\\nask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be\\nsick.”\\n \\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at\\nlast beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid\\ngot out and had to lean against the wall to stop his\\nknees from trembling.\\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke\\ncame billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped.\\nInside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver.\\nHeaps of little bronze Knuts.\\n“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.\\nAll Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t\\nhave known about this or they’d have had it from him\\nfaster than blinking. How often had they complained\\nhow much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time\\nthere had been a small fortune belonging to him,\\nburied deep under London.\\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\n“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained.\\n“Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine\\nKnuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should\\nbe enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest\\nsafe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven\\nhundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go\\nmore slowly?”\\n“One speed only,” said Griphook.\\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering\\nspeed. The air became colder and colder as they\\nhurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over\\nan underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the\\nside to try to see what was down at the dark bottom,\\nbut Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff\\nof his neck.\\n \\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\\n“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked\\nthe door gently with one of his long fingers and it\\nsimply melted away.\\n“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be\\nsucked through the door and trapped in there,” said\\nGriphook.\\n“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?”\\nHarry asked.\\n“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a\\nrather nasty grin.\\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this\\ntop security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned\\nforward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at\\nthe very least — but at first he thought it was empty.\\nThen he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up\\nin brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up\\nand tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to\\nknow what it was, but knew better than to ask.\\n“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to\\nme on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth\\nshut,” said Hagrid.\\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the\\nsunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where\\nto run first now that he had a bag full of money. He\\ndidn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to\\na pound to know that he was holding more money\\nthan he’d had in his whole life — more money than\\neven Dudley had ever had.\\n \\n“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding\\ntoward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions.\\n“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a\\npick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them\\nGringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry\\nentered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.\\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all\\nin mauve.\\n“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to\\nspeak. “Got the lot here — another young man being\\nfitted up just now, in fact.”\\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed\\nface was standing on a footstool while a second witch\\npinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood\\nHarry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over\\nhis head, and began to pin it to the right length.\\n“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\n“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s\\nup the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had\\na bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them\\noff to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years\\ncan’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into\\ngetting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.”\\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.\\n“No,” said Harry.\\n“Play Quidditch at all?”\\n \\n“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth\\nQuidditch could be.\\n“ I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to\\nplay for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know\\nwhat House you 11 be in yet?”\\n“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do\\nthey, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family\\nhave been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d\\nleave, wouldn’t you?”\\n“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a\\nbit more interesting.\\n“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly,\\nnodding toward the front window. Hagrid was\\nstanding there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two\\nlarge ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\\n“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know\\nsomething the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.”\\n“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of\\nservant, isn’t he?”\\n“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the\\nboy less and less every second.\\n“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a\\nhut on the school grounds and every now and then he\\ngets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire\\nto his bed.”\\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\\n \\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he\\nwith you? Where are your parents?”\\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel\\nmuch like going into the matter with this boy.\\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all.\\n“But they were our kind, weren’t they?”\\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you\\nmean.”\\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in,\\ndo you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been\\nbrought up to know our ways. Some of them have\\nnever even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,\\nimagine. I think they should keep it in the old\\nwizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said,\\n“That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for\\nan excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down\\nfrom the footstool.\\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the\\ndrawling boy.\\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid\\nhad bought him (chocolate and raspberry with\\nchopped nuts).\\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid.\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment\\nand quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a\\nbottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When\\nthey had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s\\nQuidditch?”\\n \\n“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know —\\nnot knowin’ about Quidditch!”\\n“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told\\nHagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.\\n“ — and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t\\neven be allowed in — ”\\n“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh\\nwere — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his\\nparents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in\\nthe Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.\\nAnyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best\\nI ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a\\nlong line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what\\nshe had fer a sister!”\\n“So what is Quidditch?”\\n“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in\\nthe Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch —\\nplayed up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four\\nballs — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”\\n“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”\\n“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says\\nHufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ”\\n“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.\\n“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly.\\n“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad\\nwho wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.”\\n“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”\\n“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.\\n \\nThey bought Harry’s school books in a shop called\\nFlourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to\\nthe ceiling with books as large as paving stones\\nbound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in\\ncovers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a\\nfew books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley,\\nwho never read anything, would have been wild to get\\nhis hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to\\ndrag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses\\n(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies\\nwith the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,\\nTongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor\\nVindictus Viridian.\\n“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”\\n“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter\\nuse magic in the Muggle world except in very special\\ncircumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh\\ncouldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot\\nmore study before yeh get ter that level.”\\nHagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron,\\neither (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice\\nset of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a\\ncollapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the\\nApothecary, which was fascinating enough to make\\nup for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and\\nrotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the\\nfloor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders\\nlined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs,\\nand snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While\\nHagrid asked the man behind the counter for a\\nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry,\\nHarry himself examined silver unicorn horns at\\ntwenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-\\nblack beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\\n \\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list\\nagain.\\n“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got\\nyeh a birthday present.”\\nHarry felt himself go red.\\n“You don’t have to — ”\\n“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer\\nanimal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years\\nago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they\\nmake me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want\\nowls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’\\neverythin’.”\\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl\\nEmporium, which had been dark and full of rustling\\nand flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a\\nlarge cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep\\nwith her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop\\nstammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor\\nQuirrell.\\n“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect\\nyou’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just\\nOllivanders left now — only place fer wands,\\nOllivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”\\nA magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really\\nlooking forward to.\\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold\\nletters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine\\nWands since 382b. c. A single wand lay on a faded\\npurple cushion in the dusty window.\\n \\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the\\nshop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place,\\nempty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid\\nsat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had\\nentered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new\\nquestions that had just occurred to him and looked\\ninstead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly\\nright up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of\\nhis neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here\\nseemed to tingle with some secret magic.\\n“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped.\\nHagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a\\nloud crunching noise and he got quickly off the\\nspindly chair.\\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale\\neyes shining like moons through the gloom of the\\nshop.\\n“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.\\n“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be\\nseeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question.\\n“You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday\\nshe was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten\\nand a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow.\\nNice wand for charm work.”\\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished\\nhe would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\n“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany\\nwand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and\\nexcellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father\\nfavored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the\\nwizard, of course.”\\n \\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry\\nwere almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself\\nreflected in those misty eyes.\\n“And that’s where ...”\\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s\\nforehead with a long, white finger.\\n“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said\\nsoftly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful\\nwand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well,\\nif I’d known what that wand was going out into the\\nworld to do. ...”\\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted\\nHagrid.\\n“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.\\n... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”\\n“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.\\n“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it\\nin half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander,\\nsuddenly stern.\\n“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his\\nfeet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added\\nbrightly.\\n“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander\\nsharply.\\n“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he\\ngripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\\n“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a\\npiercing look. “Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.”\\n \\nHe pulled a long tape measure with silver markings\\nout of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”\\n“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.\\n“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry\\nfrom shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder\\nto floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he\\nmeasured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core\\nof a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use\\nunicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the\\nheartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are\\nthe same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or\\nphoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will\\nnever get such good results with another wizard’s\\nwand.”\\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which\\nwas measuring between his nostrils, was doing this\\non its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the\\nshelves, taking down boxes.\\n“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure\\ncrumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr.\\nPotter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon\\nheartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take\\nit and give it a wave.”\\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it\\naround a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his\\nhand almost at once.\\n“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite\\nwhippy. Try — ”\\nHarry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand\\nwhen it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\\n \\n“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a\\nhalf inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”\\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr.\\nOllivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands\\nwas mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair,\\nbut the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the\\nshelves, the happier he seemed to become.\\n“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the\\nperfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now —\\nyes, why not — unusual combination — holly and\\nphoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”\\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his\\nfingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it\\nswishing down through the dusty air and a stream of\\nred and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,\\nthrowing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid\\nwhooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh,\\nbravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ...\\nhow curious ... how very curious ...”\\nHe put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it\\nin brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious\\n“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”\\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\n“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter.\\nEvery single wand. It so happens that the phoenix\\nwhose tail feather is in your wand, gave another\\nfeather — just one other. It is very curious indeed\\nthat you should be destined for this wand when its\\nbrother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”\\nHarry swallowed.\\n \\n“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed\\nhow these things happen. The wand chooses the\\nwizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great\\nthings from you, Mr. Potter. ... After all, He-Who-\\nMust-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes,\\nbut great.”\\nHarry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr.\\nOllivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for\\nhis wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his\\nshop.\\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry\\nand Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley,\\nback through the wall, back through the Leaky\\nCauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as\\nthey walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how\\nmuch people were gawking at them on the\\nUnderground, laden as they were with all their funny-\\nshaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its\\ncage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into\\nPaddington station; Harry only realized where they\\nwere when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\\n“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he\\nsaid.\\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on\\nplastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around.\\nEverything looked so strange, somehow.\\n“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.\\nHarry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the\\nbest birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his\\nhamburger, trying to find the words.\\n“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All\\nthose people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor\\n \\nQuirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don’t know anything\\nabout magic at all. How can they expect great things?\\nI’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m\\nfamous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-,\\nsorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”\\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard\\nand eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\\n“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough.\\nEveryone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll\\nbe just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve\\nbeen singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll\\nhave a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do,\\n’smatter of fact.”\\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take\\nhim back to the Dursleys, then handed him an\\nenvelope.\\n“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September\\n— King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems\\nwith the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll\\nknow where to find me. ... See yeh soon, Harry.”\\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to\\nwatch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his\\nseat and pressed his nose against the window, but he\\nblinked and Hagrid had gone.\\n \\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM\\nNINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\\nHarry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun.\\nTrue, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t\\nstay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle\\nVernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him\\nto do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t\\nspeak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they\\nacted as though any chair with Harry in it were\\nempty. Although this was an improvement in many\\nways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for\\ncompany. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name\\nhe had found in A History of Magic. His school books\\nwere very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late\\ninto the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the\\nopen window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt\\nPetunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because\\nHedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night\\nbefore he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day\\n \\non the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall,\\ncounting down to September the first.\\nOn the last day of August he thought he’d better\\nspeak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s\\nCross station the next day, so he went down to the\\nliving room where they were watching a quiz show on\\ntelevision. He cleared his throat to let them know he\\nwas there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the\\nroom.\\n“Er — Uncle Vernon?”\\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\\n“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to\\ngo to Hogwarts.”\\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\\n“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”\\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\\n“Thank you.”\\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon\\nactually spoke.\\n“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train.\\nMagic carpets all got punctures, have they?”\\nHarry didn’t say anything.\\n“Where is this school, anyway?”\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first\\ntime. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of\\nhis pocket.\\n \\n“I just take the train from platform nine and three-\\nquarters at eleven o’clock,” he read.\\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\\n“Platform what?”\\n“Nine and three-quarters.”\\n“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no\\nplatform nine and three-quarters.”\\n“It’s on my ticket.”\\n“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of\\nthem. You 11 see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take\\nyou to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London\\ntomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”\\n“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying\\nto keep things friendly.\\n“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle\\nVernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before\\nhe goes to Smeltings.”\\nHarry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was\\ntoo excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up\\nand pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to\\nwalk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d\\nchange on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet\\nagain to make sure he had everything he needed, saw\\nthat Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then\\npaced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.\\nTwo hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been\\nloaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had\\ntalked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had\\nset off.\\n \\nThey reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle\\nVernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and\\nwheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this\\nwas strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead,\\nfacing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\\n“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform\\nten. Your platform should be somewhere in the\\nmiddle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do\\nthey?”\\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic\\nnumber nine over one platform and a big plastic\\nnumber ten over the one next to it, and in the middle,\\nnothing at all.\\n“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even\\nnastier smile. He left without another word. Harry\\nturned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of\\nthem were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry.\\nWhat on earth was he going to do? He was starting to\\nattract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d\\nhave to ask someone.\\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention\\nplatform nine and three-quarters. The guard had\\nnever heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t\\neven tell him what part of the country it was in, he\\nstarted to get annoyed, as though Harry was being\\nstupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for\\nthe train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said\\nthere wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away,\\nmuttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying\\nhard not to panic. According to the large clock over\\nthe arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on\\nthe train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it;\\nhe was stranded in the middle of a station with a\\ntrunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard\\nmoney, and a large owl.\\n \\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you\\nhad to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to\\nget into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get\\nout his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s\\nstand between platforms nine and ten.\\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind\\nhim and he caught a few words of what they were\\nsaying.\\n“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ”\\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump\\nwoman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming\\nred hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like\\nHarry’s in front of him — and they had an owl.\\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them.\\nThey stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear\\nwhat they were saying.\\n“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’\\nmother.\\n“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-\\nheaded, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go\\n“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right,\\nPercy, you go first.”\\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward\\nplatforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to\\nblink in case he missed it — but just as the boy\\nreached the dividing barrier between the two\\nplatforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in\\nfront of him and by the time the last backpack had\\ncleared away, the boy had vanished.\\n \\n“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.\\n“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly,\\nwoman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell\\nI’m George?”\\n“Sorry, George, dear.”\\n“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he\\nwent. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he\\nmust have done so, because a second later, he had\\ngone — but how had he done it?\\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the\\nbarrier — he was almost there — and then, quite\\nsuddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.\\nThere was nothing else for it.\\n“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.\\n“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s\\nnew, too.”\\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He\\nwas tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands\\nand feet, and a long nose.\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t\\nknow how to — ”\\n“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and\\nHarry nodded.\\n“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk\\nstraight at the barrier between platforms nine and\\nten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into\\nit, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if\\nyou’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.”\\n \\n“Er — okay,” said Harry.\\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the\\nbarrier. It looked very solid.\\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on\\ntheir way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked\\nmore quickly. He was going to smash right into that\\nbarrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward\\non his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier\\nwas coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able\\nto stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot\\naway — he closed his eyes ready for the crash —\\nIt didn’t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his\\neyes.\\nA scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform\\npacked with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts\\nExpress, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and\\nsaw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had\\nbeen, with the words Platform Nine and Three-\\nQuarters on it. He had done it.\\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the\\nchattering crowd, while cats of every color wound\\nhere and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one\\nanother in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble\\nand the scraping of heavy trunks.\\nThe first few carriages were already packed with\\nstudents, some hanging out of the window to talk to\\ntheir families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed\\nhis cart off down the platform in search of an empty\\nseat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying,\\n“Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”\\n“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.\\n \\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small\\ncrowd.\\n“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”\\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the\\npeople around him shrieked and yelled as something\\ninside poked out a long, hairy leg.\\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found\\nan empty compartment near the end of the train. He\\nput Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and\\nheave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift\\nit up the steps but could hardly raise one end and\\ntwice he dropped it painfully on his foot.\\n“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins\\nhe’d followed through the barrier.\\n“Yes, please,” Harry panted.\\n“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”\\nWith the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked\\naway in a corner of the compartment.\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of\\nhis eyes.\\n“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly,\\npointing at Harry’s lightning scar.\\n“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?”\\n“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to\\nHarry.\\n“What?” said Harry.\\n \\n“ Harry Potter,” chorused the twins.\\n“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”\\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself\\nturning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating\\nin through the train’s open door.\\n“Fred? George? Are you there?”\\n“Coming, Mom.”\\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the\\ntrain.\\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half\\nhidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the\\nplatform and hear what they were saying. Their\\nmother had just taken out her handkerchief.\\n“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”\\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she\\ngrabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.\\n“Mom — geroff.” He wriggled free.\\n“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?”\\nsaid one of the twins.\\n“Shut up,” said Ron.\\n“Where’s Percy?” said their mother.\\n“He’s coming now.”\\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had\\nalready changed into his billowing black Hogwarts\\n \\nrobes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge\\non his chest with the letter P on it.\\n“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the\\nprefects have got two compartments to themselves — ”\\n“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins,\\nwith an air of great surprise. “You should have said\\nsomething, we had no idea.”\\n“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something\\nabout it,” said the other twin. “Once — ”\\n“Or twice — ”\\n“A minute — ”\\n“All summer — ”\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.\\n“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one\\nof the twins.\\n“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All\\nright, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl\\nwhen you get there.”\\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she\\nturned to the twins.\\n“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I\\nget one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up\\na toilet or — ”\\n“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”\\n“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”\\n \\n“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.”\\n“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”\\n“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as\\nthe twins already and his nose was still pink where\\nhis mother had rubbed it.\\n“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on\\nthe train?”\\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him\\nlooking.\\n“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in\\nthe station? Know who he is?”\\n“Who?”\\n“ Harry Potted”\\nHarry heard the little girl’s voice.\\n“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom,\\noh please. ...”\\n“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy\\nisn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really,\\nFred? How do you know?”\\n“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like\\nlightning.”\\n“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He\\nwas ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the\\nplatform.”\\n“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what\\nYou-Know-Who looks like?”\\n \\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\\n“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As\\nthough he needs reminding of that on his first day at\\nschool.”\\n“All right, keep your hair on.”\\nA whistle sounded.\\n“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys\\nclambered onto the train. They leaned out of the\\nwindow for her to kiss them good-bye, and their\\nyounger sister began to cry.\\n“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”\\n“Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.”\\n“ Georg e\\\\”\\n“Only joking, Mom.”\\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother\\nwaving and their sister, half laughing, half crying,\\nrunning to keep up with the train until it gathered too\\nmuch speed, then she fell back and waved.\\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as\\nthe train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the\\nwindow. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He\\ndidn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be\\nbetter than what he was leaving behind.\\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the\\nyoungest redheaded boy came in.\\n“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat\\nopposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.”\\n \\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He\\nglanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the\\nwindow, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he\\nstill had a black mark on his nose.\\n“Hey, Ron.”\\nThe twins were back.\\n“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train —\\nLee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.”\\n“Right,” mumbled Ron.\\n“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce\\nourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron,\\nour brother. See you later, then.”\\n“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the\\ncompartment door shut behind them.\\n“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.\\nHarry nodded.\\n“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and\\nGeorge’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got —\\nyou know ...”\\nHe pointed at Harry’s forehead.\\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning\\nscar. Ron stared.\\n“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”\\n“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.\\n \\n“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing\\nelse.”\\n“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few\\nmoments, then, as though he had suddenly realized\\nwhat he was doing, he looked quickly out of the\\nwindow again.\\n“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found\\nRon just as interesting as Ron found him.\\n“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a\\nsecond cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk\\nabout him.”\\n“So you must know loads of magic already.”\\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding\\nfamilies the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked\\nabout.\\n“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron.\\n“What are they like?”\\n“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle\\nand cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard\\nbrothers.”\\n“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking\\ngloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts.\\nYou could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and\\nCharlie have already left — Bill was head boy and\\nCharlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a\\nprefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they\\nstill get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re\\nreally funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the\\nothers, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it\\nfirst. You never get anything new, either, with five\\n \\nbrothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand,\\nand Percy’s old rat.”\\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat\\ngray rat, which was asleep.\\n“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever\\nwakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being\\nmade a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got\\nScabbers instead.”\\nRon’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said\\ntoo much, because he went back to staring out of the\\nwindow.\\nHarry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not\\nbeing able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had\\nany money in his life until a month ago, and he told\\nRon so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes\\nand never getting proper birthday presents. This\\nseemed to cheer Ron up.\\n\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything\\nabout being a wizard or about my parents or\\nVoldemort — ”\\nRon gasped.\\n“What?” said Harry.\\n“ You said You-Know-Who’s name\\\\” said Ron, sounding\\nboth shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you,\\nof all people — ”\\n“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the\\nname,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t.\\nSee what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn. ... I bet,” he\\nadded, voicing for the first time something that had\\n \\nbeen worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in\\nthe class.”\\n“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from\\nMuggle families and they learn quick enough.”\\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried\\nthem out of London. Now they were speeding past\\nfields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a\\ntime, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering\\noutside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman\\nslid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart,\\ndears?”\\nHarry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet,\\nbut Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that\\nhe’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the\\ncorridor.\\nHe had never had any money for candy with the\\nDursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with\\ngold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars\\nBars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have\\nMars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott’s\\nEvery Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum,\\nChocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes,\\nLicorice Wands, and a number of other strange things\\nHarry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss\\nanything, he got some of everything and paid the\\nwoman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the\\ncompartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.\\n“Hungry, are you?”\\n \\n“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a\\npumpkin pasty.\\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped\\nit. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one\\nof them apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t\\nlike corned beef.”\\n“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a\\npasty. “Go on — ”\\n“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She\\nhasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know,\\nwith five of us.”\\n“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had\\nanything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share\\nit with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron,\\neating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes,\\nand candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\\n“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a\\npack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are\\nthey?” He was starting to feel that nothing would\\nsurprise him.\\n“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing\\nAgrippa.”\\n“What?”\\n“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs\\nhave cards inside them, you know, to collect —\\nfamous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five\\nhundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”\\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up\\nthe card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon\\nglasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver\\n \\nhair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture\\nwas the name Albus Dumbledore.\\n“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.\\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said\\nRon. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks\\nHarry turned over his card and read:\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern\\ntimes, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his\\ndefeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the\\ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his\\nwork on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.\\nProfessor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten\\npin bowling.\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his\\nastonishment, that Dumbledore ’s face had\\ndisappeared.\\n“He’s gone!”\\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,”\\nsaid Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again\\nand I’ve got about six of her ... do you want it? You\\ncan start collecting.”\\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs\\nwaiting to be unwrapped.\\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the\\nMuggle world, people just stay put in photos.”\\n \\n“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded\\namazed. “Weird).”\\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the\\npicture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron\\nwas more interested in eating the frogs than looking\\nat the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry\\ncouldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only\\nDumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft,\\nAlberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He\\nfinally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna,\\nwho was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie\\nBott’s Every Flavor Beans.\\n“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned\\nHarry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every\\nflavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like\\nchocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then\\nyou can get spinach and liver and tripe. George\\nreckons he had a booger-flavored one once.”\\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully,\\nand bit into a corner.\\n“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.”\\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans.\\nHarry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry,\\ncurry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave\\nenough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron\\nwouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.\\nThe countryside now flying past the window was\\nbecoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there\\nwere woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.\\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment\\nand the round-faced boy Harry had passed on\\n \\nplatform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked\\ntearful.\\n“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”\\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost\\nhim! He keeps getting away from me!”\\n“Hell turn up,” said Harry.\\n“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him ...”\\nHe left.\\n“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d\\nbrought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind\\nyou, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.”\\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.\\n“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the\\ndifference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him\\nyellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but\\nthe spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look ...”\\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a\\nvery battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places\\nand something white was glinting at the end.\\n“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway — ”\\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment\\ndoor slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but\\nthis time he had a girl with him. She was already\\nwearing her new Hogwarts robes.\\n“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said.\\nShe had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown\\nhair, and rather large front teeth.\\n \\n“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron,\\nbut the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the\\nwand in his hand.\\n“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”\\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\\n“Er — all right.”\\nHe cleared his throat.\\n“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow,\\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”\\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers\\nstayed gray and fast asleep.\\n“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well,\\nit’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells\\njust for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in\\nmy family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise\\nwhen I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of\\ncourse, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft\\nthere is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books\\nby heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m\\nHermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”\\nShe said all this very fast.\\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his\\nstunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course\\nbooks by heart either.\\n“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.\\n“Harry Potter,” said Harry.\\n \\n“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about\\nyou, of course — I got a few extra books for\\nbackground reading, and you’re in Modern Magical\\nHistory and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and\\nGreat Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”\\n“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.\\n“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out\\neverything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do\\neither of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been\\nasking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds\\nby far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it,\\nbut I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. ...\\nAnyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad.\\nYou two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll\\nbe there soon.”\\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\\n“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said\\nRon. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid\\nspell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a\\ndud.”\\n“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.\\n“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling\\non him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t\\nknow what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose\\nRavenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put\\nme in Slytherin.”\\n“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was\\nin?”\\n“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat,\\nlooking depressed.\\n \\n“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are\\na bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off\\nHouses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that\\nthey’ve left, anyway?”\\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d\\nfinished school.\\n“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in\\nAfrica doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did\\nyou hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily\\nProphet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the\\nMuggles — someone tried to rob a high security\\nvault.”\\nHarry stared.\\n“Really? What happened to them?”\\n“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t\\nbeen caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful\\nDark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t\\nthink they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course,\\neveryone gets scared when something like this\\nhappens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.”\\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was\\nstarting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-\\nWho was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of\\nentering the magical world, but it had been a lot more\\ncomfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.\\n“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.\\n“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.\\n“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s\\nthe best game in the world — ” And he was off,\\nexplaining all about the four balls and the positions of\\n \\nthe seven players, describing famous games he’d been\\nto with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to\\nget if he had the money. He was just taking Harry\\nthrough the finer points of the game when the\\ncompartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t\\nNeville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this\\ntime.\\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle\\none at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s\\nrobe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more\\ninterest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.\\n“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train\\nthat Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is\\nit?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys.\\nBoth of them were thickset and looked extremely\\nmean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they\\nlooked like bodyguards.\\n“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale\\nboy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.\\n“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”\\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been\\nhiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.\\n“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who\\nyou are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red\\nhair, freckles, and more children than they can\\nafford.”\\nHe turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some\\nwizarding families are much better than others,\\nPotter. You don’t want to go making friends with the\\nwrong sort. I can help you there.”\\n \\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry\\ndidn’t take it.\\n“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself,\\nthanks,” he said coolly.\\nDraco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared\\nin his pale cheeks.\\n“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly.\\n“Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as\\nyour parents. They didn’t know what was good for\\nthem, either. You hang around with riffraff like the\\nWeasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.”\\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\\n“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\\n“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy\\nsneered.\\n“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely\\nthan he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot\\nbigger than him or Ron.\\n“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve\\neaten all our food and you still seem to have some.”\\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to\\nRon — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as\\ntouched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp\\nlittle teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe\\nand Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers\\nround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally\\nflew off and hit the window, all three of them\\ndisappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were\\n \\nmore rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps\\nthey’d heard footsteps, because a second later,\\nHermione Granger had come in.\\n“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the\\nsweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers\\nby his tail.\\n“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry.\\nHe looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it\\n— he’s gone back to sleep.”\\nAnd so he had.\\n“You’ve met Malfoy before?”\\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\\n“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were\\nsome of the first to come back to our side after You-\\nKnow-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched.\\nMy dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father\\ndidn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He\\nturned to Hermione. “Can we help you with\\nsomething?”\\n“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve\\njust been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he\\nsays we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting,\\nhave you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get\\nthere!”\\n“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron,\\nscowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while we\\nchange?”\\n“All right — I only came in here because people\\noutside are behaving very childishly, racing up and\\ndown the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice.\\n \\n“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you\\nknow?”\\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the\\nwindow. It was getting dark. He could see mountains\\nand forests under a deep purple sky. The train did\\nseem to be slowing down.\\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their\\nlong black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you\\ncould see his sneakers underneath them.\\nA voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching\\nHogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your\\nluggage on the train, it will be taken to the school\\nseparately.”\\nHarry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he\\nsaw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed\\ntheir pockets with the last of the sweets and joined\\nthe crowd thronging the corridor.\\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped.\\nPeople pushed their way toward the door and out on\\nto a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold\\nnight air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads\\nof the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice:\\n“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there,\\nHarry?”\\nHagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\\n“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer\\nstep, now! Firs’ years follow me!”\\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down\\nwhat seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so\\ndark on either side of them that Harry thought there\\nmust be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much.\\n \\nNeville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once\\nor twice.\\n“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid\\ncalled over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.”\\nThere was a loud “Oooooh!”\\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge\\nof a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain\\non the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry\\nsky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\\n“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to\\na fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore.\\nHarry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville\\nand Hermione.\\n“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to\\nhimself. “Right then — FORWARD!”\\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once,\\ngliding across the lake, which was as smooth as\\nglass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great\\ncastle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed\\nnearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\\n“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached\\nthe cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats\\ncarried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide\\nopening in the cliff face. They were carried along a\\ndark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right\\nunderneath the castle, until they reached a kind of\\nunderground harbor, where they clambered out onto\\nrocks and pebbles.\\n“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who\\nwas checking the boats as people climbed out of\\nthem.\\n \\n“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his\\nhands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the\\nrock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto\\nsmooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded\\naround the huge, oak front door.\\n“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”\\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times\\non the castle door.\\n \\n7\\nTHE SORTING HAT\\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired\\nwitch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a\\nvery stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this\\nwas not someone to cross.\\n“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.\\n“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”\\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so\\nbig you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’\\nhouse in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming\\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too\\nhigh to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase\\nfacing them led to the upper floors.\\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the\\nflagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of\\nhundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the\\nrest of the school must already be here — but\\nProfessor McGonagall showed the first years into a\\nsmall, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,\\n \\nstanding rather closer together than they would\\nusually have done, peering about nervously.\\n“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall.\\n“The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but\\nbefore you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will\\nbe sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very\\nimportant ceremony because, while you are here,\\nyour House will be something like your family within\\nHogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your\\nHouse, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free\\ntime in your House common room.\\n“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,\\nRavenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own\\nnoble history and each has produced outstanding\\nwitches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your\\ntriumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-\\nbreaking will lose House points. At the end of the\\nyear, the House with the most points is awarded the\\nHouse cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a\\ncredit to whichever House becomes yours.\\n“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few\\nminutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest\\nyou all smarten yourselves up as much as you can\\nwhile you are waiting.”\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak,\\nwhich was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s\\nsmudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his\\nhair.\\n“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”\\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\\n \\n“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked\\nRon.\\n“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but\\nI think he was joking.”\\nHarry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of\\nthe whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet\\n— what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t\\nexpected something like this the moment they\\narrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that\\neveryone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking\\nmuch except Hermione Granger, who was whispering\\nvery fast about all the spells she’d learned and\\nwondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not\\nto listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never,\\nnot even when he’d had to take a school report home\\nto the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his\\nteachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door.\\nAny second now, Professor McGonagall would come\\nback and lead him to his doom.\\nThen something happened that made him jump about\\na foot in the air — several people behind him\\nscreamed.\\n“What the — ?”\\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About\\ntwenty ghosts had just streamed through the back\\nwall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they\\nglided across the room talking to one another and\\nhardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be\\narguing. What looked like a fat little monk was\\nsaying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give\\nhim a second chance — ”\\n“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the\\nchances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and\\n \\nyou know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what\\nare you all doing here?”\\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly\\nnoticed the first years.\\nNobody answered.\\n“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at\\nthem. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?”\\nA few people nodded mutely.\\n“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old\\nHouse, you know.”\\n“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting\\nCeremony’s about to start.”\\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the\\nghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\\n“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first\\nyears, “and follow me.”\\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead,\\nHarry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with\\nRon behind him, and they walked out of the chamber,\\nback across the hall, and through a pair of double\\ndoors into the Great Hall.\\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and\\nsplendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands\\nof candles that were floating in midair over four long\\ntables, where the rest of the students were sitting.\\nThese tables were laid with glittering golden plates\\nand goblets. At the top of the hall was another long\\ntable where the teachers were sitting. Professor\\nMcGonagall led the first years up here, so that they\\n \\ncame to a halt in a line facing the other students,\\nwith the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces\\nstaring at them looked like pale lanterns in the\\nflickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among\\nthe students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to\\navoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and\\nsaw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard\\nHermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky\\noutside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.”\\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all,\\nand that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the\\nheavens.\\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor\\nMcGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front\\nof the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed\\nwizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and\\nextremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in\\nthe house.\\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry\\nthought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing —\\nnoticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at\\nthe hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there\\nwas complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip\\nnear the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the\\nhat began to sing:\\n“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,\\nBut don’t judge on what you see,\\nI’ll eat myself if you can find\\nA smarter hat than me.\\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\\n \\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\\nFor I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\\nAnd I can cap them all.\\nThere’s nothing hidden in your head\\nThe Sorting Hat can’t see,\\nSo try me on and I will tell you\\nWhere you ought to be.\\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry\\nSet Gryffindors apart;\\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\\nWhere they are just and loyal,\\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\\nAnd unafraid of toil;\\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\\nIf you’ve a ready mind,\\nWhere those of wit and learning,\\nWill always find their kind;\\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\\n \\nYou’ll make your real friends,\\nThose cunning folk use any means\\nTo achieve their ends.\\nSo put me on! Don’t be afraid l\\\\\\nAnd don’t get in a flap\\\\\\nYou’re in safe hands (though I have none)\\nFor I’m a Thinking Cap\\\\”\\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished\\nits song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then\\nbecame quite still again.\\n“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to\\nHarry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling\\na troll.”\\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot\\nbetter than having to do a spell, but he did wish they\\ncould have tried it on without everyone watching. The\\nhat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel\\nbrave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If\\nonly the hat had mentioned a House for people who\\nfelt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for\\nhim.\\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a\\nlong roll of parchment.\\n“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and\\nsit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott,\\nHannah!”\\n \\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of\\nline, put on the hat, which fell right down over her\\neyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause —\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.\\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as\\nHannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.\\nHarry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at\\nher.\\n“Bones, Susan!”\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan\\nscuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\\n“Boot, Terry!”\\n“RAVENCLAW!”\\nThe table second from the left clapped this time;\\nseveral Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with\\nTerry as he joined them.\\n“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but\\n“Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor,\\nand the table on the far left exploded with cheers;\\nHarry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.\\n“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin.\\nPerhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d\\nheard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked\\nlike an unpleasant lot.\\nHe was starting to feel definitely sick now. He\\nremembered being picked for teams during gym at his\\nold school. He had always been last to be chosen, not\\nbecause he was no good, but because no one wanted\\nDudley to think they liked him.\\n \\n“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”\\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the\\nHouse at once, but at others it took a little while to\\ndecide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy\\nnext to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a\\nwhole minute before the hat declared him a\\nGryffindor.\\n“Granger, Hermione!”\\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat\\neagerly on her head.\\n“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts\\nalways do when you’re very nervous. What if he\\nwasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with\\nthe hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor\\nMcGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had\\nobviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on\\nthe train?\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his\\ntoad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool.\\nThe hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When\\nit finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still\\nwearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter\\nto give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”\\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called\\nand got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched\\nhis head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”\\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle,\\nlooking pleased with himself.\\n \\nThere weren’t many people left now.\\n“Moon” , “Nott” ... , “Parkinson” ... , then a pair of\\ntwin girls, “Path” and “Path” ... , then “Perks, Sally-\\nAnne” . . . , and then, at last —\\n“Potter, Harry!”\\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke\\nout like little hissing fires all over the hall.\\n“ Potter , did she say?”\\n“ The Harry Potter?”\\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over\\nhis eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a\\ngood look at him. Next second he was looking at the\\nblack inside of the hat. He waited.\\n“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very\\ndifficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind\\neither. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a\\nnice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. ...\\nSo where shall I put you?”\\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not\\nSlytherin, not Slytherin.\\n“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you\\nsure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in\\nyour head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to\\ngreatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re\\nsure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”\\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole\\nhall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward\\nthe Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been\\nchosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed\\n \\nthat he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the\\nPrefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while\\nthe Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got\\nPotter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff\\nhe’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving\\nHarry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it\\ninto a bucket of ice-cold water.\\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end\\nnearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave\\nhim the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there,\\nin the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair,\\nsat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once\\nfrom the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on\\nthe train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing\\nin the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.\\nHarry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous\\nyoung man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking\\nvery peculiar in a large purple turban.\\nAnd now there were only four people left to be sorted.\\n“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron,\\njoined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,”\\nbecame a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He\\nwas pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers\\nunder the table and a second later the hat had\\nshouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”\\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed\\ninto the chair next to him.\\n“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley\\npompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was\\nmade a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her\\nscroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had\\nonly just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin\\npasties seemed ages ago.\\n \\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was\\nbeaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if\\nnothing could have pleased him more than to see\\nthem all there.\\n“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at\\nHogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like\\nto say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!\\nBlubber! Oddment! Tweak!\\n“Thank you!”\\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered.\\nHarry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.\\n“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.\\n“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard\\nin the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes,\\nHarry?”\\nHarry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him\\nwere now piled with food. He had never seen so many\\nthings he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast\\nchicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages,\\nbacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes,\\nfries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy,\\nketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint\\nhumbugs.\\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but\\nhe’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.\\nDudley had always taken anything that Harry really\\nwanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate\\nwith a bit of everything except the peppermints and\\nbegan to eat. It was all delicious.\\n“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly,\\nwatching Harry cut up his steak.\\n \\n“Can’t you — ?”\\n“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said\\nthe ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does\\nmiss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir\\nNicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service.\\nResident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”\\n“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My\\nbrothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless\\nNick!”\\n“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy\\n— ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus\\nFinnigan interrupted.\\n“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”\\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little\\nchat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.\\n“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and\\npulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell\\nonto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone\\nhad obviously tried to behead him, but not done it\\nproperly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on\\ntheir faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head\\nback onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new\\nGryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the\\nHouse Championship this year? Gryffindors have\\nnever gone so long without winning. Slytherins have\\ngot the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s\\nbecoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin\\nghost.”\\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a\\nhorrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a\\ngaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He\\nwas right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to\\n \\nsee, didn’t look too pleased with the seating\\narrangements.\\n“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus\\nwith great interest.\\n“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick\\ndelicately.\\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the\\nremains of the food faded from the plates, leaving\\nthem sparkling clean as before. A moment later the\\ndesserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor\\nyou could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate\\neclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-\\n0, rice pudding ...\\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk\\nturned to their families.\\n“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle.\\nMom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they\\nwere married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”\\nThe others laughed.\\n“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.\\n“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,”\\nsaid Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle\\nfor ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me\\noff my guard and force some magic out of me — he\\npushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly\\ndrowned — but nothing happened until I was eight.\\nGreat Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was\\nhanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles\\nwhen my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue\\nand he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the\\nway down the garden and into the road. They were all\\n \\nreally pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy.\\nAnd you should have seen their faces when I got in\\nhere — they thought I might not be magic enough to\\ncome, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he\\nbought me my toad.”\\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione\\nwere talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right\\naway, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly\\ninterested in Transfiguration, you know, turning\\nsomething into something else, of course, it’s\\nsupposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting\\nsmall, just matches into needles and that sort of\\nthing — ”).\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy,\\nlooked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was\\ndrinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall\\nwas talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor\\nQuirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a\\nteacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and\\nsallow skin.\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher\\nlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s\\neyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on\\nHarry’s forehead.\\n“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n“What is it?” asked Percy.\\n“N-nothing.”\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder\\nto shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the\\nteacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at\\nall.\\n \\n“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he\\nasked Percy.\\n“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder\\nhe’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He\\nteaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone\\nknows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot\\nabout the Dark Arts, Snape.”\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t\\nlook at him again.\\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor\\nDumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\\n“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all\\nfed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to\\ngive you.\\n“First years should note that the forest on the\\ngrounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our\\nolder students would do well to remember that as\\nwell.”\\nDumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction\\nof the Weasley twins.\\n“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to\\nremind you all that no magic should be used between\\nclasses in the corridors.\\n“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of\\nthe term. Anyone interested in playing for their House\\nteams should contact Madam Hooch.\\n“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-\\nfloor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds\\nto everyone who does not wish to die a very painful\\ndeath.”\\n \\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\\n“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.\\n“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s\\nodd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re\\nnot allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of\\ndangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he\\nmight have told us prefects, at least.”\\n“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school\\nsong!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other\\nteachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.\\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was\\ntrying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden\\nribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables\\nand twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\n“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore,\\n“and off we go!”\\nAnd the school bellowed:\\n“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\\nTeach us something please,\\nWhether we be old and bald\\nOr young with scabby knees,\\nOur heads could do with filling\\nWith some interesting stuff,\\nFor now they’re bare and full of air,\\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\\n \\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\\nBring back what we’ve forgot,\\nJust do your best, we’ll do the rest,\\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.”\\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last,\\nonly the Weasley twins were left singing along to a\\nvery slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their\\nlast few lines with his wand and when they had\\nfinished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\\n“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic\\nbeyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you\\ntrot!”\\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the\\nchattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the\\nmarble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again,\\nbut only because he was so tired and full of food. He\\nwas too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in\\nthe portraits along the corridors whispered and\\npointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them\\nthrough doorways hidden behind sliding panels and\\nhanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases,\\nyawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just\\nwondering how much farther they had to go when\\nthey came to a sudden halt.\\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair\\nahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them\\nthey started throwing themselves at him.\\n“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A\\npoltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show\\nyourself.”\\n \\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a\\nballoon, answered.\\n“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”\\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark\\neyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-\\nlegged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\\n“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle\\nFirsties! What fun!”\\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\\n“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I\\nmean it!” barked Percy.\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping\\nthe walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him\\nzooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\\n“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as\\nthey set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one\\nwho can control him, he won’t even listen to us\\nprefects. Here we are.”\\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a\\nvery fat woman in a pink silk dress.\\n“Password?” she said.\\n“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung\\nforward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all\\nscrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up —\\nand found themselves in the Gryffindor common\\nroom, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their\\ndormitory and the boys through another. At the top of\\n \\na spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the\\ntowers — they found their beds at last: five four-\\nposters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their\\ntrunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk\\nmuch, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\\n“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through\\nthe hangings. “Get off Scabbers! He’s chewing my\\nsheets.”\\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the\\ntreacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he\\nhad a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor\\nQuirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling\\nhim he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it\\nwas his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want\\nto be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried\\nto pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there\\nwas Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it —\\nthen Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher,\\nSnape, whose laugh became high and cold — there\\nwas a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating\\nand shaking.\\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he\\nwoke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all.\\n \\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\\n“There, look.”\\n“Where?”\\n“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”\\n“Wearing the glasses?”\\n“Did you see his face?”\\n“Did you see his scar?”\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his\\ndormitory the next day. People lining up outside\\nclassrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or\\ndoubled back to pass him in the corridors again,\\nstaring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was\\ntrying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at\\nHogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones;\\nsome that led somewhere different on a Friday; some\\n \\nwith a vanishing step halfway up that you had to\\nremember to jump. Then there were doors that\\nwouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled\\nthem in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t\\nreally doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It\\nwas also very hard to remember where anything was,\\nbecause it all seemed to move around a lot. The\\npeople in the portraits kept going to visit each other,\\nand Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\\nThe ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty\\nshock when one of them glided suddenly through a\\ndoor you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick\\nwas always happy to point new Gryffindors in the\\nright direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth\\ntwo locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him\\nwhen you were late for class. He would drop\\nwastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from\\nunder your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak\\nup behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech,\\n“GOT YOUR CONK!”\\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the\\ncaretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get\\non the wrong side of him on their very first morning.\\nFilch found them trying to force their way through a\\ndoor that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to\\nthe out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He\\nwouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were\\ntrying to break into it on purpose, and was\\nthreatening to lock them in the dungeons when they\\nwere rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-\\ncolored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like\\nFilch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule\\nin front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d\\nwhisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two\\nseconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of\\n \\nthe school better than anyone (except perhaps the\\nWeasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any\\nof the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was\\nthe dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a\\ngood kick.\\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there\\nwere the classes themselves. There was a lot more to\\nmagic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your\\nwand and saying a few funny words.\\nThey had to study the night skies through their\\ntelescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn\\nthe names of different stars and the movements of the\\nplanets. Three times a week they went out to the\\ngreenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology,\\nwith a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout,\\nwhere they learned how to take care of all the strange\\nplants and fungi, and found out what they were used\\nfor.\\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic,\\nwhich was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor\\nBinns had been very old indeed when he had fallen\\nasleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next\\nmorning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns\\ndroned on and on while they scribbled down names\\nand dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the\\nOddball mixed up.\\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny\\nlittle wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to\\nsee over his desk. At the start of their first class he\\ntook the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name\\nhe gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had\\nbeen quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to\\n \\ncross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking- to\\nthe moment they sat down in her first class.\\n“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and\\ndangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she\\nsaid. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave\\nand not come back. You have been warned.”\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again.\\nThey were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get\\nstarted, but soon realized they weren’t going to be\\nchanging the furniture into animals for a long time.\\nAfter taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each\\ngiven a match and started trying to turn it into a\\nneedle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione\\nGranger had made any difference to her match;\\nProfessor McGonagall showed the class how it had\\ngone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare\\nsmile.\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to\\nwas Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s\\nlessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom\\nsmelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to\\nward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was\\nafraid would be coming back to get him one of these\\ndays. His turban, he told them, had been given to him\\nby an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of\\na troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they\\nbelieved this story. For one thing, when Seamus\\nFinnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had\\nfought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started\\ntalking about the weather; for another, they had\\nnoticed that a funny smell hung around the turban,\\nand the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full\\nof garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected\\nwherever he went.\\n \\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t\\nmiles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come\\nfrom Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any\\nidea that they were witches and wizards. There was so\\nmuch to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have\\nmuch of a head start.\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They\\nfinally managed to find their way down to the Great\\nHall for breakfast without getting lost once.\\n“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he\\npoured sugar on his porridge.\\n“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron.\\n“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always\\nfavors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”\\n“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor\\nMcGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it\\nhadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of\\nhomework the day before.\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to\\nthis by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on\\nthe first morning, when about a hundred owls had\\nsuddenly streamed into the Great Hall during\\nbreakfast, circling the tables until they saw their\\nowners, and dropping letters and packages onto their\\nlaps.\\nHedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She\\nsometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of\\ntoast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the\\nother school owls. This morning, however, she\\nfluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar\\nbowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry\\ntore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\\n \\nDear Harry,\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like\\nto come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an\\nanswer back with Hedwig.\\nHagrid\\nHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see\\nyou later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off\\nagain.\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look\\nforward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to\\nbe the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the\\nidea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of\\nthe first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.\\nSnape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the\\ndungeons. It was colder here than up in the main\\ncastle, and would have been quite creepy enough\\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all\\naround the walls.\\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the\\nroll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.\\n“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new —\\ncelebrity.”\\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle\\nsniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling\\nthe names and looked up at the class. His eyes were\\nblack like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s\\n \\nwarmth. They were cold and empty and made you\\nthink of dark tunnels.\\n“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art\\nof potion-making,” he began. He spoke in barely more\\nthan a whisper, but they caught every word — like\\nProfessor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a\\nclass silent without effort. “As there is little foolish\\nwand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe\\nthis is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand\\nthe beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its\\nshimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that\\ncreep through human veins, bewitching the mind,\\nensnaring the senses. ... I can teach you how to bottle\\nfame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t\\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to\\nteach.”\\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and\\nRon exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione\\nGranger was on the edge of her seat and looked\\ndesperate to start proving that she wasn’t a\\ndunderhead.\\n“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I\\nadded powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of\\nwormwood?”\\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry\\nglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was;\\nHermione ’s hand had shot into the air.\\n“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry.\\nSnape ’s lips curled into a sneer.\\n“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”\\nHe ignored Hermione ’s hand.\\n \\n“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told\\nyou to find me a bezoar?”\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it\\nwould go without her leaving her seat, but Harry\\ndidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He\\ntried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who\\nwere shaking with laughter.\\n“I don’t know, sir.”\\n“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming,\\neh, Potter?”\\nHarry forced himself to keep looking straight into\\nthose cold eyes. He had looked through his books at\\nthe Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember\\neverything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and\\nFungi ?\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.\\n“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood\\nand wolfsbane?”\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching\\ntoward the dungeon ceiling.\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione\\ndoes, though, why don’t you try her?”\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye,\\nand Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not\\npleased.\\n“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your\\ninformation, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a\\nsleeping potion so powerful it is known as the\\nDraught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken\\n \\nfrom the stomach of a goat and it will save you from\\nmost poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they\\nare the same plant, which also goes by the name of\\naconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?”\\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and\\nparchment. Over the noise, Snape said, “And a point\\nwill be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek,\\nPotter.”\\nThings didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the\\nPotions lesson continued. Snape put them all into\\npairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to\\ncure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,\\nwatching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake\\nfangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy,\\nwhom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone\\nto look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his\\nhorned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a\\nloud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow\\nmanaged to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted\\nblob, and their potion was seeping across the stone\\nfloor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within\\nseconds, the whole class was standing on their stools\\nwhile Neville, who had been drenched in the potion\\nwhen the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as\\nangry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\\n“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion\\naway with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you\\nadded the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron\\noff the fire?”\\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over\\nhis nose.\\n“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at\\nSeamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who\\nhad been working next to Neville.\\n \\n“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add\\nthe quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got\\nit wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for\\nGryffindor.”\\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to\\nargue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\\n“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can\\nturn very nasty.”\\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour\\nlater, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were\\nlow. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very\\nfirst week — why did Snape hate him so much?\\n“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points\\noff Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid\\nwith you?”\\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way\\nacross the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden\\nhouse on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow\\nand a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling\\nfrom inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid ’s\\nvoice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.”\\nHagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he\\npulled the door open.\\n“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”\\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar\\nof an enormous black boarhound.\\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants\\nwere hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was\\n \\nboiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a\\nmassive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\\n“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of\\nFang, who bounded straight at Ron and started\\nlicking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as\\nfierce as he looked.\\n“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring\\nboiling water into a large teapot and putting rock\\ncakes onto a plate.\\n“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s\\nfreckles. “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers\\naway from the forest.”\\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins\\nthat almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron\\npretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all\\nabout their first lessons. Fang rested his head on\\nHarry’s knee and drooled all over his robes.\\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call\\nFilch “that old git.”\\n“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce\\nher to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up\\nter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get\\nrid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”\\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like\\nRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape\\nliked hardly any of the students.\\n“But he seemed to really hate me.”\\n“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”\\n \\nYet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t\\nquite meet his eyes when he said that.\\n“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I\\nliked him a lot — great with animals.”\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on\\npurpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s\\nwork with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper\\nthat was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was\\na cutting from the Daily Prophet :\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts\\non 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark\\nwizards or witches unknown.\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had\\nbeen taken. The vault that was searched had in fact\\nbeen emptied the same day.\\n“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep\\nyour noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said\\na Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that\\nsomeone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t\\nmentioned the date.\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in\\nhappened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening\\nwhile we were there!”\\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t\\nmeet Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered\\nhim another rock cake. Harry read the story again.\\nThe vault that was searched had in fact been emptied\\nearlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven\\n \\nhundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying,\\ntaking out that grubby little package. Had that been\\nwhat the thieves were looking for?\\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for\\ndinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes\\nthey’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that\\nnone of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as\\nmuch to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid\\ncollected that package just in time? Where was it\\nnow? And did Hagrid know something about Snape\\nthat he didn’t want to tell Harry?\\n \\n9\\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he\\nhated more than Dudley, but that was before he met\\nDraco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had\\nPotions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put\\nup with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until\\nthey spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor\\ncommon room that made them all groan. Flying\\nlessons would be starting on Thursday — and\\nGryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\\n“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always\\nwanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in\\nfront of Malfoy.”\\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more\\nthan anything else.\\n“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,”\\nsaid Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always\\ngoing on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet\\nthat’s all talk.”\\n \\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He\\ncomplained loudly about first years never getting on\\nthe House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful\\nstories that always seemed to end with him narrowly\\nescaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only\\none, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d\\nspent most of his childhood zooming around the\\ncountryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell\\nanyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a\\nhang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from\\nwizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.\\nRon had already had a big argument with Dean\\nThomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.\\nRon couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with\\nonly one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry\\nhad caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham\\nsoccer team, trying to make the players move.\\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life,\\nbecause his grandmother had never let him near one.\\nPrivately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because\\nNeville managed to have an extraordinary number of\\naccidents even with both feet on the ground.\\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about\\nflying as Neville was. This was something you couldn’t\\nlearn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t\\ntried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all\\nstupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library\\nbook called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was\\nhanging on to her every word, desperate for anything\\nthat might help him hang on to his broomstick later,\\nbut everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s\\nlecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\\nHarry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note,\\nsomething that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of\\ncourse. Malfoy ’s eagle owl was always bringing him\\n \\npackages of sweets from home, which he opened\\ngloatingly at the Slytherin table.\\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his\\ngrandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed\\nthem a glass ball the size of a large marble, which\\nseemed to be full of white smoke.\\n“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I\\nforget things — this tells you if there’s something\\nyou’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this\\nand if it turns red — oh ...” His face fell, because the\\nRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “... you’ve\\nforgotten something ...”\\nNeville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten\\nwhen Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor\\ntable, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half\\nhoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor\\nMcGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any\\nteacher in the school, was there in a flash.\\n“What’s going on?”\\n“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.”\\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall\\nback on the table.\\n“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with\\nCrabbe and Goyle behind him.\\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the\\nother Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto\\nthe grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear,\\nbreezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as\\nthey marched down the sloping lawns toward a\\n \\nsmooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds\\nto the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying\\ndarkly in the distance.\\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty\\nbroomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry\\nhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about\\nthe school brooms, saying that some of them started\\nto vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly\\nto the left.\\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short,\\ngray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\\n“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked.\\n“Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry\\nup.” \"\\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and\\nsome of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\\n“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called\\nMadam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ”\\n“UP!” everyone shouted.\\nHarry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it\\nwas one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had\\nsimply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t\\nmoved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell\\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a\\nquaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that\\nhe wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their\\nbrooms without sliding off the end, and walked up\\nand down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and\\nRon were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been\\ndoing it wrong for years.\\n \\n“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the\\nground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your\\nbrooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight\\nback down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle\\n— three — two — ”\\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of\\nbeing left on the ground, pushed off hard before the\\nwhistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.\\n“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising\\nstraight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve\\nfeet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face\\nlook down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,\\nslip sideways off the broom and —\\nWHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay\\nfacedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was\\nstill rising higher and higher, and started to drift\\nlazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as\\nwhite as his.\\n“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on,\\nboy — it’s all right, up you get.”\\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\\n“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the\\nhospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are\\nor you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say\\n‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”\\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist,\\nhobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm\\naround him.\\n \\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst\\ninto laughter.\\n“Did you see his face, the great lump?”\\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\\n“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.\\n“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy\\nParkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought\\nyou’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”\\n“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching\\nsomething out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing\\nLongbottom’s gran sent him.”\\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\\n“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone\\nstopped talking to watch.\\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\\n“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find\\n— how about — up a tree?”\\n“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto\\nhis broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he\\ncould fly well. Hovering level with the topmost\\nbranches of an oak he called, “Come and get it,\\nPotter!”\\nHarry grabbed his broom.\\n“iVo!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told\\nus not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.”\\n \\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears.\\nHe mounted the broom and kicked hard against the\\nground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his\\nhair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in\\na rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something\\nhe could do without being taught — this was easy,\\nthis was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a\\nlittle to take it even higher, and heard screams and\\ngasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring\\nwhoop from Ron.\\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in\\nmidair. Malfoy looked stunned.\\n“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that\\nbroom!”\\n“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking\\nworried.\\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward\\nand grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it\\nshot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got\\nout of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-\\nface and held the broom steady. A few people below\\nwere clapping.\\n“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck,\\nMalfoy,” Harry called.\\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\\n“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw\\nthe glass ball high into the air and streaked back\\ntoward the ground.\\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up\\nin the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward\\nand pointed his broom handle down — next second\\n \\nhe was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\\n— wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the\\nscreams of people watching — he stretched out his\\nhand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in\\ntime to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently\\nonto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in\\nhis fist.\\n“HARRY POTTER!”\\nHis heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor\\nMcGonagall was running toward them. He got to his\\nfeet, trembling.\\n“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ”\\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with\\nshock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare\\nyou — might have broken your neck — ”\\n“It wasn’t his fault, Professor — ”\\n“Be quiet, Miss Patil — ”\\n“But Malfoy — ”\\n“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.”\\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s\\ntriumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in\\nProfessor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the\\ncastle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it.\\nHe wanted to say something to defend himself, but\\nthere seemed to be something wrong with his voice.\\nProfessor McGonagall was sweeping along without\\neven looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now\\nhe’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be\\npacking his bags in ten minutes. What would the\\nDursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\\n \\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside,\\nand still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to\\nhim. She wrenched open doors and marched along\\ncorridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her.\\nMaybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He\\nthought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as\\ngamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant.\\nHis stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron\\nand the others becoming wizards while he stumped\\naround the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.\\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom.\\nShe opened the door and poked her head inside.\\n“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood\\nfor a moment?”\\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane\\nshe was going to use on him?\\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year\\nboy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking\\nconfused.\\n“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and\\nthey marched on up the corridor, Wood looking\\ncuriously at Harry.\\n“In here.”\\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom\\nthat was empty except for Peeves, who was busy\\nwriting rude words on the blackboard.\\n“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk\\ninto a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out\\ncursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door\\nbehind him and turned to face the two boys.\\n \\n“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a\\nSeeker.”\\nWood’s expression changed from puzzlement to\\ndelight.\\n“Are you serious, Professor?”\\n“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The\\nboy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was\\nthat your first time on a broomstick, Potter?”\\nHarry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was\\ngoing on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and\\nsome of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\\n“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot\\ndive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even\\nscratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done\\nit.”\\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had\\ncome true at once.\\n“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked\\nexcitedly.\\n“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor\\nMcGonagall explained.\\n“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now\\nwalking around Harry and staring at him. “Light —\\nspeedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom,\\nProfessor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a\\nCleansweep Seven, I’d say.”\\n“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we\\ncan’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need\\na better team than last year. Flattened in that last\\n \\nmatch by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in\\nthe face for weeks. ...”\\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses\\nat Harry.\\n“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may\\nchange my mind about punishing you.”\\nThen she suddenly smiled.\\n“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He\\nwas an excellent Quidditch player himself.”\\n“You’re joking.”\\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron\\nwhat had happened when he’d left the grounds with\\nProfessor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and\\nkidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all\\nabout it.\\n“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must\\nbe the youngest House player in about — ”\\n“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his\\nmouth. He felt particularly hungry after the\\nexcitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.”\\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and\\ngaped at Harry.\\n“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t\\ntell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.”\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall,\\nspotted Harry, and hurried over.\\n \\n“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us.\\nWe’re on the team too — Beaters.”\\n“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for\\nsure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since\\nCharlie left, but this year’s team is going to be\\nbrilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost\\nskipping when he told us.”\\n“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s\\nfound a new secret passageway out of the school.”\\n“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the\\nSmarmy that we found in our first week. See you.”\\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when\\nsomeone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked\\nby Crabbe and Goyle.\\n“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the\\ntrain back to the Muggles?”\\n“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the\\nground and you’ve got your little friends with you,”\\nsaid Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all\\nlittle about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table\\nwas full of teachers, neither of them could do more\\nthan crack their knuckles and scowl.\\n“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy.\\n“Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only —\\nno contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a\\nwizard’s duel before, I suppose?”\\n“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m\\nhis second, who’s yours?”\\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\\n \\n“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? Well meet you\\nin the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.”\\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each\\nother.\\n“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do\\nyou mean, you’re my second?”\\n“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said\\nRon casually, getting started at last on his cold pie.\\nCatching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly,\\n“But people only die in proper duels, you know, with\\nreal wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do\\nis send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows\\nenough magic to do any real damage. I bet he\\nexpected you to refuse, anyway.”\\n“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”\\n“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron\\nsuggested.\\n“Excuse me.”\\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\n“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.\\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\\n“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy\\nwere saying — ”\\n“Bet you could,” Ron muttered.\\n“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school\\nat night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if\\n \\nyou’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very\\nselfish of you.”\\n“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.\\n“Good-bye,” said Ron.\\nAll the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end\\nto the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later\\nlistening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville\\nwasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent\\nall evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to\\ncurse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t\\nremember how to block them.” There was a very good\\nchance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs.\\nNorris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck,\\nbreaking another school rule today. On the other\\nhand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of\\nthe darkness — this was his big chance to beat\\nMalfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.\\n“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better\\ngo.”\\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their\\nwands, and crept across the tower room, down the\\nspiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common\\nroom. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace,\\nturning all the armchairs into hunched black\\nshadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole\\nwhen a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I\\ncan’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.”\\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger,\\nwearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\\n“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!”\\n \\n“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped,\\n“Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.”\\nHarry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.\\n“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the\\nportrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.\\nHermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She\\nfollowed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at\\nthem like an angry goose.\\n“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care\\nabout yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the\\nHouse Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from\\nProfessor McGonagall for knowing about Switching\\nSpells.”\\n“Go away.”\\n“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what\\nI said when you’re on the train home tomorrow,\\nyou’re so — ”\\nBut what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione\\nhad turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back\\ninside and found herself facing an empty painting.\\nThe Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and\\nHermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.\\n“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.\\n“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go,\\nwe’re going to be late.”\\nThey hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor\\nwhen Hermione caught up with them.\\n“I’m coming with you,” she said.\\n \\n“You are not.”\\n“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for\\nFilch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell\\nhim the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you\\ncan back me up.”\\n“You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly.\\n“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard\\nsomething.”\\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\\n“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the\\ndark.\\nIt wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up\\non the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake\\nas they crept nearer.\\n“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for\\nhours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get\\nin to bed.”\\n“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig\\nsnout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone\\noff somewhere.”\\n“How’s your arm?” said Harry.\\n“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey\\nmended it in about a minute.”\\n“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be\\nsomewhere, we’ll see you later — ”\\n \\n“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet,\\n“I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s\\nbeen past twice already.”\\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at\\nHermione and Neville.\\n“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve\\nlearned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us\\nabout, and used it on you.”\\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron\\nexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry\\nhissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all\\nforward.\\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of\\nmoonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry\\nexpected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they\\nwere lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor\\nand tiptoed toward the trophy room.\\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal\\ntrophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught\\nthem. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver\\nand gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls,\\nkeeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the\\nroom. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in\\nand started at once. The minutes crept by.\\n“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.\\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump.\\nHarry had only just raised his wand when they heard\\nsomeone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.\\n“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a\\ncorner.”\\n \\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck,\\nHarry waved madly at the other three to follow him as\\nquickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the\\ndoor, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had\\nbarely whipped round the corner when they heard\\nFilch enter the trophy room.\\n“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter,\\n“probably hiding.”\\n“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and,\\npetrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full\\nof suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting\\nnearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak\\nand broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed Ron\\naround the waist, and the pair of them toppled right\\ninto a suit of armor.\\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the\\nwhole castle.\\n“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted\\ndown the gallery, not looking back to see whether\\nFilch was following — they swung around the\\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then\\nanother, Harry in the lead, without any idea where\\nthey were or where they were going — they ripped\\nthrough a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden\\npassageway, hurtled along it and came out near their\\nCharms classroom, which they knew was miles from\\nthe trophy room.\\n“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against\\nthe cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was\\nbent double, wheezing and spluttering.\\n“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the\\nstitch in her chest, “I — told — you.”\\n \\n“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron,\\n“quickly as possible.”\\n“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You\\nrealize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet\\nyou — Filch knew someone was going to be in the\\ntrophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”\\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t\\ngoing to tell her that.\\n“Let’s go.”\\nIt wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone\\nmore than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled\\nand something came shooting out of a classroom in\\nfront of them.\\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a\\nsqueal of delight.\\n“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown\\nout.”\\nPeeves cackled.\\n“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut,\\ntut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.”\\n“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”\\n“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity\\nvoice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your\\nown good, you know.”\\n“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at\\nPeeves — this was a big mistake.\\n \\n“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed,\\n“STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS\\nCORRIDOR!”\\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right\\nto the end of the corridor where they slammed into a\\ndoor — and it was locked.\\n“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at\\nthe door, “We’re done for! This is the end!”\\nThey could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he\\ncould toward Peeves ’s shouts.\\n“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed\\nHarry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered,\\n“Alohomora\\\\”\\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open — they\\npiled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their\\nears against it, listening.\\n“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying.\\n“Quick, tell me.”\\n“Say ‘please.’ ”\\n“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”\\n“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said\\nPeeves in his annoying singsong voice.\\n“All right — please.”\\n“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing\\nif you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they\\nheard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch\\ncursing in rage.\\n \\n“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I\\nthink well be okay — get off Neville!” For Neville had\\nbeen tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the\\nlast minute. “What?”\\nHarry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what.\\nFor a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a\\nnightmare — this was too much, on top of everything\\nthat had happened so far.\\nThey weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They\\nwere in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third\\nfloor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a\\nmonstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space\\nbetween ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three\\npairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and\\nquivering in their direction; three drooling mouths,\\nsaliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them,\\nand Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t\\nalready dead was that their sudden appearance had\\ntaken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over\\nthat, there was no mistaking what those thunderous\\ngrowls meant.\\nHarry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and\\ndeath, he’d take Filch.\\nThey fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut,\\nand they ran, they almost flew, back down the\\ncorridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them\\nsomewhere else, because they didn’t see him\\nanywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to\\ndo was put as much space as possible between them\\nand that monster. They didn’t stop running until they\\n \\nreached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh\\nfloor.\\n“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked,\\nlooking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders\\nand their flushed, sweaty faces.\\n“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted\\nHarry, and the portrait swung forward. They\\nscrambled into the common room and collapsed,\\ntrembling, into armchairs.\\nIt was a while before any of them said anything.\\nNeville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again.\\n“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing\\nlike that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If\\nany dog needs exercise, that one does.”\\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad\\ntemper back again.\\n“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she\\nsnapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on?”\\n“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its\\nfeet, I was too busy with its heads.”\\n“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s\\nobviously guarding something.”\\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\\n“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all\\nhave been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you\\ndon’t mind, I’m going to bed.”\\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\\n \\n“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged\\nher along, wouldn’t you?”\\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to\\nthink about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was\\nguarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said?\\nGringotts was the safest place in the world for\\nsomething you wanted to hide — except perhaps\\nHogwarts.\\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the\\ngrubby little package from vault seven hundred and\\nthirteen was.\\n \\n10\\nHALLOWEEN\\nMalfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that\\nHarry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day,\\nlooking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the\\nnext morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting\\nthe three-headed dog had been an excellent\\nadventure, and they were quite keen to have another\\none. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the\\npackage that seemed to have been moved from\\nGringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time\\nwondering what could possibly need such heavy\\nprotection.\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said\\nRon.\\n“Or both,” said Harry.\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious\\nobject was that it was about two inches long, they\\ndidn’t have much chance of guessing what it was\\nwithout further clues.\\n \\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest\\ninterest in what lay underneath the dog and the\\ntrapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near\\nthe dog again.\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and\\nRon, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they\\nsaw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted\\nnow was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their\\ngreat delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail\\nabout a week later.\\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual,\\neveryone’s attention was caught at once by a long,\\nthin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry\\nwas just as interested as everyone else to see what\\nwas in this large parcel, and was amazed when the\\nowls soared down and dropped it right in front of him,\\nknocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly\\nfluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a\\nletter on top of the parcel.\\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky,\\nbecause it said:\\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I\\ndon’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a\\nbroomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will\\nmeet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven\\no’clock for your first training session.\\nProfessor M. McGonagall\\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the\\nnote to Ron to read.\\n \\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously.\\n“I’ve never even touched one.”\\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the\\nbroomstick in private before their first class, but\\nhalfway across the entrance hall they found the way\\nupstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized\\nthe package from Harry and felt it.\\n“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to\\nHarry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.\\n“You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t\\nallowed them.”\\nRon couldn’t resist it.\\n“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus\\nTwo Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home,\\nMalfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry.\\n“Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same\\nleague as the Nimbus.”\\n“What would you know about it, Weasley, you\\ncouldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back.\\n“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up\\ntwig by twig.”\\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared\\nat Malfoy’s elbow.\\n“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.\\n“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said\\nMalfoy quickly.\\n“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick,\\nbeaming at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all\\nabout the special circumstances, Potter. And what\\nmodel is it?”\\n \\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting\\nnot to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face.\\n“And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,”\\nhe added.\\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their\\nlaughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion.\\n“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the\\ntop of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen\\nNeville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team. ...”\\n“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking\\nrules?” came an angry voice from just behind them.\\nHermione was stomping up the stairs, looking\\ndisapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.\\n“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.\\n“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so\\nmuch good.”\\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his\\nlessons that day. It kept wandering up to the\\ndormitory where his new broomstick was lying under\\nhis bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where\\nhe’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his\\ndinner that evening without noticing what he was\\neating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap\\nthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto\\nHarry’s bedspread.\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different\\nbrooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and\\nshiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of\\n \\nneat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand\\nwritten in gold near the top.\\nAs seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and\\nset off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d\\nnever been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of\\nseats were raised in stands around the field so that\\nthe spectators were high enough to see what was\\ngoing on. At either end of the field were three golden\\npoles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of\\nthe little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles\\nthrough, except that they were fifty feet high.\\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry\\nmounted his broomstick and kicked off from the\\nground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of\\nthe goal posts and then sped up and down the field.\\nThe Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he\\nwanted at his lightest touch.\\n“Hey, Potter, come down!”\\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large\\nwooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to\\nhim.\\n“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what\\nMcGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I’m\\njust going to teach you the rules this evening, then\\nyou’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”\\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized\\nballs.\\n“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to\\nunderstand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are\\nseven players on each side. Three of them are called\\nChasers.”\\n \\n“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a\\nbright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\\n“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The\\nChasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and\\nget it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten\\npoints every time the Quaffle goes through one of the\\nhoops. Follow me?”\\n“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through\\nthe hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of\\nlike basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t\\nit?”\\n“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.\\n“Never mind,” said Harry quickly.\\n“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called\\nthe Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly\\naround our hoops and stop the other team from\\nscoring.”\\n“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was\\ndetermined to remember it all. “And they play with\\nthe Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He\\npointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\n“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”\\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short\\nbaseball bat.\\n“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood\\nsaid. “These two are the Bludgers.”\\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and\\nslightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed\\n \\nthat they seemed to be straining to escape the straps\\nholding them inside the box.\\n“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and\\nfreed one of the Bludgers.\\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then\\npelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with\\nthe bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it\\nzigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their\\nheads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it\\nand managed to pin it to the ground.\\n“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger\\nback into the crate and strapping it down safely. “The\\nBludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off\\ntheir brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on\\neach team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their\\njob to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and\\nknock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve\\ngot all that?”\\n“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the\\nKeeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the\\nBludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off.\\n“Very good,” said Wood.\\n“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry\\nasked, hoping he sounded offhand.\\n“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken\\njaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last\\nmember of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And\\nyou don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the\\nBludgers — ”\\n“ — unless they crack my head open.”\\n \\n“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for\\nthe Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human\\nBludgers themselves.”\\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth\\nand last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the\\nBludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut.\\nIt was bright gold and had little fluttering silver\\nwings.\\n“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the\\nmost important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch\\nbecause it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the\\nSeeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out\\nof the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get\\nit before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever\\nSeeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra\\nhundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.\\nThat’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of\\nQuidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it\\ncan go on for ages — I think the record is three\\nmonths, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so\\nthe players could get some sleep.\\n“Well, that’s it — any questions?”\\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to\\ndo all right, it was doing it that was going to be the\\nproblem.\\n“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood,\\ncarefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too\\ndark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of\\nthese.”\\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket\\nand a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the\\nair, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could\\nin every direction for Harry to catch.\\n \\nHarry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was\\ndelighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen\\nand they couldn’t carry on.\\n“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,”\\nsaid Wood happily as they trudged back up to the\\ncastle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better\\nthan Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for\\nEngland if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what\\nwith Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top\\nof all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it\\nwhen he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts\\ntwo months. The castle felt more like home than\\nPrivet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming\\nmore and more interesting now that they had\\nmastered the basics.\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious\\nsmell of baking pumpkin wafting through the\\ncorridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced\\nin Charms that he thought they were ready to start\\nmaking objects fly, something they had all been dying\\nto try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom\\naround the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the\\nclass into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was\\nSeamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville\\nhad been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was\\nto be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to\\ntell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.\\nShe hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day\\nHarry’s broomstick had arrived.\\n“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve\\nbeen practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick,\\nperched on top of his pile of books as usual. “Swish\\nand flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the\\nmagic words properly is very important, too — never\\n \\nforget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f and\\nfound himself on the floor with a buffalo on his\\nchest.”\\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and\\nflicked, but the feather they were supposed to be\\nsending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got\\nso impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set\\nfire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat.\\nRon, at the next table, wasn’t having much more\\nluck.\\n“Wingardium Leviosal” he shouted, waving his long\\narms like a windmill.\\n“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap.\\n“It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and\\nlong.”\\n“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.\\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked\\nher wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’\\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four\\nfeet above their heads.\\n“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping.\\n“Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!”\\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\\n“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to\\nHarry as they pushed their way into the crowded\\ncorridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”\\n \\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past\\nhim. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her\\nface — and was startled to see that she was in tears.\\n“I think she heard you.”\\n“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.\\n“She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.”\\nHermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t\\nseen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great\\nHall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard\\nParvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione\\nwas crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be\\nleft alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but\\na moment later they had entered the Great Hall,\\nwhere the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of\\ntheir minds.\\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and\\nceiling while a thousand more swooped over the\\ntables in low black clouds, making the candles in the\\npumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on\\nthe golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term\\nbanquet.\\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato\\nwhen Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall,\\nhis turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone\\nstared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair,\\nslumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in\\nthe dungeons — thought you ought to know.”\\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple\\nfirecrackers exploding from the end of Professor\\nDumbledore’s wand to bring silence.\\n \\n“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the\\ndormitories immediately!”\\nPercy was in his element.\\n“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear\\nthe troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind\\nme, now. Make way, first years coming through!\\nExcuse me, I’m a prefect!”\\n“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they\\nclimbed the stairs.\\n“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,”\\nsaid Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween\\njoke.”\\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in\\ndifferent directions. As they jostled their way through\\na crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly\\ngrabbed Ron’s arm.\\n“I’ve just thought — Hermione.”\\n“What about her?”\\n“She doesn’t know about the troll.”\\nRon bit his lip.\\n“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not\\nsee us.”\\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the\\nother way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and\\nhurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They had just\\nturned the corner when they heard quick footsteps\\nbehind them.\\n \\n“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large\\nstone griffin.\\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but\\nSnape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from\\nview.\\n“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he\\ndown in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”\\n“Search me.”\\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor\\nafter Snape ’s fading footsteps.\\n“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron\\nheld up his hand.\\n“Can you smell something?”\\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a\\nmixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no\\none seems to clean.\\nAnd then they heard it — a low grunting, and the\\nshuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at\\nthe end of a passage to the left, something huge was\\nmoving toward them. They shrank into the shadows\\nand watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a\\ndull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder\\nwith its small bald head perched on top like a\\ncoconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with\\nflat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was\\nincredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which\\ndragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\\n \\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.\\nIt waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then\\nslouched slowly into the room.\\n“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could\\nlock it in.”\\n“Good idea,” said Ron nervously.\\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry,\\npraying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With\\none great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam\\nthe door, and lock it.\\n“Yes!”\\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back\\nup the passage, but as they reached the corner they\\nheard something that made their hearts stop — a\\nhigh, petrified scream — and it was coming from the\\nchamber they’d just chained up.\\n“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\\n“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.\\n“ Hermionel” they said together.\\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what\\nchoice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted\\nback to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their\\npanic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran\\ninside.\\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall\\nopposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll\\nwas advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the\\nwalls as it went.\\n \\n“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and,\\nseizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against\\nthe wall.\\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It\\nlumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had\\nmade the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It\\nhesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club\\nas it went.\\n“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the\\nchamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll\\ndidn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its\\nshoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again,\\nturning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving\\nHarry time to run around it.\\n“Come on, run, run\\\\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying\\nto pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move,\\nshe was still flat against the wall, her mouth open\\nwith terror.\\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the\\ntroll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron,\\nwho was nearest and had no way to escape.\\nHarry then did something that was both very brave\\nand very stupid: He took a great running jump and\\nmanaged to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck\\nfrom behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging\\nthere, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit\\nof wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been\\nin his hand when he’d jumped — it had gone straight\\nup one of the troll’s nostrils.\\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its\\nclub, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second,\\nthe troll was going to rip him off or catch him a\\nterrible blow with the club.\\n \\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled\\nout his own wand — not knowing what he was going\\nto do he heard himself cry the first spell that came\\ninto his head: “Wingardium Leviosal”\\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose\\nhigh, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and\\ndropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s\\nhead. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat\\non its face, with a thud that made the whole room\\ntremble.\\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of\\nbreath. Ron was standing there with his wand still\\nraised, staring at what he had done.\\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\\n“Is it — dead?”\\n“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been\\nknocked out.”\\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s\\nnose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray\\nglue.\\n“Urgh — troll boogers.”\\nHe wiped it on the troll’s trousers.\\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the\\nthree of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a\\nracket they had been making, but of course, someone\\ndownstairs must have heard the crashes and the\\ntroll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall\\nhad come bursting into the room, closely followed by\\nSnape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell\\n \\ntook one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and\\nsat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was\\nlooking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her\\nlook so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning\\nfifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s\\nmind.\\n“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor\\nMcGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked\\nat Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the\\nair. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you\\nin your dormitory?”\\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked\\nat the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\\n“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for\\nme.”\\n“Miss Granger!”\\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\\n“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I\\ncould deal with it on my own — you know, because\\nI’ve read all about them.”\\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a\\ndownright lie to a teacher?\\n“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry\\nstuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out\\nwith its own club. They didn’t have time to come and\\nfetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they\\narrived.”\\n \\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story\\nwasn’t new to them.\\n“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall,\\nstaring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you\\nfoolish girl, how could you think of tackling a\\nmountain troll on your own?”\\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless.\\nHermione was the last person to do anything against\\nthe rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to\\nget them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started\\nhanding out sweets.\\n“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from\\nGryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m\\nvery disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all,\\nyou’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are\\nfinishing the feast in their Houses.”\\nHermione left.\\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\\n“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first\\nyears could have taken on a full-grown mountain\\ntroll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor\\nDumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.”\\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at\\nall until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief\\nto be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from\\nanything else.\\n“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron\\ngrumbled.\\n“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione ’s.”\\n \\n“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron\\nadmitted. “Mind you, we did save her.”\\n“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t\\nlocked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him.\\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\\n“Pig snout,” they said and entered.\\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone\\nwas eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione,\\nhowever, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.\\nThere was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of\\nthem looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,”\\nand hurried off to get plates.\\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became\\ntheir friend. There are some things you can’t share\\nwithout ending up liking each other, and knocking\\nout a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\\n \\nQUIDDITCH\\nAs they entered November, the weather turned very\\ncold. The mountains around the school became icy\\ngray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the\\nground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen\\nfrom the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on\\nthe Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin\\novercoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin\\nboots.\\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry\\nwould be playing in his first match after weeks of\\ntraining: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor\\nwon, they would move up into second place in the\\nHouse Championship.\\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood\\nhad decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry\\nshould be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was\\nplaying Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry\\ndidn’t know which was worse — people telling him\\nhe’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be\\nrunning around underneath him holding a mattress.\\n \\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a\\nfriend. He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through\\nall his homework without her, what with all the last-\\nminute Quidditch practice Wood was making them\\ndo. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages,\\nwhich turned out to be a very interesting read.\\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of\\ncommitting a Quidditch foul and that all of them had\\nhappened during a World Cup match in 1473; that\\nSeekers were usually the smallest and fastest players,\\nand that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to\\nhappen to them; that although people rarely died\\nplaying Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish\\nand turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about\\nbreaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her\\nfrom the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for\\nit. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the\\nthree of them were out in the freezing courtyard\\nduring break, and she had conjured them up a bright\\nblue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.\\nThey were standing with their backs to it, getting\\nwarm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at\\nonce that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione moved closer together to block the fire from\\nview; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.\\nUnfortunately, something about their guilty faces\\ncaught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen\\nthe fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to\\ntell them off anyway.\\n“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?”\\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\\n \\n“Library books are not to be taken outside the\\nschool,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from\\nGryffindor.”\\n“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily\\nas Snape limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with\\nhis leg?”\\n“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron\\nbitterly.\\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that\\nevening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next\\nto a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s\\nCharms homework for them. She would never let\\nthem copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her\\nto read it through, they got the right answers anyway.\\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the\\nAges back, to take his mind off his nerves about\\ntomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting\\nup, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask\\nSnape if he could have it.\\n“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry\\nhad an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were\\nother teachers listening.\\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked.\\nThere was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.\\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was\\nworth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered\\ninside — and a horrible scene met his eyes.\\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was\\nholding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was\\nbloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape\\nbandages.\\n \\n“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you\\nsupposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at\\nonce?”\\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but —\\n“POTTER!”\\nSnape ’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his\\nrobes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.\\n“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”\\n“GET OUT! OUT!”\\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points\\nfrom Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.\\n“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them.\\n“What’s the matter?”\\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.\\n“You know what this means?” he finished\\nbreathlessly. “He tried to get past that three-headed\\ndog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we\\nsaw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d\\nbet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a\\ndiversion!”\\nHermione’s eyes were wide.\\n“No — he wouldn’t,” she said. “I know he’s not very\\nnice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something\\nDumbledore was keeping safe.”\\n“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints\\nor something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I\\n \\nwouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he\\nafter? What’s that dog guarding?”\\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the\\nsame question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry\\ncouldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he\\nneeded to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch\\nmatch in a few hours — but the expression on\\nSnape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy\\nto forget.\\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The\\nGreat Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried\\nsausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking\\nforward to a good Quidditch match.\\n“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.”\\n“I don’t want anything.”\\n“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.\\n“I’m not hungry.”\\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking\\nonto the field.\\n“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus\\nFinnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get\\nclobbered by the other team.”\\n“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile\\nketchup on his sausages.\\nBy eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out\\nin the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many\\nstudents had binoculars. The seats might be raised\\nhigh in the air, but it was still difficult to see what\\nwas going on sometimes.\\n \\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean\\nthe West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for\\nHarry, they had painted a large banner on one of the\\nsheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for\\nPresident, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had\\ndone a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then\\nHermione had performed a tricky little charm so that\\nthe paint flashed different colors.\\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of\\nthe team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch\\nrobes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .\\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\\n“Okay, men,” he said.\\n“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\\n“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”\\n“The big one,” said Fred Weasley.\\n“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.\\n“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry,\\n“we were on the team last year.”\\n“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team\\nGryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know\\nit.”\\nHe glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”\\n“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”\\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker\\nroom and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way,\\nwalked onto the field to loud cheers.\\n \\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the\\nmiddle of the field waiting for the two teams, her\\nbroom in her hand.\\n“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said,\\nonce they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed\\nthat she seemed to be speaking particularly to the\\nSlytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry\\nthought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in\\nhim. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering\\nbanner high above, flashing Potter for President over\\nthe crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\\n“Mount your brooms, please.”\\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They\\nwere off.\\n“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina\\nJohnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser\\nthat girl is, and rather attractive, too — ”\\n“JORDAN!”\\n“Sorry, Professor.”\\nThe Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the\\ncommentary for the match, closely watched by\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\n“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass\\nto Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last\\nyear only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the\\nSlytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain\\nMarcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint\\n \\nflying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc- no,\\nstopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper\\nWood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s\\nChaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive\\naround Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that\\nmust have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a\\nBludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s\\nAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but\\nhe’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by\\nFred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play\\nby the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back\\nin possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and\\noff she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding\\nBludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now,\\nAngelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses —\\nGRYFFINDORS SCORE!”\\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and\\nmoans from the Slytherins.\\n“Budge up there, move along.”\\n“Hagrid!”\\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid\\nenough space to join them.\\n“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a\\nlarge pair of binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t\\nthe same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch\\nyet, eh?”\\n“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.”\\n“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said\\nHagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at\\nthe speck that was Harry.\\n \\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game,\\nsquinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was\\npart of his and Wood’s game plan.\\n“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the\\nSnitch,” Wood had said. “We don’t want you attacked\\nbefore you have to be.”\\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple\\nof loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was\\nback to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught\\nsight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection\\nfrom one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a\\nBludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a\\ncannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and\\nFred Weasley came chasing after it.\\n“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he\\nbeat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.\\n“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying,\\n“Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys,\\nand Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a\\nmoment — was that the Snitch?”\\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey\\ndropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his\\nshoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left\\near.\\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived\\ndownward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker\\nTerence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they\\nhurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed\\nto have forgotten what they were supposed to be\\ndoing as they hung in midair to watch.\\n \\nHarry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little\\nround ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he\\nput on an extra spurt of speed —\\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors\\nbelow — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose,\\nand Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on\\nfor dear life.\\n“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors.\\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered\\na free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all\\nthe confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had\\ndisappeared from sight again.\\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send\\nhim off, ref! Red card!”\\n“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron.\\n“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get\\nshown the red card and you’re out of the game!”\\n“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him.\\nHagrid, however, was on Dean’s side.\\n“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked\\nHarry outta the air.”\\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\n“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of\\ncheating — ”\\n“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.\\n“I mean, after that open and revolting foul — ”\\n \\n“Jordan, I’m warning you — ”\\n“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor\\nSeeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a\\npenalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it\\naway, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor\\nstill in possession.”\\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went\\nspinning dangerously past his head, that it happened.\\nHis broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a\\nsplit second, he thought he was going to fall. He\\ngripped the broom tightly with both his hands and\\nknees. He’d never felt anything like that.\\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was\\ntrying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands\\ndid not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry\\ntried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts —\\nhe had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out —\\nand then he realized that his broom was completely\\nout of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t\\ndirect it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and\\nevery now and then making violent swishing\\nmovements that almost unseated him.\\nLee was still commentating.\\n“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle —\\npasses Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face\\nby a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking,\\nProfessor — Slytherins score — oh no ...”\\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have\\nnoticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It\\nwas carrying him slowly higher, away from the game,\\njerking and twitching as it went.\\n \\n“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid\\nmumbled. He stared through his binoculars. “If I\\ndidn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his\\nbroom ... but he can’t have. ...”\\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over\\nthe stands. His broom had started to roll over and\\nover, with him only just managing to hold on. Then\\nthe whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a\\nwild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling\\nfrom it, holding on with only one hand.\\n“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?”\\nSeamus whispered.\\n“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t\\nnothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful\\nDark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two\\nThousand.”\\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars,\\nbut instead of looking up at Harry, she started\\nlooking frantically at the crowd.\\n“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced.\\n“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.”\\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle\\nof the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on\\nHarry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.\\n“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said\\nHermione.\\n“What should we do?”\\n“Leave it to me.”\\n \\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had\\ndisappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on\\nHarry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost\\nimpossible for him to hang on much longer. The\\nwhole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the\\nWeasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one\\nof their brooms, but it was no good — every time they\\ngot near him, the broom would jump higher still. They\\ndropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously\\nhoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the\\nQuaffle and scored five times without anyone\\nnoticing.\\n“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.\\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand\\nwhere Snape stood, and was now racing along the row\\nbehind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she\\nknocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in\\nfront. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled\\nout her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen\\nwords. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto\\nthe hem of Snape ’s robes.\\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize\\nthat he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had\\ndone her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar\\nin her pocket, she scrambled back along the row —\\nSnape would never know what had happened.\\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able\\nto clamber back on to his broom.\\n“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been\\nsobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.\\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the\\ncrowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though\\n \\nhe was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours\\n— coughed — and something gold fell into his hand.\\n“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his\\nhead, and the game ended in complete confusion.\\n“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was\\nstill howling twenty minutes later, but it made no\\ndifference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee\\nJordan was still happily shouting the results —\\nGryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy\\npoints to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He\\nwas being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s\\nhut, with Ron and Hermione.\\n“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I\\nsaw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering,\\nhe wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of\\nwhat had gone on next to him in the stands. “Why\\nwould Snape do somethin’ like that?”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another,\\nwondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the\\ntruth.\\n“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid.\\n“He tried to get past that three-headed dog on\\nHalloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal\\nwhatever it’s guarding.”\\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\\n“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.\\n“ Fluffy ?”\\n \\n“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie\\nI met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore\\nto guard the — ”\\n“Yes?” said Harry eagerly.\\n“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly.\\n“That’s top secret, that is.”\\n“But Snape’s trying to steal it.”\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts\\nteacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.”\\n“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried\\nHermione.\\nThe afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have\\nchanged her mind about Snape.\\n“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all\\nabout them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and\\nSnape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!”\\n“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’\\nknow why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape\\nwouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all\\nthree of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’\\nconcern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’\\nyou forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor\\nDumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■”\\n“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas\\nFlamel involved, is there?”\\nHagrid looked furious with himself.\\n \\nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED\\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid-\\nDecember, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in\\nseveral feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the\\nWeasley twins were punished for bewitching several\\nsnowballs so that they followed Quirrell around,\\nbouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that\\nmanaged to battle their way through the stormy sky\\nto deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by\\nHagrid before they could fly off again.\\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the\\nGryffindor common room and the Great Hall had\\nroaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and\\na bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.\\nWorst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in\\nthe dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist\\nbefore them and they kept as close as possible to\\ntheir hot cauldrons.\\n“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions\\nclass, “for all those people who have to stay at\\n \\nHogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted\\nat home.”\\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and\\nGoyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out\\npowdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had\\nbeen even more unpleasant than usual since the\\nQuidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had\\nlost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a\\nwide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as\\nSeeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found\\nthis funny, because they were all so impressed at the\\nway Harry had managed to stay on his bucking\\nbroomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone\\nback to taunting Harry about having no proper\\nfamily.\\nIt was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet\\nDrive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come\\naround the week before, making a list of students\\nwho would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had\\nsigned up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at\\nall; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d\\never had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too,\\nbecause Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania\\nto visit Charlie.\\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions,\\nthey found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.\\nTwo enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a\\nloud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind\\nit.\\n“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his\\nhead through the branches.\\n“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”\\n \\n“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came\\nMalfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. “Are you trying\\nto earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be\\ngamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I\\nsuppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a\\npalace compared to what your family’s used to.”\\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\\n“WEASLEY!”\\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.\\n“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid,\\nsticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.\\n“Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”\\n“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules,\\nHagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from\\nGryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more.\\nMove along, all of you.”\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the\\ntree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.\\n“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s\\nback, “one of these days, I’ll get him — ”\\n“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”\\n“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said\\nHagrid. “Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the\\nGreat Hall, looks a treat.”\\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off\\nto the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and\\nProfessor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas\\ndecorations.\\n \\n“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner,\\nwould you?”\\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and\\nmistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than\\ntwelve towering Christmas trees stood around the\\nroom, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering\\nwith hundreds of candles.\\n“How many days you got left until yer holidays?”\\nHagrid asked.\\n“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me —\\nHarry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we\\nshould be in the library.”\\n“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes\\naway from Professor Flitwick, who had golden\\nbubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing\\nthem over the branches of the new tree.\\n“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the\\nhall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”\\n“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly.\\n“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been\\ntrying to find out who he is.”\\n“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here —\\nI’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that\\ndog’s guardin’.”\\n“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s\\nall,” said Hermione.\\n“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?”\\nHarry added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of\\nbooks already and we can’t find him anywhere — just\\n \\ngive us a hint — I know I’ve read his name\\nsomewhere.”\\n“I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly.\\n“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron,\\nand they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried\\noff to the library.\\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s\\nname ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how\\nelse were they going to find out what Snape was\\ntrying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to\\nknow where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might\\nhave done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t in\\nGreat Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable\\nMagical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from\\nImportant Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of\\nRecent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of\\ncourse, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of\\nthousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds\\nof narrow rows.\\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had\\ndecided to search while Ron strode off down a row of\\nbooks and started pulling them off the shelves at\\nrandom. Harry wandered over to the Restricted\\nSection. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel\\nwasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you\\nneeded a specially signed note from one of the\\nteachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he\\nknew he’d never get one. These were the books\\ncontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at\\nHogwarts, and only read by older students studying\\nadvanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\n“What are you looking for, boy?”\\n“Nothing,” said Harry.\\n \\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather\\nduster at him.\\n“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!”\\nWishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some\\nstory, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione\\nhad already agreed they’d better not ask Madam\\nPince where they could find Flamel. They were sure\\nshe’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk\\nSnape hearing what they were up to.\\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other\\ntwo had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful.\\nThey had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as\\nthey only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t\\nsurprising they’d found nothing. What they really\\nneeded was a nice long search without Madam Pince\\nbreathing down their necks.\\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him,\\nshaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\\n“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?”\\nsaid Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find\\nanything.”\\n“And you could ask your parents if they know who\\nFlamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.”\\n“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione.\\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were\\nhaving too good a time to think much about Flamel.\\nThey had the dormitory to themselves and the\\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so they\\nwere able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They\\nsat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a\\ntoasting fork — bread, English muffins,\\n \\nmarshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy\\nexpelled, which were fun to talk about even if they\\nwouldn’t work.\\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This\\nwas exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures\\nwere alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in\\nbattle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like\\neverything else he owned, it had once belonged to\\nsomeone else in his family — in this case, his\\ngrandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a\\ndrawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had\\ntrouble getting them to do what he wanted.\\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had\\nlent him, and they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a\\nvery good player yet and they kept shouting different\\nbits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t\\nsend me there, can’t you see his knight? Send him, we\\ncan afford to lose him.”\\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward\\nto the next day for the food and the fun, but not\\nexpecting any presents at all. When he woke early in\\nthe morning, however, the first thing he saw was a\\nsmall pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\\n“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry\\nscrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\\n“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got\\nsome presents!”\\n“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to\\nhis own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.\\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in\\nthick brown paper and scrawled across it was To\\nHarry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden\\n \\nflute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry\\nblew it — it sounded a bit like an owl.\\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas\\npresent. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped\\nto the note was a fifty-pence piece.\\n“That’s friendly,” said Harry.\\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\\n“ Weird\\\\ ” he said, “What a shape! This is money?”\\n“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how\\npleased Ron was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle —\\nso who sent these?”\\n“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron,\\nturning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy\\nparcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any\\npresents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you\\na Weasley sweater.”\\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-\\nknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of\\nhomemade fudge.\\n“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron,\\nunwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.”\\n“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the\\nfudge, which was very tasty.\\nHis next present also contained candy — a large box\\nof Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.\\n \\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt\\nit. It was very light. He unwrapped it.\\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the\\nfloor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\\n“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice,\\ndropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten\\nfrom Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is — they’re\\nreally rare, and really valuable.”\\n“What is it?”\\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It\\nwas strange to the touch, like water woven into\\nmaterial.\\n“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on\\nhis face. “I’m sure it is — try it on.”\\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron\\ngave a yell.\\n“It is! Look down!”\\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He\\ndashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection\\nlooked back at him, just his head suspended in\\nmidair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the\\ncloak over his head and his reflection vanished\\ncompletely.\\n“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of\\nit!”\\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter.\\nWritten in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen\\nbefore were the following words:\\n \\nYour father left this in my possession before he died. It\\nis time it was returned to you.\\nUse it well.\\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron\\nwas admiring the cloak.\\n“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,” he said. “Anuthinq.\\nWhat’s the matter?”\\n“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had\\nsent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his\\nfather?\\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the\\ndormitory door was flung open and Fred and George\\nWeasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly\\nout of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone\\nelse yet.\\n“Merry Christmas!”\\n“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”\\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one\\nwith a large yellow F on it, the other a G.\\n“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred,\\nholding up Harry’s sweater. “She obviously makes\\nmore of an effort if you’re not family.”\\n“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George\\ndemanded. “Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and\\nwarm.”\\n \\n“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he\\npulled it over his head.\\n“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed.\\n“I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But\\nwe’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and\\nForge.”\\n“What’s all this noise?”\\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door,\\nlooking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway\\nthrough unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a\\nlumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\\n“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all\\nwearing ours, even Harry got one.”\\n“I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins\\nforced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses\\naskew.\\n“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today,\\neither,” said George. “Christmas is a time for family.”\\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms\\npinned to his side by his sweater.\\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas\\ndinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of\\nroast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;\\ntureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich\\ngravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard\\ncrackers every few feet along the table. These\\nfantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble\\nMuggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their\\nlittle plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.\\nHarry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t\\njust bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and\\n \\nengulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from\\nthe inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several\\nlive, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore\\nhad swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered\\nbonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor\\nFlitwick had just read him.\\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey.\\nPercy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle\\nembedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting\\nredder and redder in the face as he called for more\\nwine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the\\ncheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and\\nblushed, her top hat lopsided.\\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down\\nwith a stack of things out of the crackers, including a\\npack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-\\nYour-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess\\nset. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a\\nnasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs.\\nNorris’s Christmas dinner.\\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon\\nhaving a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then,\\ncold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the\\nfire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry\\nbroke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to\\nRon. He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if\\nPercy hadn’t tried to help him so much.\\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle,\\nand Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy\\nto do much before bed except sit and watch Percy\\nchase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower\\nbecause they’d stolen his prefect badge.\\nIt had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet\\nsomething had been nagging at the back of his mind\\n \\nall day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to\\nthink about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had\\nsent it.\\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing\\nmysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon\\nas he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry\\nleaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the\\ncloak out from under it.\\nHis father’s ... this had been his father’s. He let the\\nmaterial flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light\\nas air. Use it well, the note had said.\\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and\\nwrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at\\nhis legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a\\nvery funny feeling.\\nUse it well.\\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of\\nHogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement\\nflooded through him as he stood there in the dark\\nand silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere,\\nand Filch would never know.\\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him?\\nSomething held him back — his father’s cloak — he\\nfelt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use\\nit alone.\\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across\\nthe common room, and climbed through the portrait\\nhole.\\n“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said\\nnothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.\\n \\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing,\\nand thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted\\nSection in the library. He’d be able to read as long as\\nhe liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel\\nwas. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight\\naround him as he walked.\\nThe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a\\nlamp to see his way along the rows of books. The\\nlamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and\\neven though Harry could feel his arm supporting it,\\nthe sight gave him the creeps.\\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the\\nlibrary. Stepping carefully over the rope that\\nseparated these books from the rest of the library, he\\nheld up his lamp to read the titles.\\nThey didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold\\nletters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t\\nunderstand. Some had no title at all. One book had a\\ndark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The\\nhairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he\\nwas imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint\\nwhispering was coming from the books, as though\\nthey knew someone was there who shouldn’t be.\\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down\\ncarefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom\\nshelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black\\nand silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out\\nwith difficulty, because it was very heavy, and,\\nbalancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence —\\nthe book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but\\nthe shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken,\\nearsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked\\nover his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he\\n \\nheard footsteps coming down the corridor outside —\\nstuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran\\nfor it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale,\\nwild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry\\nslipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked\\noff up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in\\nhis ears.\\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of\\narmor. He had been so busy getting away from the\\nlibrary, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was\\ngoing. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t\\nrecognize where he was at all. There was a suit of\\narmor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be\\nfive floors above there.\\n“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if\\nanyone was wandering around at night, and\\nsomebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.”\\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he\\nwas, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft,\\ngreasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it\\nwas Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well,\\nthey can’t be far, we’ll catch them.”\\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape\\ncame around the corner ahead. They couldn’t see\\nhim, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if\\nthey came much nearer they’d knock right into him —\\nthe cloak didn’t stop him from being solid.\\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood\\najar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed\\nthrough it, holding his breath, trying not to move it,\\nand to his relief he managed to get inside the room\\nwithout their noticing anything. They walked straight\\npast, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing\\ndeeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That\\n \\nhad been close, very close. It was a few seconds\\nbefore he noticed anything about the room he had\\nhidden in.\\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes\\nof desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and\\nthere was an upturned wastepaper basket — but\\npropped against the wall facing him was something\\nthat didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that\\nlooked as if someone had just put it there to keep it\\nout of the way.\\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling,\\nwith an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed\\nfeet. There was an inscription carved around the top:\\nErised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.\\nHis panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch\\nand Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror,\\nwanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.\\nHe stepped in front of it.\\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself\\nfrom screaming. He whirled around. His heart was\\npounding far more furiously than when the book had\\nscreamed — for he had seen not only himself in the\\nmirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right\\nbehind him.\\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he\\nturned slowly back to the mirror.\\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-\\nlooking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least\\nten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but still,\\nno one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was\\nhe in fact in a room full of invisible people and this\\nmirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or\\nnot?\\n \\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing\\nright behind his reflection was smiling at him and\\nwaving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind\\nhim. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their\\nreflections were so close together, but he felt only air\\n— she and the others existed only in the mirror.\\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair\\nand her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry\\nthought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright\\ngreen — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed\\nthat she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same\\ntime. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next\\nto her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and\\nhis hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just\\nas Harry’s did.\\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose\\nwas nearly touching that of his reflection.\\n“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”\\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry\\nlooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror,\\nand saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses\\nlike his, even a little old man who looked as though\\nhe had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was looking at\\nhis family, for the first time in his life.\\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared\\nhungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against\\nthe glass as though he was hoping to fall right\\nthrough it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of\\nache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\\nHow long he stood there, he didn’t know. The\\nreflections did not fade and he looked and looked\\nuntil a distant noise brought him back to his senses.\\nHe couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to\\n \\nbed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face,\\nwhispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the\\nroom.\\n“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.\\n“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show\\nyou the mirror.”\\n“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.\\n“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys,\\nyou’ll be able to show me your other brothers and\\neveryone.”\\n“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just\\ncome round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe\\nit only shows dead people. Shame about not finding\\nFlamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why\\naren’t you eating anything?”\\nHarry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and\\nwould be seeing them again tonight. He had almost\\nforgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very important\\nanymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was\\nguarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\\n“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”\\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be\\nable to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered\\nin the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly\\nthe next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from\\nthe library, wandering around the dark passageways\\nfor nearly an hour.\\n“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.”\\n“IVo!” Harry hissed. “I know it’s here somewhere.”\\n \\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the\\nopposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron\\nstarted moaning that his feet were dead with cold,\\nHarry spotted the suit of armor.\\n“It’s here — just here — yes!”\\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak\\nfrom around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.\\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the\\nsight of him.\\n“See?” Harry whispered.\\n“I can’t see anything.”\\n“Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...”\\n“I can only see you.”\\n“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”\\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the\\nmirror, he couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron\\nin his paisley pajamas.\\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\\n“Look at me!” he said.\\n“Can you see all your family standing around you?”\\n“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older —\\nand I’m Head Boy!”\\n“What?”\\n \\n“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and\\nI’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup —\\nI’m Quidditch captain, too!”\\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to\\nlook excitedly at Harry.\\n“Do you think this mirror shows the future?”\\n“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have\\nanother look — ”\\n“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit\\nmore time.”\\n“You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s\\ninteresting about that? I want to see my parents.”\\n“Don’t push me — ”\\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to\\ntheir discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they\\nhad been talking.\\n“Quick!”\\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous\\neyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and\\nHarry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing\\n— did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an\\nage, she turned and left.\\n“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet\\nshe heard us. Come on.”\\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\\nThe snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.\\n \\n“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.\\n“No.”\\n“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”\\n“No ... you go ...”\\n“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that\\nmirror. Don’t go back tonight.”\\n“Why not?”\\n“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and\\nanyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already.\\nFilch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around.\\nSo what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into\\nyou? What if you knock something over?”\\n“You sound like Hermione.”\\n“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”\\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which\\nwas to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t\\ngoing to stop him.\\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than\\nbefore. He was walking so fast he knew he was\\nmaking more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet\\nanyone.\\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him\\nagain, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily.\\nHarry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the\\nmirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying\\nhere all night with his family. Nothing at all.\\nExcept —\\n \\n“So — back again, Harry?”\\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He\\nlooked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the\\nwall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry\\nmust have walked straight past him, so desperate to\\nget to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.\\n“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”\\n“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make\\nyou,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see\\nthat he was smiling.\\n“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on\\nthe floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you,\\nhave discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.”\\n“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”\\n“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”\\n“It — well — it shows me my family — ”\\n“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”\\n“How did you know — ?”\\n“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said\\nDumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what the\\nMirror of Erised shows us all?”\\nHarry shook his head.\\n“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be\\nable to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror,\\nthat is, he would look into it and see himself exactly\\nas he is. Does that help?”\\n \\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us\\nwhat we want ... whatever we want ...”\\n“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us\\nnothing more or less than the deepest, most\\ndesperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never\\nknown your family, see them standing around you.\\nRonald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed\\nby his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best\\nof all of them. However, this mirror will give us\\nneither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away\\nbefore it, entranced by what they have seen, or been\\ndriven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or\\neven possible.\\n“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow,\\nHarry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If\\nyou ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It\\ndoes not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,\\nremember that. Now, why don’t you put that\\nadmirable cloak back on and get off to bed?”\\nHarry stood up.\\n“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you\\nsomething?”\\n“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled.\\n“You may ask me one more thing, however.”\\n“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”\\n“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”\\nHarry stared.\\n“One can never have enough socks,” said\\nDumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone\\n \\nand I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on\\ngiving me books.”\\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck\\nHarry that Dumbledore might not have been quite\\ntruthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved\\nScabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal\\nquestion.\\n \\nNICHOLAS FLAMBL\\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking\\nfor the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the\\nChristmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed\\nfolded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he\\ncould forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily,\\nbut he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over\\nand over again he dreamed about his parents\\ndisappearing in a flash of green light, while a high\\nvoice cackled with laughter.\\n“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could\\ndrive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about\\nthese dreams.\\nHermione, who came back the day before term\\nstarted, took a different view of things. She was torn\\nbetween horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed,\\nroaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had\\ncaught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at\\nleast found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\\n \\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel\\nin a library book, even though Harry was still sure\\nhe’d read the name somewhere. Once term had\\nstarted, they were back to skimming through books\\nfor ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even\\nless time than the other two, because Quidditch\\npractice had started again.\\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even\\nthe endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t\\ndampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that\\nWood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on\\nWood’s side. If they won their next match, against\\nHufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the\\nHouse Championship for the first time in seven years.\\nQuite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he\\nhad fewer nightmares when he was tired out after\\ntraining.\\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice\\nsession, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d\\njust gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept\\ndive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off\\ntheir brooms.\\n“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s\\nexactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match!\\nSnape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking for\\nany excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”\\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these\\nwords.\\n“ Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a\\nmouthful of mud. “When’s he ever refereed a\\nQuidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might\\novertake Slytherin.”\\n \\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to\\ncomplain, too.\\n“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make\\nsure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an\\nexcuse to pick on us.”\\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had\\nanother reason for not wanting Snape near him while\\nhe was playing Quidditch. ...\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another\\nas usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed\\nstraight back to the Gryffindor common room, where\\nhe found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was\\nthe only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry\\nand Ron thought was very good for her.\\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry\\nsat down next to him, “I need to concern” He caught\\nsight of Harry’s face. “What’s the matter with you?\\nYou look terrible.”\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear,\\nHarry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden,\\nsinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\n“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.\\n“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.\\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.\\n“ Really break your leg,” said Ron.\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I\\nback out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.”\\n \\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common\\nroom. How he had managed to climb through the\\nportrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs\\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at\\nonce as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to\\nbunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.\\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who\\nleapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville’s\\nlegs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.\\n“What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him\\nover to sit with Harry and Ron.\\n“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the\\nlibrary. He said he’d been looking for someone to\\npractice that on.”\\n“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged\\nNeville. “Report him!”\\nNeville shook his head.\\n“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled.\\n“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron.\\n“He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no\\nreason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.”\\n“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be\\nin Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville\\nchoked out.\\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a\\nChocolate Frog, the very last one from the box\\nHermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to\\nNeville, who looked as though he might cry.\\n \\n“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The\\nSorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And\\nwhere’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.”\\nNeville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he\\nunwrapped the frog.\\n“Thanks, Harry ... I think I’ll go to bed. ... D’you want\\nthe card, you collect them, don’t you?”\\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous\\nWizard card.\\n“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I\\never — ”\\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he\\nlooked up at Ron and Hermione.\\n“I’ve found him\\\\” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I\\ntold you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it\\non the train coming here — listen to this:\\n‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of\\nthe Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the\\ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his\\nwork on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’\\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so\\nexcited since they’d gotten back the marks for their\\nvery first piece of homework.\\n“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs\\nto the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had\\ntime to exchange mystified looks before she was\\ndashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\\n“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered\\nexcitedly. “I got this out of the library weeks ago for a\\nbit of light reading.”\\n \\n“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet\\nuntil she’d looked something up, and started flicking\\nfrantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\\n“I knew it! I knew it!”\\n“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily.\\nHermione ignored him.\\n“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the\\nonly known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\\\\”\\nThis didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.\\n“The what?” said Harry and Ron.\\n“Oh, honestly , don’t you two read? Look — read that,\\nthere.”\\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and\\nRon read:\\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with\\nmaking the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance\\nwith astonishing powers. The Stone will transform\\nany metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of\\nLife, which will make the drinker immortal.\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone\\nover the centuries, but the only Stone currently in\\nexistence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted\\nalchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated\\nhis six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year,\\nenjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle\\n(six hundred and fifty-eight).\\n \\n“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had\\nfinished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s\\nSorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep\\nit safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew\\nsomeone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone\\nmoved out of Gringotts!”\\n“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever\\ndying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it!\\nAnyone would want it.”\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study\\nof Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s\\nnot exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is\\nhe?”\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts,\\nwhile copying down different ways of treating werewolf\\nbites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d\\ndo with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t\\nuntil Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that\\nHarry remembered about Snape and the coming\\nmatch.\\n“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I\\ndon’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared\\nto face Snape. I’ll show them ... it’ll really wipe the\\nsmiles off their faces if we win.”\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,”\\nsaid Hermione.\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became\\nmore and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and\\nHermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm,\\neither. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House\\nChampionship was wonderful, no one had done it for\\nseven years, but would they be allowed to, with such\\na biased referee?\\n \\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not,\\nbut he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever\\nhe went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape\\nwas following him, trying to catch him on his own.\\nPotions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly\\ntorture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape\\npossibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s\\nStone? Harry didn’t see how he could — yet he\\nsometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could\\nread minds.\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck\\noutside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron\\nand Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever\\nsee him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call\\ncomforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep\\ntalk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked\\nup his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in\\nthe stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand\\nwhy they looked so grim and worried, or why they had\\nboth brought their wands to the match. Little did\\nHarry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly\\npracticing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the\\nidea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready\\nto use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to\\nhurt Harry.\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione\\nmuttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry\\naside.\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever\\nneed an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish\\n \\nthe game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too\\nmuch.”\\n“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley,\\npeering out of the door. “Even — blimey —\\nDumbledore’s come to watch!”\\nHarry’s heart did a somersault.\\n“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make\\nsure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that\\nsilver beard.\\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was\\nsafe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare\\nto try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.\\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as\\nthe teams marched onto the field, something that Ron\\nnoticed, too.\\n“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told\\nHermione. “Look — they’re off. Ouch!”\\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It\\nwas Malfoy.\\n“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.”\\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\\n“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom\\nthis time? Anyone want a bet? What about you,\\nWeasley?”\\nRon didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded\\nHufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit\\na Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers\\ncrossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry,\\n \\nwho was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the\\nSnitch.\\n“You know how I think they choose people for the\\nGryffindor team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes\\nlater, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty\\nfor no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for.\\nSee, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s\\nthe Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be\\non the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”\\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face\\nMalfoy.\\n“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but\\nRon, still not daring to take his eyes from the game,\\nsaid, “You tell him, Neville.”\\n“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than\\nWeasley, and that’s saying something.”\\nRon’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking\\npoint with anxiety about Harry.\\n“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ”\\n“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !”\\n“What? Where?”\\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive,\\nwhich drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.\\nHermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth,\\nas Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\\n“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted\\nsome money on the ground!” said Malfoy.\\n \\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was\\nhappening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to\\nthe ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the\\nback of his seat to help.\\n“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto\\nher seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape —\\nshe didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around\\nunder her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from\\nthe whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in\\ntime to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing\\nhim by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled\\nout of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch\\nclasped in his hand.\\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one\\ncould ever remember the Snitch being caught so\\nquickly.\\n“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s\\nwon! We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked\\nHermione, dancing up and down on her seat and\\nhugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground.\\nHe couldn’t believe it. He’d done it — the game was\\nover; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors\\ncame spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land\\nnearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt\\na hand on his shoulder and looked up into\\nDumbledore’s smiling face.\\n“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only\\nHarry could hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been\\nbrooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . .\\nexcellent ...”\\n \\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\\nJc Jc Jc\\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to\\ntake his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the\\nbroomshed. He couldn’t ever remember feeling\\nhappier. He’d really done something to be proud of\\nnow — no one could say he was just a famous name\\nany more. The evening air had never smelled so\\nsweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the\\nlast hour in his head, which was a happy blur:\\nGryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders;\\nRon and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and\\ndown, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the\\nwooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its\\nwindows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in\\nthe lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Snape. ...\\nAnd speaking of Snape . . .\\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of\\nthe castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked\\nas fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.\\nHarry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched.\\nHe recognized the figure’s prowling walk. Snape,\\nsneaking into the forest while everyone else was at\\ndinner — what was going on?\\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand\\nand took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw\\nSnape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\\nThe trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape\\nhad gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower,\\nbrushing the top branches of trees until he heard\\n \\nvoices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly\\nin a towering beech tree.\\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches,\\nholding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through\\nthe leaves.\\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he\\nwasn’t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t\\nmake out the look on his face, but he was stuttering\\nworse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they\\nwere saying.\\n\"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of\\nall p-places, Severus ...”\\n“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his\\nvoice icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about\\nthe Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.”\\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling\\nsomething. Snape interrupted him.\\n“Have you found out how to get past that beast of\\nHagrid’s yet?”\\n“B-b-but Severus, I — ”\\n“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said\\nSnape, taking a step toward him.\\n“I-I don’t know what you — ”\\n“You know perfectly well what I mean.”\\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the\\ntree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say,\\n“ — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.”\\n \\n“B-but I d-d-don’t — ”\\n“Very well,” Snape cut in. “Well have another little\\nchat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over\\nand decided where your loyalties lie.”\\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the\\nclearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see\\nQuirrell, standing quite still as though he was\\npetrified.\\nJc Jc Jc\\n“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.\\n“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping\\nHarry on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye,\\nand Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-\\nhanded! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says\\nhe’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin!\\nEveryone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re\\nhaving a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and\\nstuff from the kitchens.”\\n“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s\\nfind an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. ...”\\nHe made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting\\nthe door behind them, then he told them what he’d\\nseen and heard.\\n“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and\\nSnape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He\\nasked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said\\nsomething about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon\\nthere are other things guarding the stone apart from\\nFluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell\\n \\nwould have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that\\nSnape needs to break through — ”\\n“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell\\nstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.\\n“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.\\n \\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN\\nRIDGEBACK\\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d\\nthought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be\\ngetting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as though\\nhe’d cracked yet.\\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione would press their ears to the door\\nto check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape\\nwas sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which\\nsurely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever\\nHarry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an\\nencouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling\\npeople off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.\\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the\\nSorcerer’s Stone. She had started drawing up study\\nschedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and\\nRon wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging\\nthem to do the same.\\n \\n“Hermione, the exams are ages away.”\\n“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages,\\nthat’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.”\\n“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded\\nher. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already\\nknow it all.”\\n“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize\\nwe need to pass these exams to get into the second\\nyear? They’re very important, I should have started\\nstudying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into\\nme.”\\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking\\nalong the same lines as Hermione. They piled so\\nmuch homework on them that the Easter holidays\\nweren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It\\nwas hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting\\nthe twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand\\nmovements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron\\nspent most of their free time in the library with her,\\ntrying to get through all their extra work.\\n“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one\\nafternoon, throwing down his quill and looking\\nlongingly out of the library window. It was the first\\nreally fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a\\nclear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in\\nthe air of summer coming.\\nHarry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand\\nMagical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he\\nheard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doing in the\\nlibrary?”\\n \\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind\\nhis back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin\\novercoat.\\n“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their\\ninterest at once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He\\nlooked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin’ fer\\nNicolas Flamel, are yeh?”\\n“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron\\nimpressively. “And we know what that dog’s guarding,\\nit’s a Sorcerer’s St — ”\\n“Shhhh\\\\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if\\nanyone was listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it,\\nwhat’s the matter with yeh?”\\n“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a\\nmatter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding\\nthe Stone apart from Fluffy — ”\\n“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see\\nme later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind,\\nbut don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’\\ns’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ”\\n“See you later, then,” said Harry.\\nHagrid shuffled off.\\n“What was he hiding behind his back?” said\\nHermione thoughtfully.\\n“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?”\\n“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron,\\nwho’d had enough of working. He came back a\\nminute later with a pile of books in his arms and\\nslammed them down on the table.\\n \\n“Dragons\\'.” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff\\nabout dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great\\nBritain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon\\nKeeper’s Guide.”\\n“Hagrid ’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the\\nfirst time I ever met him,” said Harry.\\n“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon\\nbreeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention\\nof 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop\\nMuggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in\\nthe back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons,\\nit’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got\\noff wild ones in Romania.”\\n“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry.\\n“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh\\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic\\nhas a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind\\nhave to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted\\nthem, to make them forget.”\\n“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.\\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s\\nhut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all\\nthe curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?”\\nbefore he let them in, and then shut the door quickly\\nbehind them.\\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a\\nwarm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate.\\nHagrid made them tea and offered them stoat\\nsandwiches, which they refused.\\n“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?”\\n \\n“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around\\nthe bush. “We were wondering if you could tell us\\nwhat’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from\\nFluffy.”\\nHagrid frowned at him.\\n“O’ course I can’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know\\nmeself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I\\nwouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good\\nreason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I\\ns’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how\\nyeh even know abou’ Fluffy.”\\n“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us,\\nbut you do know, you know everything that goes on\\nround here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering\\nvoice. Hagrid ’s beard twitched and they could tell he\\nwas smiling. “We only wondered who had done the\\nguarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered\\nwho Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him,\\napart from you.”\\nHagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and\\nRon beamed at Hermione.\\n“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ...\\nlet’s see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some\\no’ the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout\\n— Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” he\\nticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell —\\nan’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course.\\nHang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor\\nSnape.”\\n“Snape?”\\n \\n“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look,\\nSnape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter\\nsteal it.”\\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the\\nsame as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting\\nthe Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the\\nother teachers had guarded it. He probably knew\\neverything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and\\nhow to get past Fluffy.\\n“You’re the only one who knows how to get past\\nFluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously.\\n“And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even\\none of the teachers?”\\n“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said\\nHagrid proudly.\\n“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the\\nothers. “Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m\\nboiling.”\\n“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him\\nglance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.\\n“Hagrid — what’s that?”\\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of\\nthe fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\\n“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard,\\n“That’s — er ...”\\n“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching\\nover the fire to get a closer look at the egg. “It must’ve\\ncost you a fortune.”\\n \\n“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the\\nvillage havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards\\nwith a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of\\nit, ter be honest.”\\n“But what are you going to do with it when it’s\\nhatched?” said Hermione.\\n“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling\\na large book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the\\nlibrary — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit —\\nit’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep\\nthe egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on\\n’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’\\nbrandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’\\nsee here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I\\ngot there’s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They’re rare,\\nthem.”\\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione\\ndidn’t.\\n“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.\\nBut Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily\\nas he stoked the fire.\\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what\\nmight happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was\\nhiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\\n“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron\\nsighed, as evening after evening they struggled\\nthrough all the extra homework they were getting.\\nHermione had now started making study schedules\\nfor Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\\n \\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry\\nanother note from Hagrid. He had written only two\\nwords: It’s hatching.\\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to\\nthe hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.\\n“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going\\nto see a dragon hatching?”\\n“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s\\nnothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone\\nfinds out what he’s doing — ”\\n“Shut up!” Harry whispered.\\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped\\ndead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t\\nlike the look on Malfoy’s face at all.\\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology\\nand in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to\\nHagrid’s with the other two during morning break.\\nWhen the bell sounded from the castle at the end of\\ntheir lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels\\nat once and hurried through the grounds to the edge\\nof the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed\\nand excited.\\n“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside.\\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep\\ncracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny\\nclicking noise was coming from it.\\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched\\nwith bated breath.\\n \\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg\\nsplit open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It\\nwasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a\\ncrumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge\\ncompared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout\\nwith wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging,\\norange eyes.\\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\\n“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached\\nout a hand to stroke the dragon’s head. It snapped at\\nhis fingers, showing pointed fangs.\\n“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid.\\n“Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian\\nRidgebacks grow, exactly?”\\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly\\ndrained from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to\\nthe window.\\n“What’s the matter?”\\n“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains\\n— it’s a kid — he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.”\\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a\\ndistance there was no mistaking him.\\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face\\nduring the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\nvery nervous. They spent most of their free time in\\nHagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\\n“Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.”\\n \\n“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.”\\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times\\nin length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its\\nnostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing his gamekeeping\\nduties because the dragon was keeping him so busy.\\nThere were empty brandy bottles and chicken\\nfeathers all over the floor.\\n“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking\\nat the dragon with misty eyes. “He really knows me\\nnow, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s Mommy?”\\n“He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.\\n“Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and\\nNorbert’s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy\\ncould go to Dumbledore at any moment.”\\nHagrid bit his lip.\\n“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’\\ndump him, can’t.”\\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron.\\n“Charlie,” he said.\\n“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?”\\n“No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania.\\nStudying dragons. We could send Norbert to him.\\nCharlie can take care of him and then put him back\\nin the wild!”\\n“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?”\\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send\\nan owl to Charlie to ask him.\\n \\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night\\nfound Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the\\ncommon room, long after everyone else had gone to\\nbed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight\\nwhen the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out\\nof nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak.\\nHe had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed\\nNorbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.\\n“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which\\nwas wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going\\nto be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that\\ndragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but\\nthe way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a\\nfluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off\\nfor frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a\\nlullaby.”\\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\\n“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll\\nhave Charlie’s answer!”\\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the\\nnote.\\nDear Ron,\\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to\\ntake the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy\\ngetting him here. I think the best thing will be to send\\nhim over with some friends of mine who are coming to\\nvisit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen\\ncarrying an illegal dragon.\\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at\\nmidnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and\\ntake him away while it’s still dark.\\n \\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.\\nLove,\\nCharlie\\nThey looked at one another.\\n“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It\\nshouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big\\nenough to cover two of us and Norbert.”\\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that\\nthe other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of\\nNorbert — and Malfoy.\\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten\\nhand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn’t\\nknow whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey —\\nwould she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon,\\nthough, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty\\nshade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were\\npoisonous.\\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing\\nat the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in\\nbed.\\n“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that\\nfeels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam\\nPomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he\\ncould come and have a good laugh at me. He kept\\nthreatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told\\nher it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I\\nshouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s\\nwhy he’s doing this.”\\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\\n \\n“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said\\nHermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the\\ncontrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\\n“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice.\\n“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s\\nletter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to\\nknow we’re getting rid of Norbert.”\\nHarry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer.\\nMadam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made\\nthem leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\\n“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told\\nHermione. “We haven’t got time to send Charlie\\nanother owl, and this could be our only chance to get\\nrid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got\\nthe Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about\\nthat.”\\nThey found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a\\nbandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who\\nopened a window to talk to them.\\n“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky\\nstage — nothin’ I can’t handle.”\\nWhen they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes\\nfilled with tears, although that might have been\\nbecause Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\\n“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’\\nplayin’ — he’s only a baby, after all.”\\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the\\nwindows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to\\nthe castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly\\nenough.\\n \\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time\\ncame for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn’t\\nbeen so worried about what they had to do. It was a\\nvery dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late\\narriving at Hagrid ’s hut because they’d had to wait for\\nPeeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall,\\nwhere he’d been playing tennis against the wall.\\nHagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\\n“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,”\\nsaid Hagrid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his\\nteddy bear in case he gets lonely.”\\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that\\nsounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his\\nhead torn off.\\n“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and\\nHermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak\\nand stepped underneath it themselves. “Mommy will\\nnever forget you!”\\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the\\ncastle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as\\nthey heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the\\nentrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up\\nanother staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s\\nshortcuts didn’t make the work much easier.\\n“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the\\ncorridor beneath the tallest tower.\\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them\\nalmost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were\\nalready invisible, they shrank into the shadows,\\nstaring at the dark outlines of two people grappling\\nwith each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\\n \\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair\\nnet, had Malfoy by the ear.\\n“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from\\nSlytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the\\nnight, how dare you — ”\\n“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s\\ncoming — he’s got a dragon!”\\n“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies!\\nCome on — I shall see Professor Snape about you,\\nMalfoy!”\\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower\\nseemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not\\nuntil they’d stepped out into the cold night air did\\nthey throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe\\nproperly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\\n“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”\\n“Don’t,” Harry advised her.\\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert\\nthrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later,\\nfour broomsticks came swooping down out of the\\ndarkness.\\nCharlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed\\nHarry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so\\nthey could suspend Norbert between them. They all\\nhelped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry\\nand Hermione shook hands with the others and\\nthanked them very much.\\nAt last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone.\\n \\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their\\nhearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was\\noff them. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention —\\nwhat could spoil their happiness?\\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the\\nstairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face\\nloomed suddenly out of the darkness.\\n“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.”\\nThey’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.\\n \\nTHE FORBIDDEN FOREST\\nThings couldn’t have been worse.\\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s\\nstudy on the first floor, where they sat and waited\\nwithout saying a word to each other. Hermione was\\ntrembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories\\nchased each other around Harry’s brain, each more\\nfeeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were\\ngoing to get out of trouble this time. They were\\ncornered. How could they have been so stupid as to\\nforget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that\\nProfessor McGonagall would accept for their being out\\nof bed and creeping around the school in the dead of\\nnight, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower,\\nwhich was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add\\nNorbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as\\nwell be packing their bags already.\\nHad Harry thought that things couldn’t have been\\nworse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall\\nappeared, she was leading Neville.\\n \\n“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the\\nother two. “I was trying to find you to warn you, I\\nheard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he\\nsaid you had a drag — ”\\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but\\nProfessor McGonagall had seen. She looked more\\nlikely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over\\nthe three of them.\\n“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch\\nsays you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one\\no’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.”\\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to\\nanswer a teacher’s question. She was staring at her\\nslippers, as still as a statue.\\n“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,”\\nsaid Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius\\nto work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-\\nbull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed\\nand into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose\\nyou think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the\\nstory and believed it, too?”\\nHarry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him\\nwithout words that this wasn’t true, because Neville\\nwas looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering\\nNeville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to\\ntry and find them in the dark, to warn them.\\n“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four\\nstudents out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of\\nsuch a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you\\nhad more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought\\nGryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of\\nyou will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr.\\nLongbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk\\n \\naround school at night, especially these days, it’s very\\ndangerous — and fifty points will be taken from\\nGryffindor.”\\n“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the\\nlead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.\\n“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall,\\nbreathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.\\n“Professor — please — ”\\n“You can’t—”\\n“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get\\nback to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed\\nof Gryffindor students.”\\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in\\nlast place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance\\nGryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as\\nthough the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.\\nHow could they ever make up for this?\\nHarry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville\\nsobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours.\\nHarry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort\\nhim. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the\\ndawn. What would happen when the rest of\\nGryffindor found out what they’d done?\\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses\\nthat recorded the House points the next day thought\\nthere ’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly\\nhave a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday?\\nAnd then the story started to spread: Harry Potter,\\nthe famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch\\nmatches, had lost them all those points, him and a\\ncouple of other stupid first years.\\n \\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired\\npeople at the school, Harry was suddenly the most\\nhated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on\\nhim, because everyone had been longing to see\\nSlytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry\\nwent, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their\\nvoices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other\\nhand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and\\ncheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”\\nOnly Ron stood by him.\\n“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George\\nhave lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been\\nhere, and people still like them.”\\n“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one\\ngo, though, have they?” said Harry miserably.\\n“Well — no,” Ron admitted.\\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry\\nswore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t\\nhis business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking\\naround and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that\\nhe went to Wood and offered to resign from the\\nQuidditch team.\\n“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do?\\nHow are we going to get any points back if we can’t\\nwin at Quidditch?”\\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the\\nteam wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if\\nthey had to speak about him, they called him “the\\nSeeker.”\\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t\\nhave as bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as\\n \\nwell-known, but nobody would speak to them, either.\\nHermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in\\nclass, keeping her head down and working in silence.\\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far\\naway. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off\\nhis misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to\\nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to\\nremember the ingredients in complicated potions,\\nlearn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates\\nof magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ...\\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to\\nstart, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in\\nanything that didn’t concern him was put to an\\nunexpected test. Walking back from the library on his\\nown one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering\\nfrom a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he\\nheard Quirrell’s voice.\\n“No — no — not again, please — ”\\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him.\\nHarry moved closer.\\n“All right — all right — ” he heard Quirrell sob.\\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the\\nclassroom straightening his turban. He was pale and\\nlooked as though he was about to cry. He strode out\\nof sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed\\nhim. He waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had\\ndisappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was\\nempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry\\nwas halfway toward it before he remembered what\\nhe’d promised himself about not meddling.\\nAll the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s\\nStones that Snape had just left the room, and from\\n \\nwhat Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking\\nwith a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to\\nhave given in at last.\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was\\ntesting Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d\\nheard.\\n“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told\\nhim how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell — ”\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him\\nwithout asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the\\nthousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a\\nbook somewhere in here telling you how to get past a\\ngiant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s\\neyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done\\nages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown\\nout for sure.”\\n“But we’ve got no proof.” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too\\nscared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he\\ndoesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and\\nthat he was nowhere near the third floor — who do\\nyou think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a\\nsecret we hate him, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it\\nup to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life\\ndepended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the\\nmore students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think.\\nAnd don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about\\nthe Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”\\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t.\\n \\n“If we just do a bit of poking around — ”\\n“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking\\naround.”\\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to\\nlearn the names of its moons.\\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry,\\nHermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They\\nwere all the same:\\nYour detention will take place at eleven o’clock\\ntonight.\\nMeet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\\nProfessor M. McGonagall\\nHarry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in\\nthe furor over the points they’d lost. He half expected\\nHermione to complain that this was a whole night of\\nstudying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry,\\nshe felt they deserved what they’d got.\\nAt eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron\\nin the common room and went down to the entrance\\nhall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so\\nwas Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had\\ngotten a detention, too.\\n“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading\\nthem outside.\\n“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule\\nagain, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh\\nyes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you\\nask me. ... It’s just a pity they let the old\\npunishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from\\n \\nthe ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in\\nmy office, keep ’em well oiled in case they’re ever\\nneeded. ... Right, off we go, and don’t think of running\\noff, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”\\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville\\nkept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment\\nwas going to be. It must be something really horrible,\\nor Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.\\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it\\nkept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry\\ncould see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then\\nthey heard a distant shout.\\n“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”\\nHarry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working\\nwith Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must\\nhave showed in his face, because Filch said, “I\\nsuppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with\\nthat oaf? Well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest\\nyou’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come\\nout in one piece.”\\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy\\nstopped dead in his tracks.\\n“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite\\nas cool as usual. “We can’t go in there at night —\\nthere’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I\\nheard.”\\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a\\nchoking noise.\\n“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice\\ncracking with glee. “Should’ve thought of them\\nwerewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?”\\n \\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark,\\nFang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow,\\nand a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\\n“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour\\nalready. All right, Harry, Hermione?”\\n“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said\\nFilch coldly, “they’re here to be punished, after all.”\\n“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at\\nFilch. “Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do\\nthat. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.”\\n“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of\\nthem,” he added nastily, and he turned and started\\nback toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the\\ndarkness.\\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid.\\n“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was\\npleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.\\n“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said\\nHagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got\\nter pay fer it.”\\n“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I\\nthought we’d be copying lines or something, if my\\nfather knew I was doing this, he’d — ”\\n“ — tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid\\ngrowled. “Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone?\\nYeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh think\\nyer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back\\noff ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!”\\n \\nMalfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but\\nthen dropped his gaze.\\n“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully,\\n’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’\\nI don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a\\nmoment.”\\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his\\nlamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding\\nearth track that disappeared into the thick black\\ntrees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked\\ninto the forest.\\n“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on\\nthe ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood.\\nThere’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.\\nThis is the second time in a week. I found one dead\\nlast Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor\\nthing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.”\\n“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us\\nfirst?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his\\nvoice.\\n“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh\\nif yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the\\npath. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties\\nan’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood\\nall over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around\\nsince last night at least.”\\n“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s\\nlong teeth.\\n“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid.\\n“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco,\\nNeville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us\\nfinds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right?\\n \\nGet yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s it — an’\\nif anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll\\nall come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”\\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it\\nthey reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry,\\nHermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy,\\nNeville, and Fang took the right.\\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground.\\nEvery now and then a ray of moonlight through the\\nbranches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the\\nfallen leaves.\\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\\n“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry\\nasked.\\n“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch\\na unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never\\nknew one ter be hurt before.”\\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could\\nhear running water; there must be a stream\\nsomewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn\\nblood here and there along the winding path.\\n“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’\\nworry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’\\nthen well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!”\\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them\\noff the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an\\narrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready\\nto fire. The three of them listened. Something was\\nslithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a\\ncloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting\\n \\nup the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound\\nfaded away.\\n“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here\\nthat shouldn’ be.”\\n“A werewolf?” Harry suggested.\\n“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn,\\nneither,” said Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but\\ncareful, now.”\\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the\\nfaintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead,\\nsomething definitely moved.\\n“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m\\narmed!”\\nAnd into the clearing came — was it a man, or a\\nhorse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard,\\nbut below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body\\nwith a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws\\ndropped.\\n“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are\\nyeh?”\\nHe walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.\\n“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a\\ndeep, sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?”\\n“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his\\ncrossbow. “There’s summat bad loose in this forest.\\nThis is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the\\nway. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan,\\nyou two. He’s a centaur.”\\n \\n“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.\\n“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And\\ndo you learn much, up at the school?”\\n“Erm — ”\\n“A bit,” said Hermione timidly.\\n“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He\\nflung back his head and stared at the sky. “Mars is\\nbright tonight.”\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad\\nwe’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn\\nbin hurt — you seen anythin’?”\\nRonan didn’t answer immediately. He stared\\nunblinkingly upward, then sighed again.\\n“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said.\\n“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.”\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’,\\nRonan? Anythin’ unusual?”\\n“Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while\\nHagrid watched him impatiently. “Unusually bright.”\\n“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit\\nnearer home,” said Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed\\nanythin’ strange?”\\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he\\nsaid, “The forest hides many secrets.”\\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid\\nraise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur,\\n \\nblack-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than\\nRonan.\\n“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?”\\n“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”\\n“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you\\nseen anythin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn\\nbin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?”\\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked\\nskyward.\\n“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply.\\n“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of\\nyou do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be\\noff, then.”\\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing,\\nstaring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until\\nthe trees blocked their view.\\n“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight\\nanswer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not\\ninterested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”\\n“Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.\\n“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves\\nmostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if\\never I want a word. They’re deep, mind, centaurs ...\\nthey know things ... jus’ don’ let on much.”\\n“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?”\\nsaid Harry.\\n \\n“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask\\nme, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never\\nheard anythin’ like it before.”\\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry\\nkept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the\\nnasty feeling they were being watched. He was very\\nglad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.\\nThey had just passed a bend in the path when\\nHermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm.\\n“Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!”\\n“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the\\npath, I’ll come back for yeh!”\\nThey heard him crashing away through the\\nundergrowth and stood looking at each other, very\\nscared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the\\nrustling of leaves around them.\\n“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?”\\nwhispered Hermione.\\n“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got\\nNeville ... it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.”\\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper\\nthan usual. Harry’s seemed to be picking up every\\nsigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going\\non? Where were the others?\\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s\\nreturn. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him.\\nHagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked\\nup behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville\\nhad panicked and sent up the sparks.\\n \\n“Well be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket\\nyou two were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups —\\nNeville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go\\nwith Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a\\nwhisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time\\nfrightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.”\\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with\\nMalfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an\\nhour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path\\nbecame almost impossible to follow because the trees\\nwere so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be\\ngetting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a\\ntree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing\\naround in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing\\nahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient\\noak.\\n“Look — ” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop\\nMalfoy.\\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground.\\nThey inched closer.\\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry\\nhad never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its\\nlong, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where\\nit had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on\\nthe dark leaves.\\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering\\nsound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on\\nthe edge of the clearing quivered. ... Then, out of the\\nshadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the\\nground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and\\nFang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the\\nunicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the\\nanimals side, and began to drink its blood.\\n \\n“AAAAAAAAAAARGH ! ”\\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did\\nFang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked\\nright at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its\\nfront. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry\\n— he couldn’t move for fear.\\nThen a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his\\nhead; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half\\nblinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves\\nbehind him, galloping, and something jumped clean\\nover Harry, charging at the figure.\\nThe pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his\\nknees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he\\nlooked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was\\nstanding over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one\\nlooked younger; he had white-blond hair and a\\npalomino body.\\n“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to\\nhis feet.\\n“Yes — thank you — what was that?”\\nThe centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue\\neyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at\\nHarry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out,\\nlivid, on Harry’s forehead.\\n“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get\\nback to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time —\\nespecially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker\\nthis way.\\n“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered\\nhimself on to his front legs so that Harry could\\nclamber onto his back.\\n \\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from\\nthe other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came\\nbursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and\\nsweaty.\\n“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You\\nhave a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are\\nyou a common mule?”\\n“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the\\nPotter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the\\nbetter.”\\n“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane.\\n“Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set\\nourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what\\nis to come in the movements of the planets?”\\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze\\nthought he was acting for the best,” he said in his\\ngloomy voice.\\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\\n“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs\\nare concerned with what has been foretold! It is not\\nour business to run around like donkeys after stray\\nhumans in our forest!”\\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger,\\nso that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\\n“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at\\nBane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or\\nhave the planets not let you in on that secret? I set\\nmyself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane,\\nyes, with humans alongside me if I must.”\\n \\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on\\nas best he could, they plunged off into the trees,\\nleaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\\nHarry didn’t have a clue what was going on.\\n“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that\\nthing you saved me from, anyway?”\\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his\\nhead bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did\\nnot answer Harry’s question. They made their way\\nthrough the trees in silence for so long that Harry\\nthought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore.\\nThey were passing through a particularly dense patch\\nof trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\\n“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is\\nused for?”\\n“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve\\nonly used the horn and tail hair in Potions.”\\n“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a\\nunicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to\\nlose, and everything to gain, would commit such a\\ncrime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even\\nif you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price.\\nYou have slain something pure and defenseless to\\nsave yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a\\ncursed life, from the moment the blood touches your\\nlips.”\\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was\\ndappled silver in the moonlight.\\n“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If\\nyou’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t\\nit?”\\n \\n“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay\\nalive long enough to drink something else —\\nsomething that will bring you back to full strength\\nand power — something that will mean you can never\\ndie. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the\\nschool at this very moment?”\\n“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life!\\nBut I don’t understand who — ”\\n“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years\\nto return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting\\ntheir chance?”\\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly\\naround Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees,\\nhe seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told\\nhim on the night they had met: “Some say he died.\\nCodswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough\\nhuman left in him to die.”\\n“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was VoZ — ”\\n“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\\nHermione was running toward them down the path,\\nHagrid puffing along behind her.\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was\\nsaying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that\\nclearing back there.”\\n“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as\\nHagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are\\nsafe now.”\\nHarry slid off his back.\\n \\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets\\nhave been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs.\\nI hope this is one of those times.”\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the\\nforest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room,\\nwaiting for them to return. He shouted something\\nabout Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him\\nawake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-\\neyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what\\nhad happened in the forest.\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in\\nfront of the fire. He was still shaking.\\n“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ... and\\nVoldemort’s waiting in the forest ... and all this time\\nwe thought Snape just wanted to get rich. ...”\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified\\nwhisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\\nHarry wasn’t listening.\\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. ...\\nBane was furious ... he was talking about interfering\\nwith what the planets say is going to happen. ... They\\nmust show that Voldemort’s coming back. ... Bane\\nthinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. ... I\\nsuppose that’s written in the stars as well.”\\n“Will you stop saying the name\\\\” Ron hissed.\\n“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the\\nStone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will\\nbe able to come and finish me off. ... Well, I suppose\\nBane 11 be happy.”\\n \\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word\\nof comfort.\\n“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one\\nYou-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore\\naround, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway,\\nwho says the centaurs are right? It sounds like\\nfortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says\\nthat’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”\\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking.\\nThey went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But\\nthe night’s surprises weren’t over.\\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his\\nInvisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them.\\nThere was a note pinned to it:\\nJust in case.\\n \\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember\\nhow he had managed to get through his exams when\\nhe half expected Voldemort to come bursting through\\nthe door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and\\nthere could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and\\nwell behind the locked door.\\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large\\nclassroom where they did their written papers. They\\nhad been given special, new quills for the exams,\\nwhich had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating\\nspell.\\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick\\ncalled them one by one into his class to see if they\\ncould make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk.\\nProfessor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse\\ninto a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the\\nsnuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers.\\nSnape made them all nervous, breathing down their\\nnecks while they tried to remember how to make a\\nForgetfulness potion.\\n \\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the\\nstabbing pains in his forehead, which had been\\nbothering him ever since his trip into the forest.\\nNeville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves\\nbecause Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that\\nHarry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except\\nthat it was now worse than ever because there was a\\nhooded figure dripping blood in it.\\nMaybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry\\nhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have\\nscars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and\\nHermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as\\nHarry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them,\\nbut he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they\\nwere so busy with their studying they didn’t have\\nmuch time to fret about what Snape or anyone else\\nmight be up to.\\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour\\nof answering questions about batty old wizards who’d\\ninvented self-stirring cauldrons and they’d be free,\\nfree for a whole wonderful week until their exam\\nresults came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns\\ntold them to put down their quills and roll up their\\nparchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the\\nrest.\\n“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said\\nHermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto\\nthe sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the\\n1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of\\nElfric the Eager.”\\nHermione always liked to go through their exam\\npapers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill,\\nso they wandered down to the lake and flopped under\\na tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were\\n \\ntickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was\\nbasking in the warm shallows.\\n“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching\\nout on the grass. “You could look more cheerful,\\nHarry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly\\nwe’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.”\\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\\n“I wish I knew what this means\\\\” he burst out angrily.\\n“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but\\nnever as often as this.”\\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.\\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning ... it\\nmeans danger’s coming. ...”\\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n“Harry, relax, Hermione ’s right, the Stone’s safe as\\nlong as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never\\nhad any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy.\\nHe nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to\\ntry it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch\\nfor England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking\\nfeeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do,\\nsomething important. When he tried to explain this,\\nHermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last\\nnight and was halfway through my Transfiguration\\nnotes before I remembered we’d done that one.”\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have\\nanything to do with work, though. He watched an owl\\nflutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a\\nnote clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one\\n \\nwho ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray\\nDumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to\\nget past Fluffy . . . never . . . but —\\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.\\n“Where ’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.\\n“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had\\nturned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”\\n“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry,\\nscrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid\\nwants more than anything else is a dragon, and a\\nstranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in\\nhis pocket? How many people wander around with\\ndragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they\\nfound Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it\\nbefore?”\\n“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry,\\nsprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t\\nanswer.\\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house;\\nhis trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was\\nshelling peas into a large bowl.\\n“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got\\ntime fer a drink?”\\n“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\\n“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you\\nsomething. You know that night you won Norbert?\\nWhat did the stranger you were playing cards with\\nlook like?”\\n \\n“Dunno said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his\\ncloak off.”\\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his\\neyebrows.\\n“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in\\nthe Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the\\nvillage. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I\\nnever saw his face, he kept his hood up.”\\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas.\\n“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you\\nmention Hogwarts at all?”\\n“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried\\nto remember. “Yeah ... he asked what I did, an’ I told\\nhim I was gamekeeper here. ... He asked a bit about\\nthe sorta creatures I look after ... so I told him ... an’ I\\nsaid what I’d always really wanted was a dragon ...\\nan’ then ... I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept\\nbuyin’ me drinks. ... Let’s see ... yeah, then he said he\\nhad the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I\\nwanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he\\ndidn’ want it ter go ter any old home. ... So I told him,\\nafter Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...”\\n“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?”\\nHarry asked, trying to keep his voice calm.\\n“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh\\nmeet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a\\npiece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’\\nplay him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter\\nsleep — ”\\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\\n \\n“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I\\nsaid it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other\\nat all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall,\\nwhich seemed very cold and gloomy after the\\ngrounds.\\n“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid\\ntold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was\\neither Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it\\nmust’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just\\nhope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us\\nup if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s\\noffice?”\\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign\\npointing them in the right direction. They had never\\nbeen told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know\\nanyone who had been sent to see him.\\n“Well just have to — ” Harry began, but a voice\\nsuddenly rang across the hall.\\n“What are you three doing inside?”\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of\\nbooks.\\n“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said\\nHermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\\n“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall\\nrepeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to\\nwant to do. “Why?”\\nHarry swallowed — now what?\\n \\n“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he\\nhadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils\\nflared.\\n“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said\\ncoldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry\\nof Magic and flew off for London at once.”\\n“He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?”\\n“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter,\\nhe has many demands on his time — ”\\n“But this is important.”\\n“Something you have to say is more important than\\nthe Ministry of Magic, Potter?”\\n“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds,\\n“Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ”\\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it\\nwasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out\\nof her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.\\n“How do you know — ?” she spluttered.\\n“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that\\nsomeone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to\\ntalk to Professor Dumbledore.”\\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\\n“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she\\nsaid finally. “I don’t know how you found out about\\nthe Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal\\nit, it’s too well protected.”\\n“But Professor — ”\\n \\n“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said\\nshortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen\\nbooks. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy\\nthe sunshine.”\\nBut they didn’t.\\n“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor\\nMcGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going\\nthrough the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out\\neverything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore\\nout of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of\\nMagic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns\\nup.”\\n“But what can we — ”\\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\\nSnape was standing there.\\n“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.\\nThey stared at him.\\n“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said,\\nwith an odd, twisted smile.\\n“We were — ” Harry began, without any idea what he\\nwas going to say.\\n“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging\\naround like this, people will think you’re up to\\nsomething. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose\\nany more points, can it?”\\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape\\ncalled them back.\\n \\n“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings\\nand I will personally make sure you are expelled.\\nGood day to you.”\\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\\n“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered\\nurgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape\\n— wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he\\nleaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”\\n“Why me?”\\n“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be\\nwaiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a\\nhigh voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I\\nthink I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ’ ”\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go\\nand watch out for Snape.\\n“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,”\\nHarry told Ron. “Come on.”\\nBut that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had\\nthey reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest\\nof the school than Professor McGonagall turned up\\nagain and this time, she lost her temper.\\n“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a\\npack of enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this\\nnonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here\\nagain, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor!\\nYes, Weasley, from my own House!”\\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry\\nhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,”\\n \\nwhen the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and\\nHermione came in.\\n“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and\\nasked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for\\nFlitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only\\njust got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”\\n“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.\\nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes\\nwere glittering.\\n“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and\\nget to the Stone first.”\\n“You’re mad!” said Ron.\\n“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall\\nand Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!”\\n“SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand?\\nIf Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming\\nback! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was\\ntrying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to\\nget expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a\\nschool for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter\\nanymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you\\nand your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House\\nCup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well,\\nI’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for\\nVoldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later\\nthan I would have, because I’m never going over to\\nthe Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor\\ntonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me!\\nVoldemort killed my parents, remember?”\\nHe glared at them.\\n \\n“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.\\n“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just\\nlucky I got it back.”\\n“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.\\n“All — all three of us?”\\n“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go\\nalone?”\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you\\nthink you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go\\nand look through my books, there might be\\nsomething useful. ...”\\n“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”\\n“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick\\ntold me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve\\npercent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out\\nafter that.”\\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in\\nthe common room. Nobody bothered them; none of\\nthe Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any\\nmore, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been\\nupset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her\\nnotes, hoping to come across one of the\\nenchantments they were about to try to break. Harry\\nand Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were\\nthinking about what they were about to do.\\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\\n“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan\\nfinally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran\\nupstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the\\n \\ncloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had\\ngiven him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on\\nFluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.\\nHe ran back down to the common room.\\n“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it\\ncovers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet\\nwandering along on its own — ”\\n“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of\\nthe room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair,\\nclutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d\\nbeen making another bid for freedom.\\n“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly\\nputting the cloak behind his back.\\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.\\n“You’re going out again,” he said.\\n“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t\\nyou go to bed, Neville?”\\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door.\\nThey couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape\\nmight even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\\n“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught\\nagain. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.”\\n“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is\\nimportant.”\\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do\\nsomething desperate.\\n \\n“I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in\\nfront of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”\\n“Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and\\ndon’t be an idiot — ”\\n“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t\\nthink you should be breaking any more rules! And\\nyou were the one who told me to stand up to people!”\\n“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation.\\n“Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.”\\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the\\ntoad, who leapt out of sight.\\n“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his\\nfists. “I’m ready!”\\nHarry turned to Hermione.\\n“Do something,” he said desperately.\\nHermione stepped forward.\\n“Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.”\\nShe raised her wand.\\n“Petrificus Totalusl” she cried, pointing it at Neville.\\nNeville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang\\ntogether. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he\\nstood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.\\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were\\njammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes\\nwere moving, looking at them in horror.\\n \\n“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.\\n“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably.\\n“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.”\\n“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.\\n“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they\\nstepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.\\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t\\nfeel like a very good omen. In their nervous state,\\nevery statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant\\nbreath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on\\nthem.\\nAt the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs.\\nNorris skulking near the top.\\n“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in\\nHarry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they\\nclimbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her\\nlamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything.\\nThey didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the\\nstaircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing\\nhalfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would\\ntrip.\\n“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed\\ntoward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes.\\n“Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you\\nghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”\\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at\\nthem.\\n“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping\\naround unseen.”\\n \\nHarry had a sudden idea.\\n“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody\\nBaron has his own reasons for being invisible.”\\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught\\nhimself in time and hovered about a foot off the\\nstairs.\\n“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said\\ngreasily. “My mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you\\n— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old\\nPeevsie his little joke, sir.”\\n“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay\\naway from this place tonight.”\\n“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up\\nin the air again. “Hope your business goes well,\\nBaron, I’ll not bother you.”\\nAnd he scooted off.\\n“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.\\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the\\nthird-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar.\\n“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s\\nalready got past Fluffy.”\\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress\\nupon all three of them what was facing them.\\nUnderneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\\n“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said.\\n“You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.”\\n“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.\\n \\n“We’re coming,” said Hermione.\\nHarry pushed the door open.\\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their\\nears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their\\ndirection, even though it couldn’t see them.\\n“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.\\n“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it\\nthere.”\\n“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said\\nHarry. “Well, here goes ...”\\nHe put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t\\nreally a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes\\nbegan to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the\\ndog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell\\nto its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast\\nasleep.\\n“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out\\nof the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They\\ncould feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they\\napproached the giant heads.\\n“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron,\\npeering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first,\\nHermione?”\\n“No, I don’t!”\\n“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully\\nover the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the\\ntrapdoor, which swung up and open.\\n“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.\\n \\n“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing\\ndown, we’ll just have to drop.”\\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to\\nget his attention and pointed at himself.\\n“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I\\ndon’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to\\nHermione so she can keep him asleep.”\\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’\\nsilence, the dog growled and twitched, but the\\nmoment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its\\ndeep sleep.\\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the\\ntrapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.\\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was\\nhanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at\\nRon and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t\\nfollow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\\nDumbledore, right?”\\n“Right,” said Ron.\\n“See you in a minute, I hope. ...”\\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as\\nhe fell down, down, down and —\\nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he\\nlanded on something soft. He sat up and felt around,\\nhis eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he\\nwas sitting on some sort of plant.\\n“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a\\npostage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a\\nsoft landing, you can jump!”\\n \\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to\\nHarry.\\n“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.\\n“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here\\nto break the fall. Come on, Hermione!”\\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark\\nfrom the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She\\nlanded on Harry’s other side.\\n“We must be miles under the school,” she said.\\n“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.\\n“Lucky\\\\” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”\\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She\\nhad to struggle because the moment she had landed,\\nthe plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils\\naround her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs\\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers\\nwithout their noticing.\\nHermione had managed to free herself before the\\nplant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in\\nhorror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off\\nthem, but the more they strained against it, the\\ntighter and faster the plant wound around them.\\n“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what\\nthis is — it’s Devil’s Snare!”\\n“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a\\ngreat help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop\\nthe plant from curling around his neck.\\n \\n“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said\\nHermione.\\n“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped,\\nwrestling with it as it curled around his chest.\\n“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare ... what did Professor\\nSprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp — ”\\n“So light a fire!” Harry choked.\\n“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione\\ncried, wringing her hands.\\n“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A\\nWITCH OR NOT?”\\n“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her\\nwand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of\\nthe same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at\\nthe plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it\\nloosening its grip as it cringed away from the light\\nand warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself\\nfrom their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\\n“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,”\\nsaid Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat\\noff his face.\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his\\nhead in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”\\n“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone\\npassageway, which was the only way forward.\\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the\\ngentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The\\npassageway sloped downward, and Harry was\\nreminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the\\n \\nheart, he remembered the dragons said to be\\nguarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a\\ndragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad\\nenough ...\\n“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.\\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to\\nbe coming from up ahead.\\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?”\\n“I don’t know ... sounds like wings to me.”\\n“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”\\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw\\nbefore them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling\\narching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-\\nbright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the\\nroom. On the opposite side of the chamber was a\\nheavy wooden door.\\n“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?”\\nsaid Ron.\\n“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious,\\nbut I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . .\\nwell, there’s no other choice ... I’ll run.”\\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms,\\nand sprinted across the room. He expected to feel\\nsharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second,\\nbut nothing happened. He reached the door\\nuntouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved\\nat the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when\\nHermione tried her Alohomora Charm.\\n \\n“Now what?” said Ron.\\n“These birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,”\\nsaid Hermione.\\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering —\\nglittering?\\n“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re\\nkeys\\\\ Winged keys — look carefully. So that must\\nmean ...” he looked around the chamber while the\\nother two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes —\\nlook! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the\\ndoor!”\\n“But there are hundreds of them!”\\nRon examined the lock on the door.\\n“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably\\nsilver, like the handle.”\\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the\\nair, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They\\ngrabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted\\nand dived so quickly it was almost impossible to\\ncatch one.\\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest\\nSeeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting\\nthings other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving\\nabout through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he\\nnoticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it\\nhad already been caught and stuffed roughly into the\\nkeyhole.\\n“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one —\\nthere — no, there — with bright blue wings — the\\nfeathers are all crumpled on one side.”\\n \\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was\\npointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off\\nhis broom.\\n“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking\\nhis eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “Ron, you\\ncome at it from above — Hermione, stay below and\\nstop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it.\\nRight, NOW!”\\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key\\ndodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped\\ntoward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a\\nnasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone\\nwith one hand. Ron and Hermione ’s cheers echoed\\naround the high chamber.\\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the\\nkey struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock\\nand turned — it worked. The moment the lock had\\nclicked open, the key took flight again, looking very\\nbattered now that it had been caught twice.\\n“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the\\ndoor handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see\\nanything at all. But as they stepped into it, light\\nsuddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing\\nsight.\\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard,\\nbehind the black chessmen, which were all taller than\\nthey were and carved from what looked like black\\nstone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were\\nthe white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered\\nslightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.\\n“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.\\n \\n“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our\\nway across the room.”\\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\\n“How?” said Hermione nervously.\\n“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be\\nchessmen.”\\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out\\nto touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang\\nto life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight\\nturned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\\n“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?”\\nThe black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other\\ntwo.\\n“This needs thinking about. ...” he said. “I suppose\\nwe’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces.\\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron\\nthink. Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or\\nanything, but neither of you are that good at chess —\\n“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us\\nwhat to do.”\\n“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and\\nHermione, you go there instead of that castle.”\\n“What about you?”\\n“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.\\n \\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because\\nat these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned\\ntheir backs on the white pieces and walked off the\\nboard, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione took.\\n“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering\\nacross the board. “Yes ... look ...”\\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved\\nsilently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were\\ntrembling. What if they lost?\\n“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”\\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight\\nwas taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor\\nand dragged him off the board, where he lay quite\\nstill, facedown.\\n“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken.\\n“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go\\non.”\\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces\\nshowed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp\\nblack players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only\\njust noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in\\ndanger. He himself darted around the board, taking\\nalmost as many white pieces as they had lost black\\nones.\\n“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me\\nthink — let me think ...”\\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\\n \\n“Yes ...” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way ... I’ve got\\nto be taken.”\\n“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.\\n“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make\\nsome sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me —\\nthat leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”\\n“But — ”\\n“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”\\n“Ron — ”\\n“Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the\\nStone!”\\nThere was no alternative.\\n“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined.\\n“Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve\\nwon.”\\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced.\\nShe struck Ron hard across the head with her stone\\narm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione\\nscreamed but stayed on her square — the white\\nqueen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d\\nbeen knocked out.\\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at\\nHarry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and\\nbowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last\\ndesperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione\\ncharged through the door and up the next\\npassageway.\\n \\n“What if he’s — ?”\\n“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince\\nhimself. “What do you reckon’s next?”\\n“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare;\\nFlitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall\\ntransfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that\\nleaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...”\\nThey had reached another door.\\n“All right?” Harry whispered.\\n“Go on.”\\nHarry pushed it open.\\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of\\nthem pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes\\nwatering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a\\ntroll even larger than the one they had tackled, out\\ncold with a bloody lump on its head.\\n“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry\\nwhispered as they stepped carefully over one of its\\nmassive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”\\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly\\ndaring to look at what came next — but there was\\nnothing very frightening in here, just a table with\\nseven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a\\nline.\\n“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”\\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a\\nfire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t\\nordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same\\n \\ninstant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading\\nonward. They were trapped.\\n“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to\\nthe bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\\nTwo of us will help you, whichever you would find,\\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,\\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead,\\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\\nThree of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.\\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues\\nfour:\\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide\\nYou will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;\\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end,\\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size,\\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right\\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first\\nsight\\n \\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw\\nthat she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like\\ndoing.\\n“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s\\nlogic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t\\ngot an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.”\\n“But so will we, won’t we?”\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need\\nis here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison;\\ntwo are wine; one will get us safely through the black\\nfire, and one will get us back through the purple.”\\n“But how do we know which to drink?”\\n“Give me a minute.”\\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she\\nwalked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to\\nherself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her\\nhands.\\n“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us\\nthrough the black fire — toward the Stone.”\\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\\n“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said.\\n“That’s hardly one swallow.”\\nThey looked at each other.\\n“Which one will get you back through the purple\\nflames?”\\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end\\nof the line.\\n \\n“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and\\nget Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room,\\nthey’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy —\\ngo straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\\nDumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold\\nSnape off for a while, but I’m no match for him,\\nreally.”\\n“But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with him?”\\n“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry,\\npointing at his scar. “I might get lucky again.”\\nHermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at\\nHarry and threw her arms around him.\\n“Hermionel”\\n“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”\\n“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very\\nembarrassed, as she let go of him.\\n“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There\\nare more important things — friendship and bravery\\nand — oh Harry — be carefull”\\n“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is\\nwhich, aren’t you?”\\n“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from\\nthe round bottle at the end, and shuddered.\\n“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.\\n“No — but it’s like ice.”\\n“Quick, go, before it wears off.”\\n \\n“Good luck — take care — ”\\n“GO!”\\nHermione turned and walked straight through the\\npurple fire.\\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest\\nbottle. He turned to face the black flames.\\n“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle\\nin one gulp.\\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He\\nput the bottle down and walked forward; he braced\\nhimself, saw the black flames licking his body, but\\ncouldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see\\nnothing but dark fire — then he was on the other\\nside, in the last chamber.\\nThere was already someone there — but it wasn’t\\nSnape. It wasn’t even Voldemort.\\n \\nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES\\nIt was Quirrell.\\n“You\\\\” gasped Harry.\\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all.\\n“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be\\nmeeting you here, Potter.”\\n“But I thought — Snape — ”\\n“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual\\nquivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes,\\nSeverus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to\\nhave him swooping around like an overgrown bat.\\nNext to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-\\nstuttering P-Professor Quirrell?”\\nHarry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it\\ncouldn’t.\\n“But Snape tried to kill me!”\\n \\n“No, no, no. / tried to kill you. Your friend Miss\\nGranger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed\\nto set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She\\nbroke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds\\nand I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed\\nit before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a\\ncountercurse, trying to save you.”\\n“Snape was trying to save me?”\\n“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think\\nhe wanted to referee your next match? He was trying\\nto make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny, really ... he\\nneedn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with\\nDumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought\\nSnape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he\\ndid make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of\\ntime, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.”\\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin\\nair and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\\n“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the\\nschool on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d\\nseen me coming to look at what was guarding the\\nStone.”\\n“ You let the troll in?”\\n“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must\\nhave seen what I did to the one in the chamber back\\nthere? Unfortunately, while everyone else was\\nrunning around looking for it, Snape, who already\\nsuspected me, went straight to the third floor to head\\nme off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to\\ndeath, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to\\nbite Snape ’s leg off properly.\\n \\n“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this\\ninteresting mirror.”\\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was\\nstanding behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\\n“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell\\nmurmured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust\\nDumbledore to come up with something like this . . .\\nbut he’s in London ... I’ll be far away by the time he\\ngets back. ...”\\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell\\ntalking and stop him from concentrating on the\\nmirror.\\n“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ” he blurted out.\\n“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to\\nlook at the back. “He was on to me by that time,\\ntrying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected me all\\nalong. Tried to frighten me — as though he could,\\nwhen I had Lord Voldemort on my side. ...”\\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and\\nstared hungrily into it.\\n“I see the Stone ... I’m presenting it to my master ...\\nbut where is it?”\\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but\\nthey didn’t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving\\nhis whole attention to the mirror.\\n“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”\\n“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes.\\nHe was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you\\n \\nknow? They loathed each other. But he never wanted\\nyou dead.”\\n“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought\\nSnape was threatening you.\\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across\\nQuirrell’s face.\\n“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my\\nmaster’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am\\nweak — ”\\n“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?”\\nHarry gasped.\\n“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I\\nmet him when I traveled around the world. A foolish\\nyoung man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about\\ngood and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong\\nI was. There is no good and evil, there is only power,\\nand those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have\\nserved him faithfully, although I have let him down\\nmany times. He has had to be very hard on me.”\\nQuirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive\\nmistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from\\nGringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me\\n. . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on\\nme. ...”\\nQuirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering\\nhis trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so\\nstupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken\\nhands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\\n“I don’t understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror?\\nShould I break it?”\\n \\nHarry’s mind was racing.\\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at\\nthe moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before\\nQuirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see\\nmy self finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s\\nhidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing\\nwhat I’m up to?\\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass\\nwithout Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his\\nankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell\\nignored him. He was still talking to himself.\\n“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help\\nme, Master!”\\nAnd to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice\\nseemed to come from Quirrell himself.\\n“Use the boy ... Use the boy ...”\\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\\n“Yes — Potter — come here.”\\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding\\nHarry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.\\n“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror\\nand tell me what you see.”\\nHarry walked toward him.\\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie\\nabout what I see, that’s all.\\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in\\nthe funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s\\n \\nturban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the\\nmirror, and opened them again.\\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first.\\nBut a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It\\nput its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-\\nred stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its\\npocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy\\ndrop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly —\\nhe’d gotten the Stone.\\n“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”\\nHarry screwed up his courage.\\n“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he\\ninvented. “I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.”\\nQuirrell cursed again.\\n“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside,\\nhe felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he\\nmake a break for it?\\nBut he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice\\nspoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips.\\n“He lies ... He lies ...”\\n“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me\\nthe truth! What did you just see?”\\nThe high voice spoke again.\\n“Let me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...”\\n“Master, you are not strong enough!”\\n“I have strength enough ... for this. ...”\\n \\nHarry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the\\nspot. He couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, he\\nwatched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap\\nhis turban. What was going on? The turban fell away.\\nQuirrell’s head looked strangely small without it.\\nThen he turned slowly on the spot.\\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a\\nsound. Where there should have been a back to\\nQuirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible\\nface Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with\\nglaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\\n“Harry Potter ...” it whispered.\\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs\\nwouldn’t move.\\n“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere\\nshadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can\\nshare another’s body . . . but there have always been\\nthose willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ...\\nUnicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks\\n. . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the\\nforest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be\\nable to create a body of my own. ... Now ... why don’t\\nyou give me that Stone in your pocket?”\\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into\\nHarry’s legs. He stumbled backward.\\n“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your\\nown life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as\\nyour parents. ... They died begging me for mercy. ...”\\n“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.\\n \\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that\\nVoldemort could still see him. The evil face was now\\nsmiling.\\n“How touching ...” it hissed. “I always value bravery.\\n... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your\\nfather first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but\\nyour mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to\\nprotect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you\\nwant her to have died in vain.”\\n“NEVER!”\\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort\\nscreamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harry\\nfelt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. At once, a\\nneedle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his\\nhead felt as though it was about to split in two; he\\nyelled, struggling with all his might, and to his\\nsurprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head\\nlessened — he looked around wildly to see where\\nQuirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain,\\nlooking at his fingers — they were blistering before his\\neyes.\\n“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again,\\nand Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet,\\nlanding on top of him, both hands around Harry’s\\nneck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with\\npain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\\n“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my\\nhands!”\\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground\\nwith his knees, let go of his neck and stared,\\nbewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they\\nlooked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\\n \\n“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched\\nVoldemort.\\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse,\\nbut Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed\\nQuirrell’s face —\\n“AAAARGH!”\\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and\\nthen Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare\\nskin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only\\nchance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in\\nenough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm,\\nand hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed\\nand tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s\\nhead was building — he couldn’t see — he could only\\nhear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells\\nof, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in\\nHarry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”\\nHe felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew\\nall was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ...\\ndown ...\\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The\\nSnitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too\\nheavy.\\nHe blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of\\nglasses. How strange.\\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus\\nDumbledore swam into view above him.\\n“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.\\n \\nHarry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The\\nStone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —\\n“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the\\ntimes,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the\\nStone.”\\n“Then who does? Sir, I — ”\\n“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me\\nthrown out.”\\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized\\nhe must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed\\nwith white linen sheets, and next to him was a table\\npiled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\\n“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said\\nDumbledore, beaming. “What happened down in the\\ndungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\\ncomplete secret, so, naturally, the whole school\\nknows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George\\nWeasley were responsible for trying to send you a\\ntoilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse\\nyou. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be\\nvery hygienic, and confiscated it.”\\n“How long have I been in here?”\\n“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger\\nwill be most relieved you have come round, they have\\nbeen extremely worried.”\\n“But sir, the Stone — ”\\n“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the\\nStone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it\\n \\nfrom you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although\\nyou were doing very well on your own, I must say.”\\n“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”\\n“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I\\nreached London than it became clear to me that the\\nplace I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived\\njust in time to pull Quirrell off you — ”\\n“It was you.”\\n“I feared I might be too late.”\\n“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the\\nStone much longer — ”\\n“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly\\nkilled you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid\\nit had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.”\\n“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend —\\nNicolas Flamel — ”\\n“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore,\\nsounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing\\nproperly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a\\nlittle chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”\\n“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”\\n“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in\\norder and then, yes, they will die.”\\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on\\nHarry’s face.\\n“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible,\\nbut to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to\\n \\nbed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-\\norganized mind, death is but the next great\\nadventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a\\nwonderful thing. As much money and life as you\\ncould want! The two things most human beings would\\nchoose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a\\nknack of choosing precisely those things that are\\nworst for them.”\\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed\\na little and smiled at the ceiling.\\n“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking ... Sir — even if\\nthe Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ”\\n“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper\\nname for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the\\nthing itself.”\\n“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of\\ncoming back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has\\nhe?”\\n“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there\\nsomewhere, perhaps looking for another body to\\nshare ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He\\nleft Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his\\nfollowers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while\\nyou may only have delayed his return to power, it will\\nmerely take someone else who is prepared to fight\\nwhat seems a losing battle next time — and if he is\\ndelayed again, and again, why, he may never return\\nto power.”\\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made\\nhis head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some\\nother things I’d like to know, if you can tell me ...\\nthings I want to know the truth about. ...”\\n \\n“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and\\nterrible thing, and should therefore be treated with\\ngreat caution. However, I shall answer your questions\\nunless I have a very good reason not to, in which case\\nI beg you 11 forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”\\n“Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother\\nbecause she tried to stop him from killing me. But\\nwhy would he want to kill me in the first place?”\\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\\n“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you.\\nNot today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it\\nfrom your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . .\\nI know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready,\\nyou will know.”\\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\\n“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?”\\n“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing\\nVoldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t\\nrealize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you\\nleaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to\\nhave been loved so deeply, even though the person\\nwho loved us is gone, will give us some protection\\nforever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred,\\ngreed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,\\ncould not touch you for this reason. It was agony to\\ntouch a person marked by something so good.”\\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out\\non the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his\\neyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again,\\nHarry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know\\nwho sent it to me?”\\n \\n“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my\\npossession, and I thought you might like it.”\\nDumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things ... your\\nfather used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens\\nto steal food when he was here.”\\n“And there’s something else ...”\\n“Fire away.”\\n“Quirrell said Snape — ”\\n“Professor Snape, Harry.”\\n“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he\\nhated my father. Is that true?”\\n“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike\\nyourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did\\nsomething Snape could never forgive.”\\n“What?”\\n“He saved his life.”\\n“What?”\\n“Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way\\npeople’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape\\ncouldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. ... I do\\nbelieve he worked so hard to protect you this year\\nbecause he felt that would make him and your father\\neven. Then he could go back to hating your father’s\\nmemory in peace. ...”\\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head\\npound, so he stopped.\\n“And sir, there’s one more thing ...”\\n \\n“Just the one?”\\n“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”\\n“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of\\nmy more brilliant ideas, and between you and me,\\nthat’s saying something. You see, only one who\\nwanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it —\\nwould be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see\\nthemselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My\\nbrain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough\\nquestions. I suggest you make a start on these\\nsweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was\\nunfortunate enough in my youth to come across a\\nvomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve\\nrather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe\\nwith a nice toffee, don’t you?”\\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his\\nmouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”\\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but\\nvery strict.\\n“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded.\\n“Absolutely not.”\\n“You let Professor Dumbledore in. ...”\\n“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite\\ndifferent. You need rest.”\\n“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go\\non, Madam Pomfrey ...”\\n“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.”\\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.\\n \\n“Harryl”\\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him\\nagain, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his\\nhead was still very sore.\\n“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to —\\nDumbledore was so worried — ”\\n“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What\\nreally happened?”\\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story\\nis even more strange and exciting than the wild\\nrumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the\\nmirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione\\nwere a very good audience; they gasped in all the\\nright places, and when Harry told them what was\\nunder Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\\n“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just\\ngoing to die?”\\n“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that —\\nwhat was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is\\nbut the next great adventure.’ ”\\n“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron,\\nlooking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\\n“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.\\n“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought\\nRon round — that took a while — and we were\\ndashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when\\nwe met him in the entrance hall — he already knew —\\nhe just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and\\nhurtled off to the third floor.”\\n \\n“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron.\\n“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?”\\n“Well,” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say\\n— that’s terrible — you could have been killed.”\\n“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny\\nman, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give\\nme a chance. I think he knows more or less\\neverything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he\\nhad a pretty good idea we were going to try, and\\ninstead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to\\nhelp. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find\\nout how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought\\nI had the right to face Voldemort if I could. ...”\\n“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said\\nRon proudly. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-\\nof-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and\\nSlytherin won, of course — you missed the last\\nQuidditch match, we were steamrollered by\\nRavenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.”\\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\\n“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she\\nsaid firmly.\\n•k k k\\nAfter a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to\\nnormal.\\n“I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as\\nshe straightened his many candy boxes. “I can, can’t\\nI?”\\n \\n“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to\\ngo,” she said sniffily, as though in her opinion\\nProfessor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts\\ncould be. “And you have another visitor.”\\n“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?”\\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual\\nwhen he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be\\nallowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at\\nhim, and burst into tears.\\n“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his\\nface in his hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past\\nFluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn’t\\nknow, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a\\ndragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked\\nout an’ made ter live as a Muggle!”\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking\\nwith grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into\\nhis beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow,\\nthis is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found\\nout even if you hadn’t told him.”\\n“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the\\nname!”\\n“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so\\nshocked, he stopped crying. “I’ve met him and I’m\\ncalling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we\\nsaved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a\\nChocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. ...”\\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and\\nsaid, “That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.”\\n“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry\\nanxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.\\n \\n“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter\\nfix it. ’Course, he shoulda sacked me instead —\\nanyway, got y eh this ...”\\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book.\\nHarry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard\\nphotographs. Smiling and waving at him from every\\npage were his mother and father.\\n“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends,\\naskin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh\\nlike it?”\\nHarry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.\\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast\\nalone that night. He had been held up by Madam\\nPomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one\\nlast checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It\\nwas decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and\\nsilver to celebrate Slytherin ’s winning the House Cup\\nfor the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing\\nthe Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the\\nHigh Table.\\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and\\nthen everybody started talking loudly at once. He\\nslipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the\\nGryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that\\npeople were standing up to look at him.\\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The\\nbabble died away.\\n“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully.\\n“And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing\\nwaffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious\\nfeast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads\\nare all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the\\n \\nwhole summer ahead to get them nice and empty\\nbefore next year starts. ...\\n“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs\\nawarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place,\\nGryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in\\nthird, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two;\\nRavenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and\\nSlytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.”\\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the\\nSlytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging\\nhis goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.\\n“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore.\\n“However, recent events must be taken into account.”\\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded\\na little.\\n“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute\\npoints to dish out. Let me see. Yes ...\\n“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...”\\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish\\nwith a bad sunburn.\\n\"... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has\\nseen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty\\npoints.”\\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling;\\nthe stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be\\nheard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you\\nknow! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s\\ngiant chess set!”\\nAt last there was silence again.\\n \\n“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of\\ncool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House\\nfifty points.”\\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly\\nsuspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up\\nand down the table were beside themselves — they\\nwere a hundred points up.\\n“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore.\\nThe room went deadly quiet. \"... for pure nerve and\\noutstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty\\npoints.”\\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while\\nyelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now\\nhad four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly\\nthe same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House\\nCup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one\\nmore point.\\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell\\nsilent.\\n“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore,\\nsmiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up\\nto our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our\\nfriends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville\\nLongbottom.”\\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well\\nhave thought some sort of explosion had taken place,\\nso loud was the noise that erupted from the\\nGryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up\\nto yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock,\\ndisappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He\\nhad never won so much as a point for Gryffindor\\nbefore. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs\\nand pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more\\n \\nstunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind\\nCurse put on him.\\n“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of\\napplause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were\\ncelebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little\\nchange of decoration.”\\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green\\nhangings became scarlet and the silver became gold;\\nthe huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering\\nGryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking\\nProfessor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced\\nsmile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once\\nthat Snape ’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one\\njot. This didn’t worry Harry. It seemed as though life\\nwould be back to normal next year, or as normal as it\\never was at Hogwarts.\\nIt was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than\\nwinning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out\\nmountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight.\\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results\\nwere still to come, but come they did. To their great\\nsurprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks;\\nHermione, of course, had the best grades of the first\\nyears. Even Neville scraped through, his good\\nHerbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions\\none. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as\\nstupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he\\nhad passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you\\ncouldn’t have everything in life.\\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their\\ntrunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking\\nin a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all\\nstudents, warning them not to use magic over the\\nholidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us\\n \\nthese,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to\\ntake them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across\\nthe lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express;\\ntalking and laughing as the countryside became\\ngreener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor\\nBeans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off\\ntheir wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats;\\npulling into platform nine and three-quarters at\\nKing’s Cross station.\\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the\\nplatform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket\\nbarrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and\\nthrees so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting\\nout of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\\n“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron,\\n“both of you — I’ll send you an owl.”\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look\\nforward to.”\\nPeople jostled them as they moved forward toward the\\ngateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them\\ncalled:\\n“Bye, Harry!”\\n“See you, Potter!”\\n“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him.\\n“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry.\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway\\ntogether.\\n“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!”\\n \\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she\\nwasn’t pointing at Ron.\\n“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see\\n“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.”\\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\\n“Busy year?” she said.\\n“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the\\nsweater, Mrs. Weasley.”\\n“Oh, it was nothing, dear.”\\n“Ready, are you?”\\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still\\nmustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry,\\ncarrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary\\npeople. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley,\\nlooking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\\n“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley.\\n“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry\\nup, boy, we haven’t got all day.” He walked away.\\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and\\nHermione.\\n“See you over the summer, then.”\\n“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said\\nHermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon,\\nshocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.\\n \\n“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at\\nthe grin that was spreading over his face. “ They don’t\\nknow we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m\\ngoing to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...”\\n \\nJ . K . R O W L ! N G\\nHARRY\\nPOTTER\\n/\\nTHE WORST BIRTHDAY\\nNot for the first time, an argument had broken out\\nover breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr.\\nVernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of\\nthe morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew\\nHarry’s room.\\n“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If\\nyou can’t control that owl, it’ll have to go!”\\nHarry tried, yet again, to explain.\\n“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around\\noutside. If I could just let her out at night — ”\\n“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of\\nfried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. “I know\\nwhat 11 happen if that owl’s let out.”\\nHe exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.\\nHarry tried to argue back but his words were drowned\\nby a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.\\n \\n“I want more bacon.”\\n“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt\\nPetunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. “We\\nmust build you up while we’ve got the chance. ... I\\ndon’t like the sound of that school food. ...”\\n“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when / was\\nat Smeltings,” said Uncle Vernon heartily. “Dudley\\ngets enough, don’t you, son?”\\nDudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over\\neither side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to\\nHarry.\\n“Pass the frying pan.”\\n“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry\\nirritably.\\nThe effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the\\nfamily was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his\\nchair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs.\\nDursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands\\nto her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins\\nthrobbing in his temples.\\n“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean\\n“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle,\\nspraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’\\nWORD IN OUR HOUSE?”\\n“But I — ”\\n“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared\\nUncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.\\n \\n“I just — ”\\n“I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION\\nOF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!”\\nHarry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale\\naunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet.\\n“All right,” said Harry, “all right ...”\\nUncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded\\nrhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the\\ncorners of his small, sharp eyes.\\nEver since Harry had come home for the summer\\nholidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a\\nbomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry\\nPotter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he\\nwas as not normal as it is possible to be.\\nHarry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his\\nfirst year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\\nWizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have\\nhim back for the holidays, it was nothing to how\\nHarry felt.\\nHe missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a\\nconstant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its\\nsecret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though\\nperhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail\\narriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall,\\nsleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory,\\nvisiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to\\nthe Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially,\\nQuidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding\\nworld (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and\\nfourteen players on broomsticks).\\n \\nAll Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and\\ntop-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had\\nbeen locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle\\nVernon the instant Harry had come home. What did\\nthe Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House\\nQuidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all\\nsummer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went\\nback to school without any of his homework done?\\nThe Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a\\ndrop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as\\nthey were concerned, having a wizard in the family\\nwas a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had\\neven padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage,\\nto stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the\\nwizarding world.\\nHarry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle\\nVernon was large and neckless, with an enormous\\nblack mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and\\nbony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on\\nthe other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant\\ngreen eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy.\\nHe wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a\\nthin, lightning-shaped scar.\\nIt was this scar that made Harry so particularly\\nunusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only\\nhint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he\\nhad been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years\\nbefore.\\nAt the age of one year old, Harry had somehow\\nsurvived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all\\ntime, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and\\nwizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died\\nin Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his\\nlightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood\\nwhy — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the\\ninstant he had failed to kill Harry.\\n \\nSo Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s\\nsister and her husband. He had spent ten years with\\nthe Dursleys, never understanding why he kept\\nmaking odd things happen without meaning to,\\nbelieving the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar\\nin the car crash that had killed his parents.\\nAnd then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to\\nHarry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had\\ntaken up his place at wizard school, where he and his\\nscar were famous . . . but now the school year was\\nover, and he was back with the Dursleys for the\\nsummer, back to being treated like a dog that had\\nrolled in something smelly.\\nThe Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today\\nhappened to be Harry’s twelfth birthday. Of course,\\nhis hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a\\nreal present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it\\ncompletely ...\\nAt that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat\\nimportantly and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a\\nvery important day.”\\nHarry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.\\n“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of\\nmy career,” said Uncle Vernon.\\nHarry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought\\nbitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid\\ndinner party. He’d been talking of nothing else for two\\nweeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to\\ndinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge\\norder from him (Uncle Vernon’s company made drills).\\n \\n“I think we should run through the schedule one\\nmore time,” said Uncle Vernon. “We should all be in\\nposition at eight o’clock. Petunia, you will be — ?”\\n“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting\\nto welcome them graciously to our home.”\\n“Good, good. And Dudley?”\\n“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a\\nfoul, simpering smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and\\nMrs. Mason?”\\n“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.\\n“Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon. Then he\\nrounded on Harry. “And you?”\\n“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and\\npretending I’m not there,” said Harry tonelessly.\\n“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. “I will lead them\\ninto the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour\\nthem drinks. At eight-fifteen — ”\\n“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia.\\n“And, Dudley, you 11 say — ”\\n“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs.\\nMason?” said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an\\ninvisible woman.\\n“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia.\\n“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.\\n“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending\\nI’m not there,” said Harry dully.\\n \\n“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good\\ncompliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?”\\n“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr.\\nMason. ... Do tell me where you bought your dress,\\nMrs. Mason. ...”\\n“Perfect ... Dudley?”\\n“How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our\\nhero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’ ”\\nThis was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry.\\nAunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son,\\nwhile Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn’t\\nsee him laughing.\\n“And you, boy?”\\nHarry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.\\n“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending\\nI’m not there,” he said.\\n“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully.\\n“The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s\\ngoing to stay that way. When dinner’s over, you take\\nMrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia,\\nand I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With any\\nluck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the\\nnews at ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation home in\\nMajorca this time tomorrow.”\\nHarry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t\\nthink the Dursleys would like him any better in\\nMajorca than they did on Privet Drive.\\n“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner\\njackets for Dudley and me. And you,” he snarled at\\n \\nHarry. “You stay out of your aunt’s way while she’s\\ncleaning.”\\nHarry left through the back door. It was a brilliant,\\nsunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on\\nthe garden bench, and sang under his breath:\\n“Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me ...”\\nNo cards, no presents, and he would be spending the\\nevening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably\\ninto the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than\\nanything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing\\nQuidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron\\nWeasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn’t\\nseem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had\\nwritten to him all summer, even though Ron had said\\nhe was going to ask Harry to come and stay.\\nCountless times, Harry had been on the point of\\nunlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to\\nRon and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth\\nthe risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use\\nmagic outside of school. Harry hadn’t told the\\nDursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he\\nmight turn them all into dung beetles that stopped\\nthem from locking him in the cupboard under the\\nstairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first\\ncouple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering\\nnonsense words under his breath and watching\\nDudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs\\nwould carry him. But the long silence from Ron and\\nHermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the\\nmagical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its\\nappeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten\\nhis birthday.\\nWhat wouldn’t he give now for a message from\\nHogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He’d almost be\\n \\nglad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to\\nbe sure it hadn’t all been a dream. ...\\nNot that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At\\nthe very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face\\nwith none other than Lord Voldemort himself.\\nVoldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he\\nwas still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to\\nregain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s\\nclutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow\\nescape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking\\nin the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where\\nVoldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his\\nwide, mad eyes —\\nHarry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench.\\nHe had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge\\n— and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous\\ngreen eyes had appeared among the leaves.\\nHarry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated\\nacross the lawn.\\n“I know what day it is,” sang Dudley, waddling toward\\nhim.\\nThe huge eyes blinked and vanished.\\n“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot\\nwhere they had been.\\n“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right\\nup to him.\\n“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ve finally learned the\\ndays of the week.”\\n \\n“Today’s your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come\\nyou haven’t got any cards? Haven’t you even got\\nfriends at that freak place?”\\n“Better not let your mum hear you talking about my\\nschool,” said Harry coolly.\\nDudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping\\ndown his fat bottom.\\n“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said\\nsuspiciously.\\n“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to\\nset it on fire,” said Harry.\\nDudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic\\non his fat face.\\n“You c-can’t — Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic\\n— he said hell chuck you out of the house — and you\\nhaven’t got anywhere else to go — you haven’t got any\\nfriends to take you — ”\\n“ Jiggery pokeryV ’ said Harry in a fierce voice. “Hocus\\npocus — squiggly wiggly — ”\\n“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet\\nas he dashed back toward the house. “MUUUUM!\\nHe’s doing you know what!”\\nHarry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither\\nDudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt\\nPetunia knew he hadn’t really done magic, but he still\\nhad to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head\\nwith the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to\\ndo, with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d\\nfinished.\\n \\nWhile Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice\\ncream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car,\\nmowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and\\nwatered the roses, and repainted the garden bench.\\nThe sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his\\nneck. Harry knew he shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s\\nbait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had\\nbeen thinking himself ... maybe he didn’t have any\\nfriends at Hogwarts. ...\\nWish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he\\nthought savagely as he spread manure on the flower\\nbeds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.\\nIt was half past seven in the evening when at last,\\nexhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.\\n“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!”\\nHarry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming\\nkitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding:\\na huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets.\\nA loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.\\n“Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped\\nAunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a\\nlump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already\\nwearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.\\nHarry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful\\nsupper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia\\nwhisked away his plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!”\\nAs he passed the door to the living room, Harry\\ncaught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow\\nties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the\\nupstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle\\nVernon’s furious face appeared at the foot of the\\nstairs.\\n \\n“Remember, boy — one sound — ”\\nHarry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped\\ninside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his\\nbed.\\nThe trouble was, there was already someone sitting\\non it.\\n \\nDOBBY’S WARNING\\nHarry managed not to shout out, but it was a close\\nthing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat-\\nlike ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis\\nballs. Harry knew instantly that this was what had\\nbeen watching him out of the garden hedge that\\nmorning.\\nAs they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s\\nvoice from the hall.\\n“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”\\nThe creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low\\nthat the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet.\\nHarry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an\\nold pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.\\n“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously.\\n“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched\\nvoice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. “So\\n \\nlong has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir ... Such an\\nhonor it is. ...”\\n“Th-thank you,” said Harry, edging along the wall and\\nsinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was\\nasleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, “What are\\nyou?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead\\nhe said, “Who are you?”\\n“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” said\\nthe creature.\\n“Oh — really?” said Harry. “Er — I don’t want to be\\nrude or anything, but — this isn’t a great time for me\\nto have a house-elf in my bedroom.”\\nAunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the\\nliving room. The elf hung his head.\\n“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry\\nquickly, “but, er, is there any particular reason you’re\\nhere?”\\n“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly. “Dobby has come\\nto tell you, sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders\\nwhere to begin. ...”\\n“Sit down,” said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.\\nTo his horror, the elf burst into tears — very noisy\\ntears.\\n“S-sit down).” he wailed. “Never ... never ever ...”\\nHarry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.\\n“I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I didn’t mean to offend you\\nor anything — ”\\n \\n“Offend Dobby!” choked the elf. “Dobby has never\\nbeen asked to sit down by a wizard — like an equal —\\nHarry, trying to say “Shh!” and look comforting at the\\nsame time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where\\nhe sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly\\ndoll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat\\nwith his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of\\nwatery adoration.\\n“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said\\nHarry, trying to cheer him up.\\nDobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he\\nleapt up and started banging his head furiously on\\nthe window, shouting, “Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!”\\n“Don’t — what are you doing?” Harry hissed,\\nspringing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed —\\nHedwig had woken up with a particularly loud\\nscreech and was beating her wings wildly against the\\nbars of her cage.\\n“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who\\nhad gone slightly cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill\\nof his family, sir. ...”\\n“Your family?”\\n“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. ... Dobby is a\\nhouse-elf — bound to serve one house and one family\\nforever. ...”\\n“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.\\nDobby shuddered.\\n \\n“Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself\\nmost grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will\\nhave to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they\\never knew, sir — ”\\n“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the\\noven door?”\\n“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to\\npunish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get\\non with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do\\nextra punishments. ...”\\n“But why don’t you leave? Escape?”\\n“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will\\nnever set Dobby free . . . Dobby will serve the family\\nuntil he dies, sir. ...”\\nHarry stared.\\n“And I thought I had it bad staying here for another\\nfour weeks,” he said. “This makes the Dursleys sound\\nalmost human. Can’t anyone help you? Can’t I?”\\nAlmost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken.\\nDobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude.\\n“Please,” Harry whispered frantically, “please be quiet.\\nIf the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you’re\\nhere — ”\\n“Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . Dobby has\\nheard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness,\\nDobby never knew. ...”\\nHarry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said,\\n“Whatever you’ve heard about my greatness is a load\\n \\nof rubbish. I’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts;\\nthat’s Hermione, she — ”\\nBut he stopped quickly, because thinking about\\nHermione was painful.\\n“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby\\nreverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. “Harry Potter\\nspeaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-\\nNamed — ”\\n“Voldemort?” said Harry.\\nDobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and\\nmoaned, “Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the\\nname!”\\n“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people\\ndon’t like it. My friend Ron — ”\\nHe stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful,\\ntoo.\\nDobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as\\nheadlights.\\n“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry\\nPotter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just\\nweeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped yet again.”\\nHarry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with\\ntears.\\n“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of\\nthe grubby pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter\\nis valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers\\nalready! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter,\\nto warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in\\n \\nthe oven door later. . . . Harry Potter must not go back\\nto Hogwarts.”\\nThere was a silence broken only by the chink of\\nknives and forks from downstairs and the distant\\nrumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.\\n“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back\\n— term starts on September first. It’s all that’s\\nkeeping me going. You don’t know what it’s like here.\\nI don’t belong here. I belong in your world — at\\nHogwarts.”\\n“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so\\nhard his ears flapped. “Harry Potter must stay where\\nhe is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry\\nPotter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal\\ndanger.”\\n“Why?” said Harry in surprise.\\n“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most\\nterrible things happen at Hogwarts School of\\nWitchcraft and Wizardry this year,” whispered Dobby,\\nsuddenly trembling all over. “Dobby has known it for\\nmonths, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in\\nperil. He is too important, sir!”\\n“What terrible things?” said Harry at once. “Who’s\\nplotting them?”\\nDobby made a funny choking noise and then banged\\nhis head frantically against the wall.\\n“All right!” cried Harry, grabbing the elf’s arm to stop\\nhim. “You can’t tell me. I understand. But why are\\nyou warning me?” A sudden, unpleasant thought\\nstruck him. “Hang on — this hasn’t got anything to\\ndo with Vol — sorry — with You-Know-Who, has it?\\n \\nYou could just shake or nod,” he added hastily as\\nDobby’s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again.\\nSlowly, Dobby shook his head.\\n“Not — not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir — ”\\nBut Dobby’s eyes were wide and he seemed to be\\ntrying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was\\ncompletely lost.\\n“He hasn’t got a brother, has he?”\\nDobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.\\n“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a\\nchance of making horrible things happen at\\nHogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore,\\nfor one thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t\\nyou?”\\nDobby bowed his head.\\n“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster\\nHogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby\\nhas heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of He-\\nWho-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his\\nstrength. But, sir” — Dobby’s voice dropped to an\\nurgent whisper — “there are powers Dumbledore\\ndoesn’t ... powers no decent wizard ...”\\nAnd before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off\\nthe bed, seized Harry’s desk lamp, and started\\nbeating himself around the head with earsplitting\\nyelps.\\nA sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later\\nHarry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon\\n \\ncoming into the hall, calling, “Dudley must have left\\nhis television on again, the little tyke!”\\n“Quick! In the closet!” hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby\\nin, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the\\nbed just as the door handle turned.\\n“What — the — devil — are — you — doing?” said\\nUncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly\\nclose to Harry’s. “You’ve just ruined the punch line of\\nmy Japanese golfer joke. ... One more sound and\\nyou’ll wish you’d never been born, boy!”\\nHe stomped flat-footed from the room.\\nShaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.\\n“See what it’s like here?” he said. “See why I’ve got to\\ngo back to Hogwarts? It’s the only place I’ve got —\\nwell, I think I’ve got friends.”\\n“Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?” said\\nDobby slyly.\\n“I expect they’ve just been — wait a minute,” said\\nHarry, frowning. “How do you know my friends\\nhaven’t been writing to me?”\\nDobby shuffled his feet.\\n“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. Dobby\\ndid it for the best — ”\\n“Have you been stopping my letters?”\\n“Dobby has them here, sir,” said the elf. Stepping\\nnimbly out of Harry’s reach, he pulled a thick wad of\\nenvelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was\\nwearing. Harry could make out Hermione’s neat\\n \\nwriting, Ron’s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that\\nlooked as though it was from the Hogwarts\\ngamekeeper, Hagrid.\\nDobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.\\n“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry. ... Dobby hoped ... if\\nHarry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him . . .\\nHarry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.\\nHarry wasn’t listening. He made a grab for the letters,\\nbut Dobby jumped out of reach.\\n“Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his\\nword that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this\\nis a danger you must not face! Say you won’t go back,\\nsir!”\\n“No,” said Harry angrily. “Give me my friends’ letters!”\\n“Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,” said the\\nelf sadly.\\nBefore Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the\\nbedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the\\nstairs.\\nMouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him,\\ntrying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six\\nsteps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking\\naround for Dobby. From the dining room he heard\\nUncle Vernon saying, \"... tell Petunia that very funny\\nstory about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason.\\nShe’s been dying to hear ...”\\nHarry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his\\nstomach disappear.\\n \\nAunt Petunia’s masterpiece of a pudding, the\\nmountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating\\nup near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the\\ncorner crouched Dobby.\\n“No,” croaked Harry. “Please ... they’ll kill me. ...”\\n“Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school\\n“Dobby ... please ...”\\n“Say it, sir — ”\\n“I can’t — ”\\nDobby gave him a tragic look.\\n“Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own\\ngood.”\\nThe pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping\\ncrash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the\\ndish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby\\nvanished.\\nThere were screams from the dining room and Uncle\\nVernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with\\nshock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia’s\\npudding.\\nAt first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would\\nmanage to gloss the whole thing over. (“Just our\\nnephew — very disturbed — meeting strangers upsets\\nhim, so we kept him upstairs. ...”) He shooed the\\nshocked Masons back into the dining room, promised\\nHarry he would flay him to within an inch of his life\\nwhen the Masons had left, and handed him a mop.\\nAunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer\\n \\nand Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the\\nkitchen clean.\\nUncle Vernon might still have been able to make his\\ndeal — if it hadn’t been for the owl.\\nAunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-\\ndinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through\\nthe dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs.\\nMason’s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason\\nscreamed like a banshee and ran from the house\\nshouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long\\nenough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally\\nafraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask\\nwhether this was their idea of a joke.\\nHarry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for\\nsupport, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a\\ndemonic glint in his tiny eyes.\\n“Read it!” he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the\\nowl had delivered. “Go on — read it!”\\nHarry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\nWe have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was\\nused at your place of residence this evening at twelve\\nminutes past nine.\\nAs you know, underage wizards are not permitted to\\nperform spells outside school, and further spellwork on\\nyour part may lead to expulsion from said school\\n(Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage\\nSorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).\\nWe would also ask you to remember that any magical\\nactivity that risks notice by members of the non-\\nP a g e | 24 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K.

Slipped\\nyour mind, I daresay. ...”\\nHe was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog,\\nall his teeth bared. “Well, I’ve got news for you, boy. ...\\nI’m locking you up. ... You’re never going back to that\\nschool . . . never . . . and if you try and magic yourself\\nout — they 11 expel you!”\\nAnd laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back\\nupstairs.\\nUncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following\\nmorning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry’s window.\\nHe himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so\\nthat small amounts of food could be pushed inside\\nthree times a day. They let Harry out to use the\\nbathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was\\nlocked in his room around the clock.\\n \\nThree days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign\\nof relenting, and Harry couldn’t see any way out of his\\nsituation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking\\nbehind the bars on the window and wondered\\nmiserably what was going to happen to him.\\nWhat was the good of magicking himself out of his\\nroom if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life\\nat Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that\\nthe Dursleys knew they weren’t going to wake up as\\nfruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might\\nhave saved Harry from horrible happenings at\\nHogwarts, but the way things were going, he’d\\nprobably starve to death anyway.\\nThe cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia’s hand\\nappeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the\\nroom. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger,\\njumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-\\ncold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he\\ncrossed the room to Hedwig’s cage and tipped the\\nsoggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her\\nempty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave\\nhim a look of deep disgust.\\n“It’s no good turning your beak up at it — that’s all\\nwe’ve got,” said Harry grimly.\\nHe put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the\\ncat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even\\nhungrier than he had been before the soup.\\nSupposing he was still alive in another four weeks,\\nwhat would happen if he didn’t turn up at Hogwarts?\\nWould someone be sent to see why he hadn’t come\\nback? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let\\nhim go?\\n \\nThe room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach\\nrumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable\\nquestions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep.\\nHe dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card\\nreading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage.\\nPeople goggled through the bars at him as he lay,\\nstarving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby’s\\nface in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help,\\nbut Dobby called, “Harry Potter is safe there, sir!” and\\nvanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley\\nrattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him.\\n“Stop it,” Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in\\nhis sore head. “Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I’m\\ntrying to sleep. ...”\\nHe opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through\\nthe bars on the window. And someone was goggling\\nthrough the bars at him: a freckle-faced, red-haired,\\nlong-nosed someone.\\nRon Weasley was outside Harry’s window.\\n \\n3\\nTHE BURROW\\n“Ron\\\\” breathed Harry, creeping to the window and\\npushing it up so they could talk through the bars.\\n“Ron, how did you — What the — ?”\\nHarry’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he\\nwas seeing hit him. Ron was leaning out of the back\\nwindow of an old turquoise car, which was parked in\\nmidair. Grinning at Harry from the front seats were\\nFred and George, Ron’s elder twin brothers.\\n“All right, Harry?” asked George.\\n“What’s been going on?” said Ron. “Why haven’t you\\nbeen answering my letters? I’ve asked you to stay\\nabout twelve times, and then Dad came home and\\nsaid you’d got an official warning for using magic in\\nfront of Muggles — ”\\n“It wasn’t me — and how did he know?”\\n“He works for the Ministry,” said Ron. “You know\\nwe’re not supposed to do spells outside school — ”\\n \\n“You should talk,” said Harry, staring at the floating\\ncar.\\n“Oh, this doesn’t count,” said Ron. “We’re only\\nborrowing this. It’s Dad’s, we didn’t enchant it. But\\ndoing magic in front of those Muggles you live with — ”\\n“I told you, I didn’t — but it’ll take too long to explain\\nnow — look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the\\nDursleys have locked me up and won’t let me come\\nback, and obviously I can’t magic myself out, because\\nthe Ministry’ll think that’s the second spell I’ve done\\nin three days, so — ”\\n“Stop gibbering,” said Ron. “We’ve come to take you\\nhome with us.”\\n“But you can’t magic me out either — ”\\n“We don’t need to,” said Ron, jerking his head toward\\nthe front seat and grinning. “You forget who I’ve got\\nwith me.”\\n“Tie that around the bars,” said Fred, throwing the\\nend of a rope to Harry.\\n“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said Harry as he\\ntied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up\\nthe car.\\n“Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.”\\nHarry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig,\\nwho seemed to have realized how important this was\\nand kept still and silent. The car revved louder and\\nlouder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the\\nbars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred\\ndrove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the\\nwindow to see the bars dangling a few feet above the\\n \\nground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car.\\nHarry listened anxiously, but there was no sound\\nfrom the Dursleys’ bedroom.\\nWhen the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron,\\nFred reversed as close as possible to Harry’s window.\\n“Get in,” Ron said.\\n“But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my\\nbroomstick — ”\\n“Where is it?”\\n“Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can’t\\nget out of this room — ”\\n“No problem,” said George from the front passenger\\nseat. “Out of the way, Harry.”\\nFred and George climbed catlike through the window\\ninto Harry’s room. You had to hand it to them,\\nthought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin\\nfrom his pocket and started to pick the lock.\\n“A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing\\nthis sort of Muggle trick,” said Fred, “but we feel\\nthey’re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit\\nslow.”\\nThere was a small click and the door swung open.\\n“So — we’ll get your trunk — you grab anything you\\nneed from your room and hand it out to Ron,”\\nwhispered George.\\n“Watch out for the bottom stair — it creaks,” Harry\\nwhispered back as the twins disappeared onto the\\ndark landing.\\n \\nHarry dashed around his room, collecting his things\\nand passing them out of the window to Ron. Then he\\nwent to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the\\nstairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.\\nAt last, panting, they reached the landing, then\\ncarried the trunk through Harry’s room to the open\\nwindow. Fred climbed back into the car to pull with\\nRon, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom\\nside. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.\\nUncle Vernon coughed again.\\n“A bit more,” panted Fred, who was pulling from\\ninside the car. “One good push — ”\\nHarry and George threw their shoulders against the\\ntrunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat\\nof the car.\\n“Okay, let’s go,” George whispered.\\nBut as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came\\na sudden loud screech from behind him, followed\\nimmediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon’s voice.\\n“THAT RUDDY OWL!”\\n“I’ve forgotten Hedwig!”\\nHarry tore back across the room as the landing light\\nclicked on — he snatched up Hedwig’s cage, dashed\\nto the window, and passed it out to Ron. He was\\nscrambling back onto the chest of drawers when\\nUncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door — and\\nit crashed open.\\n \\nFor a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the\\ndoorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull\\nand dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle.\\nRon, Fred, and George seized Harry’s arms and pulled\\nas hard as they could.\\n“Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon. “He’s getting away!\\nHE’S GETTING AWAY!”\\nBut the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry’s leg\\nslid out of Uncle Vernon’s grasp — Harry was in the\\ncar — he’d slammed the door shut —\\n“Put your foot down, Fred!” yelled Ron, and the car\\nshot suddenly toward the moon.\\nHarry couldn’t believe it — he was free. He rolled\\ndown the window, the night air whipping his hair,\\nand looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet\\nDrive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were\\nall hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry’s window.\\n“See you next summer!” Harry yelled.\\nThe Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled\\nback in his seat, grinning from ear to ear.\\n“Let Hedwig out,” he told Ron. “She can fly behind us.\\nShe hasn’t had a chance to stretch her wings for\\nages.”\\nGeorge handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment\\nlater, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to\\nglide alongside them like a ghost.\\n“So — what’s the story, Harry?” said Ron impatiently.\\n“What’s been happening?”\\n \\nHarry told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d\\ngiven Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding.\\nThere was a long, shocked silence when he had\\nfinished.\\n“Very fishy,” said Fred finally.\\n“Definitely dodgy,” agreed George. “So he wouldn’t\\neven tell you who’s supposed to be plotting all this\\nstuff?”\\n“I don’t think he could,” said Harry. “I told you, every\\ntime he got close to letting something slip, he started\\nbanging his head against the wall.”\\nHe saw Fred and George look at each other.\\n“What, you think he was lying to me?” said Harry.\\n“Well,” said Fred, “put it this way — house-elves have\\ngot powerful magic of their own, but they can’t\\nusually use it without their master’s permission. I\\nreckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back\\nto Hogwarts. Someone’s idea of a joke. Can you think\\nof anyone at school with a grudge against you?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry and Ron together, instantly.\\n“Draco Malfoy,” Harry explained. “He hates me.”\\n“Draco Malfoy?” said George, turning around. “Not\\nLucius Malfoy’s son?”\\n“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said\\nHarry. “Why?”\\n“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He\\nwas a big supporter of You-Know-Who.”\\n \\n“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred,\\ncraning around to look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came\\nback saying he’d never meant any of it. Load of dung\\n— Dad reckons he was right in You-Know- Who’s\\ninner circle.”\\nHarry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family\\nbefore, and they didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy\\nmade Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful,\\nand sensitive boy.\\n“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf.\\n...” said Harry.\\n“Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding\\nfamily, and they’ll be rich,” said Fred.\\n“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to\\ndo the ironing,” said George. “But all we’ve got is a\\nlousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the\\ngarden. House-elves come with big old manors and\\ncastles and places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in\\nour house. ...”\\nHarry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco\\nMalfoy usually had the best of everything, his family\\nwas rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy\\nstrutting around a large manor house. Sending the\\nfamily servant to stop Harry from going back to\\nHogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing\\nMalfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take\\nDobby seriously?\\n“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron. “I\\nwas getting really worried when you didn’t answer\\nany of my letters. I thought it was Errol’s fault at first\\n“Who’s Errol?”\\n \\n“Our owl. He’s ancient. It wouldn’t be the first time\\nhe’d collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow\\nHermes — ”\\n“Who?”\\n“The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was\\nmade prefect,” said Fred from the front.\\n“But Percy wouldn’t lend him to me,” said Ron. “Said\\nhe needed him.”\\n“Percy’s been acting very oddly this summer,” said\\nGeorge, frowning. “And he has been sending a lot of\\nletters and spending a load of time shut up in his\\nroom. ... I mean, there’s only so many times you can\\npolish a prefect badge. ... You’re driving too far west,\\nFred,” he added, pointing at a compass on the\\ndashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel.\\n“So, does your dad know you’ve got the car?” said\\nHarry, guessing the answer.\\n“Er, no,” said Ron, “he had to work tonight. Hopefully\\nwe’ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum\\nnoticing we flew it.”\\n“What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic,\\nanyway?”\\n“He works in the most boring department,” said Ron.\\n“The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.”\\n“The what?”\\n“It’s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-\\nmade, you know, in case they end up back in a\\nMuggle shop or house. Like, last year, some old witch\\ndied and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop.\\n \\nThis Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried\\nto serve her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare —\\nDad was working overtime for weeks.”\\n“What happened?”\\n“The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all\\nover the place and one man ended up in the hospital\\nwith the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. Dad was\\ngoing frantic — it’s only him and an old warlock\\ncalled Perkins in the office — and they had to do\\nMemory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up —\\n“But your dad — this car — ”\\nFred laughed. “Yeah, Dad’s crazy about everything to\\ndo with Muggles; our shed’s full of Muggle stuff. He\\ntakes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back\\ntogether again. If he raided our house he’d have to put\\nhimself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.”\\n“That’s the main road,” said George, peering down\\nthrough the windshield. “We’ll be there in ten\\nminutes. ... Just as well, it’s getting light. ...”\\nA faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to\\nthe east.\\nFred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark\\npatchwork of fields and clumps of trees.\\n“We’re a little way outside the village,” said George.\\n“Ottery St. Catchpole.”\\nLower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a\\nbrilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees.\\n \\n“Touchdown!” said Fred as, with a slight bump, they\\nhit the ground. They had landed next to a\\ntumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked\\nout for the first time at Ron’s house.\\nIt looked as though it had once been a large stone\\npigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and\\nthere until it was several stories high and so crooked\\nit looked as though it were held up by magic (which,\\nHarry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five\\nchimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A\\nlopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance\\nread, THE BURROW. Around the front door lay a\\njumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron.\\nSeveral fat brown chickens were pecking their way\\naround the yard.\\n“It’s not much,” said Ron.\\n“It’s wonderful,” said Harry happily, thinking of Privet\\nDrive.\\nThey got out of the car.\\n“Now, we’ll go upstairs really quietly,” said Fred, “and\\nwait for Mum to call us for breakfast. Then, Ron, you\\ncome bounding downstairs going, ‘Mum, look who\\nturned up in the night!’ and she’ll be all pleased to\\nsee Harry and no one need ever know we flew the\\ncar.”\\n“Right,” said Ron. “Come on, Harry, I sleep at the —\\nat the top — ”\\nRon had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on\\nthe house. The other three wheeled around.\\nMrs. Weasley was marching across the yard,\\nscattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-\\nP a g e | 37 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling\\nfaced woman, it was remarkable how much she\\nlooked like a saber-toothed tiger.\\n“Ah,” said Fred.\\n“Oh, dear,” said George.\\nMrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her\\nhands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the\\nnext. She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand\\nsticking out of the pocket.\\n“So,” she said.\\n“ ’Morning, Mum,” said George, in what he clearly\\nthought was a jaunty, winning voice.\\n“Have you any idea how worried I’ve been?” said Mrs.\\nWeasley in a deadly whisper.\\n“Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to — ”\\nAll three of Mrs. Weasley’s sons were taller than she\\nwas, but they cowered as her rage broke over them.\\n“Beds empty\\\\ No note\\\\ Car gone — could have crashed\\n— out of my mind with worry — did you care? —\\nnever, as long as I’ve lived — you wait until your father\\ngets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or\\nCharlie or Percy — ”\\n“Perfect Percy,” muttered Fred.\\n“YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF\\nPERCY’S BOOK!” yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a\\nfinger in Fred’s chest. “You could havedied, you could\\nhave been seen, you could have lost your father his\\njob\\n \\nIt seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had\\nshouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry,\\nwho backed away.\\n“I’m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,” she said.\\n“Come in and have some breakfast.”\\nShe turned and walked back into the house and\\nHarry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded\\nencouragingly, followed her.\\nThe kitchen was small and rather cramped. There\\nwas a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the\\nmiddle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat,\\nlooking around. He had never been in a wizard house\\nbefore.\\nThe clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand\\nand no numbers at all. Written around the edge were\\nthings like Time to make tea, Time to feed the\\nchickens, and You’re late. Books were stacked three\\ndeep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm\\nYour Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One\\nMinute Feasts — It’s Magid And unless Harry’s ears\\nwere deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had\\njust announced that coming up was “Witching Hour,\\nwith the popular singing sorceress, Celestina\\nWarbeck.”\\nMrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking\\nbreakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at\\nher sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan.\\nEvery now and then she muttered things like “don’t\\nknow what you were thinking of,” and “never would\\nhave believed it.”\\n“I don’t blame you, dear,” she assured Harry, tipping\\neight or nine sausages onto his plate. “Arthur and I\\nhave been worried about you, too. Just last night we\\n \\nwere saying we’d come and get you ourselves if you\\nhadn’t written back to Ron by Friday. But really” (she\\nwas now adding three fried eggs to his plate), “flying\\nan illegal car halfway across the country — anyone\\ncould have seen you — ”\\nShe flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the\\nsink, which began to clean themselves, clinking\\ngently in the background.\\n“It was cloudy, Mum!” said Fred.\\n“You keep your mouth closed while you’re eating!”\\nMrs. Weasley snapped.\\n“They were starving him, Mum!” said George.\\n“And you!” said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a\\nslightly softened expression that she started cutting\\nHarry bread and buttering it for him.\\nAt that moment there was a diversion in the form of a\\nsmall, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who\\nappeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran\\nout again.\\n“Ginny,” said Ron in an undertone to Harry. “My\\nsister. She’s been talking about you all summer.”\\n“Yeah, she’ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,” Fred\\nsaid with a grin, but he caught his mother’s eye and\\nbent his face over his plate without another word.\\nNothing more was said until all four plates were\\nclean, which took a surprisingly short time.\\n“Blimey, I’m tired,” yawned Fred, setting down his\\nknife and fork at last. “I think I’ll go to bed and — ”\\n \\n“You will not,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “It’s your own\\nfault you’ve been up all night. You’re going to de-\\ngnome the garden for me; they’re getting completely\\nout of hand again — ”\\n“Oh, Mum — ”\\n“And you two,” she said, glaring at Ron and Fred.\\n“You can go up to bed, dear,” she added to Harry.\\n“You didn’t ask them to fly that wretched car — ”\\nBut Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, “I’ll help\\nRon. I’ve never seen a de-gnoming — ”\\n“That’s very sweet of you, dear, but it’s dull work,”\\nsaid Mrs. Weasley. “Now, let’s see what Lockhart’s got\\nto say on the subject — ”\\nAnd she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the\\nmantelpiece. George groaned.\\n“Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden — ”\\nHarry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley’s book.\\nWritten across it in fancy gold letters were the words\\nGilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests. There\\nwas a big photograph on the front of a very good-\\nlooking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue\\neyes. As always in the wizarding world, the\\nphotograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry\\nsupposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking\\ncheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down\\nat him.\\n“Oh, he is marvelous,” she said. “He knows his\\nhousehold pests, all right, it’s a wonderful book. ...”\\n“Mum fancies him,” said Fred, in a very audible\\nwhisper.\\n \\n“Don’t be so ridiculous, Fred,” said Mrs. Weasley, her\\ncheeks rather pink. “All right, if you think you know\\nbetter than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it,\\nand woe betide you if there’s a single gnome in that\\ngarden when I come out to inspect it.”\\nYawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched\\noutside with Harry behind them. The garden was\\nlarge, and in Harry’s eyes, exactly what a garden\\nshould be. The Dursleys wouldn’t have liked it —\\nthere were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed\\ncutting — but there were gnarled trees all around the\\nwalls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every\\nflower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.\\n“Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,” Harry\\ntold Ron as they crossed the lawn.\\n“Yeah, I’ve seen those things they think are gnomes,”\\nsaid Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush,\\n“like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods. ...”\\nThere was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush\\nshuddered, and Ron straightened up. “ This is a\\ngnome,” he said grimly.\\n“Gerroff me! Gerroff me!” squealed the gnome.\\nIt was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small\\nand leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head\\nexactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm’s length as it\\nkicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped\\nit around the ankles and turned it upside down.\\n“This is what you have to do,” he said. He raised the\\ngnome above his head (“Gerroff me!”) and started to\\nswing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the\\nshocked look on Harry’s face, Ron added, “It doesn’t\\n \\nhurt them — you’ve just got to make them really dizzy\\nso they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes.”\\nHe let go of the gnome’s ankles: It flew twenty feet\\ninto the air and landed with a thud in the field over\\nthe hedge.\\n“Pitiful,” said Fred. “I bet I can get mine beyond that\\nstump.”\\nHarry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the\\ngnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he\\ncaught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing\\nweakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry’s\\nfinger and he had a hard job shaking it off — until —\\n“Wow, Harry — that must’ve been fifty feet. ...”\\nThe air was soon thick with flying gnomes.\\n“See, they’re not too bright,” said George, seizing five\\nor six gnomes at once. “The moment they know the\\nde-gnoming’s going on they storm up to have a look.\\nYou’d think they’d have learned by now just to stay\\nput.”\\nSoon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking\\naway in a straggling line, their little shoulders\\nhunched.\\n“They’ll be back,” said Ron as they watched the\\ngnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of\\nthe field. “They love it here. ... Dad’s too soft with\\nthem; he thinks they’re funny. ...”\\nJust then, the front door slammed.\\n“He’s back!” said George. “Dad’s home!”\\n \\nThey hurried through the garden and back into the\\nhouse.\\nMr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his\\nglasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man,\\ngoing bald, but the little hair he had was as red as\\nany of his children’s. He was wearing long green\\nrobes, which were dusty and travel-worn.\\n“What a night,” he mumbled, groping for the teapot as\\nthey all sat down around him. “Nine raids. Nine! And\\nold Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me\\nwhen I had my back turned. ...”\\nMr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.\\n“Find anything, Dad?” said Fred eagerly.\\n“All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting\\nkettle,” yawned Mr. Weasley. “There was some pretty\\nnasty stuff that wasn’t my department, though.\\nMortlake was taken away for questioning about some\\nextremely odd ferrets, but that’s the Committee on\\nExperimental Charms, thank goodness. ...”\\n“Why would anyone bother making door keys\\nshrink?” said George.\\n“Just Muggle-baiting,” sighed Mr. Weasley. “Sell them\\na key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can\\nnever find it when they need it. ... Of course, it’s very\\nhard to convict anyone because no Muggle would\\nadmit their key keeps shrinking — they’ll insist they\\njust keep losing it. Bless them, they’ll go to any\\nlengths to ignore magic, even if it’s staring them in\\nthe face. ... But the things our lot have taken to\\nenchanting, you wouldn’t believe — ”\\n“LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?”\\n \\nMrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like\\na sword. Mr. Weasley’s eyes jerked open. He stared\\nguiltily at his wife.\\n“C-cars, Molly, dear?”\\n“Yes, Arthur, cars,” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes\\nflashing. “Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and\\ntelling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it\\napart to see how it worked, while really he was\\nenchanting it to make it fly.”\\nMr. Weasley blinked.\\n“Well, dear, I think you’ll find that he would be quite\\nwithin the law to do that, even if — er — he maybe\\nwould have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth.\\n... There’s a loophole in the law, you’ll find. ... As long\\nas he wasn’t intending to fly the car, the fact that the\\ncar could fly wouldn’t — ”\\n“Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole\\nwhen you wrote that law!” shouted Mrs. Weasley.\\n“Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that\\nMuggle rubbish in your shed! And for your\\ninformation, Harry arrived this morning in the car\\nyou weren’t intending to fly!”\\n“Harry?” said Mr. Weasley blankly. “Harry who?”\\nHe looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.\\n“Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet\\nyou, Ron’s told us so much about — ”\\n“ Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back\\nlast nighti” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “What have you got\\nto say about that, eh?”\\n \\n“Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Did it go\\nall right? I — I mean,” he faltered as sparks flew from\\nMrs. Weasley’s eyes, “that — that was very wrong,\\nboys — very wrong indeed. ...”\\n“Let’s leave them to it,” Ron muttered to Harry as\\nMrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. “Come on, I’ll\\nshow you my bedroom.”\\nThey slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow\\npassageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its\\nway, zigzagging up through the house. On the third\\nlanding, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of\\na pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it\\nclosed with a snap.\\n“Ginny,” said Ron. “You don’t know how weird it is for\\nher to be this shy. She never shuts up normally — ”\\nThey climbed two more flights until they reached a\\ndoor with peeling paint and a small plaque on it,\\nsaying RONALD’S ROOM.\\nHarry stepped in, his head almost touching the\\nsloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a\\nfurnace: Nearly everything in Ron’s room seemed to\\nbe a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls,\\neven the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had\\ncovered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper\\nwith posters of the same seven witches and wizards,\\nall wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks,\\nand waving energetically.\\n“Your Quidditch team?” said Harry.\\n“The Chudley Cannons,” said Ron, pointing at the\\norange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two\\ngiant black C’s and a speeding cannonball. “Ninth in\\nthe league.”\\n \\nRon’s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a\\ncorner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to\\nfeature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad\\nMuggle. Ron’s magic wand was lying on top of a fish\\ntank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his\\nfat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of\\nsun.\\nHarry stepped over a pack of Self- Shuffling playing\\ncards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window.\\nIn the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes\\nsneaking one by one back through the Weasleys’\\nhedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was\\nwatching him almost nervously, as though waiting for\\nhis opinion.\\n“It’s a bit small,” said Ron quickly. “Not like that room\\nyou had with the Muggles. And I’m right underneath\\nthe ghoul in the attic; he’s always banging on the\\npipes and groaning. ...”\\nBut Harry, grinning widely, said, “This is the best\\nhouse I’ve ever been in.”\\nRon’s ears went pink.\\n \\nAT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS\\nLife at the Burrow was as different as possible from\\nlife on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything\\nneat and ordered; the Weasleys’ house burst with the\\nstrange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first\\ntime he looked in the mirror over the kitchen\\nmantelpiece and it shouted, “ Tuck your shirt in,\\nscruff yV’ The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped\\npipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet,\\nand small explosions from Fred and George’s\\nbedroom were considered perfectly normal. What\\nHarry found most unusual about life at Ron’s,\\nhowever, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking\\nghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to\\nlike him.\\nMrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and\\ntried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal.\\nMr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the\\ndinner table so that he could bombard him with\\nquestions about life with Muggles, asking him to\\nexplain how things like plugs and the postal service\\nworked.\\n \\n“ Fascinating !” he would say as Harry talked him\\nthrough using a telephone. “Ingenious, really, how\\nmany ways Muggles have found of getting along\\nwithout magic.”\\nHarry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about\\na week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and\\nRon went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs.\\nWeasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen\\ntable. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally\\nknocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud\\nclatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things\\nover whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under\\nthe table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her\\nface glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn’t\\nnoticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs.\\nWeasley offered him.\\n“Letters from school,” said Mr. Weasley, passing\\nHarry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish\\nparchment, addressed in green ink. “Dumbledore\\nalready knows you’re here, Harry — doesn’t miss a\\ntrick, that man. You two’ve got them, too,” he added,\\nas Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas.\\nFor a few minutes there was silence as they all read\\ntheir letters. Harry’s told him to catch the Hogwarts\\nExpress as usual from King’s Cross station on\\nSeptember first. There was also a list of the new\\nbooks he’d need for the coming year.\\nSECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:\\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda\\nGoshawk\\nBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart\\nGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart\\n \\nHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart\\nTravels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart\\nVoyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart\\nWanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart\\nYear with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart\\nFred, who had finished his own list, peered over at\\nHarry’s.\\n“You’ve been told to get all Lockhart’s books, too!” he\\nsaid. “The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher\\nmust be a fan — bet it’s a witch.”\\nAt this point, Fred caught his mother’s eye and\\nquickly busied himself with the marmalade.\\n“That lot won’t come cheap,” said George, with a\\nquick look at his parents. “Lockhart’s books are really\\nexpensive. ...”\\n“Well, we’ll manage,” said Mrs. Weasley, but she\\nlooked worried. “I expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot\\nof Ginny’s things secondhand.”\\n“Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?” Harry\\nasked Ginny.\\nShe nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair,\\nand put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no\\none saw this except Harry, because just then Ron’s\\nelder brother Percy walked in. He was already\\ndressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his\\nsweater vest.\\n“Morning, all,” said Percy briskly. “Lovely day.”\\n \\nHe sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up\\nagain almost immediately, pulling from underneath\\nhim a molting, gray feather duster — at least, that\\nwas what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it\\nwas breathing.\\n“Errol!” said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and\\nextracting a letter from under its wing. “Finally — he’s\\ngot Hermione’s answer. I wrote to her saying we were\\ngoing to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.”\\nHe carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door\\nand tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped\\nstraight off again so Ron laid him on the draining\\nboard instead, muttering, “Pathetic.” Then he ripped\\nopen Hermione’s letter and read it out loud:\\n“ ‘Dear Ron, and Harry if you’re there,\\n“ ‘I hope everything went all right and that Harry is\\nokay and that you didn’t do anything illegal to get him\\nout, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble,\\ntoo. I’ve been really worried and if Harry is all right,\\nwill you please let me know at once, but perhaps it\\nwould be better if you used a different owl, because I\\nthink another delivery might finish your one off\\n“ ‘I’m very busy with schoolwork, of course’ — How can\\nshe be?” said Ron in horror. “We’re on vacation! —\\n‘and we’re going to London next Wednesday to buy my\\nnew books. Why don’t we meet in Diagon Alley?\\n“ ‘Let me know what’s happening as soon as you can.\\nLove from Hermione.’ ”\\n“Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your\\nthings then, too,” said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear\\nthe table. “What ’re you all up to today?”\\n \\nHarry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up\\nthe hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It\\nwas surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of\\nthe village below, meaning that they could practice\\nQuidditch there, as long as they didn’t fly too high.\\nThey couldn’t use real Quidditch balls, which would\\nhave been hard to explain if they had escaped and\\nflown away over the village; instead they threw apples\\nfor one another to catch. They took turns riding\\nHarry’s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the\\nbest broom; Ron’s old Shooting Star was often\\noutstripped by passing butterflies.\\nFive minutes later they were marching up the hill,\\nbroomsticks over their shoulders. They had asked\\nPercy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he\\nwas busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so\\nfar; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.\\n“Wish I knew what he was up to,” said Fred, frowning.\\n“He’s not himself. His exam results came the day\\nbefore you did; twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated\\nat all.”\\n“Ordinary Wizarding Levels,” George explained, seeing\\nHarry’s puzzled look. “Bill got twelve, too. If we’re not\\ncareful, we’ll have another Head Boy in the family. I\\ndon’t think I could stand the shame.”\\nBill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next\\nbrother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry\\nhad never met either of them, but knew that Charlie\\nwas in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt\\nworking for the wizard’s bank, Gringotts.\\n“Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our\\nschool stuff this year,” said George after a while. “Five\\nsets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a\\nwand and everything. ...”\\n \\nHarry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in\\nan underground vault at Gringotts in London was a\\nsmall fortune that his parents had left him. Of course,\\nit was only in the wizarding world that he had money;\\nyou couldn’t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in\\nMuggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts\\nbank account to the Dursleys; he didn’t think their\\nhorror of anything connected with magic would\\nstretch to a large pile of gold.\\nMrs. Weasley woke them all early the following\\nWednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon\\nsandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs.\\nWeasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece\\nand peered inside.\\n“We’re running low, Arthur,” she sighed. “We’ll have\\nto buy some more today. ... Ah well, guests first! After\\nyou, Harry dear!”\\nAnd she offered him the flowerpot.\\nHarry stared at them all watching him.\\n“W-what am I supposed to do?” he stammered.\\n“He’s never traveled by Floo powder,” said Ron\\nsuddenly. “Sorry, Harry, I forgot.”\\n“Never?” said Mr. Weasley. “But how did you get to\\nDiagon Alley to buy your school things last year?”\\n“I went on the Underground — ”\\n“Really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Were there\\nescapators? How exactly — ”\\n \\n“Not now, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Floo powder’s\\na lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you’ve never\\nused it before — ”\\n“He’ll be all right, Mum,” said Fred. “Harry, watch us\\nfirst.”\\nHe took a pinch of glittering powder out of the\\nflowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the\\npowder into the flames.\\nWith a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose\\nhigher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted,\\n“Diagon Alley!” and vanished.\\n“You must speak clearly, dear,” Mrs. Weasley told\\nHarry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot.\\n“And be sure to get out at the right grate. ...”\\n“The right what?” said Harry nervously as the fire\\nroared and whipped George out of sight, too.\\n“Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose\\nfrom, you know, but as long as you’ve spoken clearly\\n“He’ll be fine, Molly, don’t fuss,” said Mr. Weasley,\\nhelping himself to Floo powder, too.\\n“But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain\\nto his aunt and uncle?”\\n“They wouldn’t mind,” Harry reassured her. “Dudley\\nwould think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a\\nchimney, don’t worry about that — ”\\n“Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,” said Mrs.\\nWeasley. “Now, when you get into the fire, say where\\nyou’re going — ”\\n \\n“And keep your elbows tucked in,” Ron advised.\\n“And your eyes shut,” said Mrs. Weasley. “The soot —\\n“Don’t fidget,” said Ron. “Or you might well fall out of\\nthe wrong fireplace — ”\\n“But don’t panic and get out too early; wait until you\\nsee Fred and George.”\\nTrying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a\\npinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the\\nfire. He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into\\nthe flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a\\nwarm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately\\nswallowed a lot of hot ash.\\n“D-Dia-gon Alley,” he coughed.\\nIt felt as though he were being sucked down a giant\\ndrain. He seemed to be spinning very fast — the\\nroaring in his ears was deafening — he tried to keep\\nhis eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him\\nfeel sick — something hard knocked his elbow and he\\ntucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning — now\\nit felt as though cold hands were slapping his face —\\nsquinting through his glasses he saw a blurred\\nstream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the\\nrooms beyond — his bacon sandwiches were\\nchurning inside him — he closed his eyes again\\nwishing it would stop, and then —\\nHe fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the\\nbridge of his glasses snap.\\nDizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to\\nhis feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He\\nwas quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea.\\n \\nAll he could tell was that he was standing in the stone\\nfireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard’s\\nshop — but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a\\nHogwarts school list.\\nA glass case nearby held a withered hand on a\\ncushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring\\nglass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the\\nwalls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the\\ncounter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from\\nthe ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry\\ncould see through the dusty shop window was\\ndefinitely not Diagon Alley.\\nThe sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still\\nstinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his\\nway swiftly and silently toward the door, but before\\nhe’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on\\nthe other side of the glass — and one of them was the\\nvery last person Harry wanted to meet when he was\\nlost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses:\\nDraco Malfoy.\\nHarry looked quickly around and spotted a large\\nblack cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled\\nthe doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer\\nthrough. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy\\nstepped into the shop.\\nThe man who followed could only be Draco’s father.\\nHe had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold,\\ngray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily\\nat the items on display, and rang a bell on the\\ncounter before turning to his son and saying, “Touch\\nnothing, Draco.”\\nMalfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I\\nthought you were going to buy me a present.”\\n \\n“I said I would buy you a racing broom,” said his\\nfather, drumming his fingers on the counter.\\n“What’s the good of that if I’m not on the House\\nteam?” said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered.\\n“Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year.\\nSpecial permission from Dumbledore so he could play\\nfor Gryffindor. He’s not even that good, it’s just\\nbecause he’s famous ... famous for having a stupid\\nscar on his forehead. ...”\\nMalfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.\\n\"... everyone thinks he’s so smart, wonderful Potter\\nwith his scar and his broomstick — ”\\n“You have told me this at least a dozen times\\nalready,” said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his\\nson. “And I would remind you that it is not — prudent\\n— to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when\\nmost of our kind regard him as the hero who made\\nthe Dark Lord disappear — ah, Mr. Borgin.”\\nA stooping man had appeared behind the counter,\\nsmoothing his greasy hair back from his face.\\n“Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” said\\nMr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. “Delighted —\\nand young Master Malfoy, too — charmed. How may I\\nbe of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and\\nvery reasonably priced — ”\\n“I’m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,” said\\nMr. Malfoy.\\n“Selling?” The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin ’s\\nface.\\n \\n“You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is\\nconducting more raids,” said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll\\nof parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it\\nfor Mr. Borgin to read. “I have a few — ah — items at\\nhome that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were\\nto call. ...”\\nMr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and\\nlooked down the list.\\n“The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir,\\nsurely?”\\nMr. Malfoy’s lip curled.\\n“I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still\\ncommands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows\\never more meddlesome. There are rumors about a\\nnew Muggle Protection Act — no doubt that flea-\\nbitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it\\nHarry felt a hot surge of anger.\\n“ — and as you see, certain of these poisons might\\nmake it appear — ”\\n“I understand, sir, of course,” said Mr. Borgin. “Let\\nme see ...”\\n“Can I have that?” interrupted Draco, pointing at the\\nwithered hand on its cushion.\\n“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr. Borgin, abandoning\\nMr. Malfoy’s list and scurrying over to Draco. “Insert a\\ncandle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend\\nof thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste,\\nsir.”\\n \\n“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a\\nplunderer, Borgin,” said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr.\\nBorgin said quickly, “No offense, sir, no offense meant\\n“Though if his grades don’t pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy,\\nmore coldly still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for\\n“It’s not my fault,” retorted Draco. “The teachers all\\nhave favorites, that Hermione Granger — ”\\n“I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of\\nno wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped\\nMr. Malfoy.\\n“Ha!” said Harry under his breath, pleased to see\\nDraco looking both abashed and angry.\\n“It’s the same all over,” said Mr. Borgin, in his oily\\nvoice. “Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere —\\n“Not with me,” said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils\\nflaring.\\n“No, sir, nor with me, sir,” said Mr. Borgin, with a\\ndeep bow.\\n“In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,” said\\nMr. Malfoy shortly. “I am in something of a hurry,\\nBorgin, I have important business elsewhere today — ”\\nThey started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as\\nDraco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place,\\nexamining the objects for sale. Draco paused to\\nexamine a long coil of hangman’s rope and to read,\\nsmirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace\\n \\nof opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed — Has\\nClaimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.\\nDraco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front\\nof him. He walked forward — he stretched out his\\nhand for the handle —\\n“Done,” said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. “Come, Draco\\nHarry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco\\nturned away.\\n“Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. Ill expect you at the\\nmanor tomorrow to pick up the goods.”\\nThe moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped\\nhis oily manner.\\n“Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories\\nare true, you haven’t sold me half of what’s hidden in\\nyour manor. ...”\\nMuttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back\\nroom. Harry waited for a minute in case he came\\nback, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the\\ncabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop\\ndoor.\\nClutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared\\naround. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that\\nseemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the\\nDark Arts. The one he’d just left, Borgin and Burkes,\\nlooked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty\\nwindow display of shrunken heads and, two doors\\ndown, a large cage was alive with gigantic black\\nspiders. Two shab by-looking wizards were watching\\nhim from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each\\nother. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his\\n \\nglasses on straight and hoping against hope he’d be\\nable to find a way out of here.\\nAn old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling\\npoisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn\\nAlley. This didn’t help, as Harry had never heard of\\nsuch a place. He supposed he hadn’t spoken clearly\\nenough through his mouthful of ashes back in the\\nWeasleys’ fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what\\nto do.\\n“Not lost are you, my dear?” said a voice in his ear,\\nmaking him jump.\\nAn aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of\\nwhat looked horribly like whole human fingernails.\\nShe leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry\\nbacked away.\\n“I’m fine, thanks,” he said. “I’m just — ”\\n“HARRY! What d’yeh think yer doin’ down there?”\\nHarry’s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of\\nfingernails cascaded down over her feet and she\\ncursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts\\ngamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black\\neyes flashing over his great bristling beard.\\n“Hagrid!” Harry croaked in relief. “I was lost — Floo\\npowder — ”\\nHagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and\\npulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray\\nright out of her hands. Her shrieks followed them all\\nthe way along the twisting alleyway out into bright\\nsunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble\\nbuilding in the distance — Gringotts Bank. Hagrid\\nhad steered him right into Diagon Alley.\\n \\n“Yer a mess!” said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off\\nHarry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a\\nbarrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary.\\n“Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno — dodgy\\nplace, Harry — don’ want no one ter see yeh down\\nthere — ”\\n“I realized that,” said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made\\nto brush him off again. “I told you, I was lost — what\\nwere you doing down there, anyway?”\\n“ I was lookin’ fer a Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent,”\\ngrowled Hagrid. “They’re ruinin’ the school cabbages.\\nYer not on yer own?”\\n“I’m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,”\\nHarry explained. “I’ve got to go and find them. ...”\\nThey set off together down the street.\\n“How come yeh never wrote back ter me?” said Hagrid\\nas Harry jogged alongside him (he had to take three\\nsteps to every stride of Hagrid ’s enormous boots).\\nHarry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys.\\n“Lousy Muggles,” growled Hagrid. “If I’d’ve known — ”\\n“Harry! Harry! Over here!”\\nHarry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing\\nat the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She\\nran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying\\nbehind her.\\n“What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid — Oh,\\nit’s wonderful to see you two again — Are you coming\\ninto Gringotts, Harry?”\\n“As soon as I’ve found the Weasleys,” said Harry.\\n \\n“Yeh won’t have long ter wait,” Hagrid said with a\\ngrin.\\nHarry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the\\ncrowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and\\nMr. Weasley.\\n“Harry,” Mr. Weasley panted. “We hoped you’d only\\ngone one grate too far. ...” He mopped his glistening\\nbald patch. “Molly’s frantic — she’s coming now — ”\\n“Where did you come out?” Ron asked.\\n“Knockturn Alley,” said Hagrid grimly.\\n“Excellent.” said Fred and George together.\\n“We’ve never been allowed in,” said Ron enviously.\\n“I should ruddy well think not,” growled Hagrid.\\nMrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her\\nhandbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginny just\\nclinging onto the other.\\n“Oh, Harry — oh, my dear — you could have been\\nanywhere — ”\\nGasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush\\nout of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid\\nhadn’t managed to beat away. Mr. Weasley took\\nHarry’s glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and\\nreturned them, good as new.\\n“Well, gotta be off,” said Hagrid, who was having his\\nhand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (“Knockturn Alley! If you\\nhadn’t found him, Hagrid!”). “See yer at Hogwarts!”\\nAnd he strode away, head and shoulders taller than\\nanyone else in the packed street.\\n \\n“Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?” Harry\\nasked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the\\nGringotts steps. “Malfoy and his father.”\\n“Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?” said Mr. Weasley\\nsharply behind them.\\n“No, he was selling — ”\\n“So he’s worried,” said Mr. Weasley with grim\\nsatisfaction. “Oh, I’d love to get Lucius Malfoy for\\nsomething. ...”\\n“You be careful, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply\\nas they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the\\ndoor. “That family’s trouble. Don’t go biting off more\\nthan you can chew — ”\\n“So you don’t think I’m a match for Lucius Malfoy?”\\nsaid Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted\\nalmost at once by the sight of Hermione’s parents,\\nwho were standing nervously at the counter that ran\\nall along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione\\nto introduce them.\\n“But you’re Mugglesl” said Mr. Weasley delightedly.\\n“We must have a drink! What’s that you’ve got there?\\nOh, you’re changing Muggle money. Molly, look!” He\\npointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr.\\nGranger’s hand.\\n“Meet you back here,” Ron said to Hermione as the\\nWeasleys and Harry were led off to their underground\\nvaults by another Gringotts goblin.\\nThe vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-\\ndriven carts that sped along minature train tracks\\nthrough the bank’s underground tunnels. Harry\\nenjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys’\\n \\nvault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in\\nKnock- turn Alley, when it was opened. There was a\\nvery small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one\\ngold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners\\nbefore sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt\\neven worse when they reached his vault. He tried to\\nblock the contents from view as he hastily shoved\\nhandfuls of coins into a leather bag.\\nBack outside on the marble steps, they all separated.\\nPercy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill.\\nFred and George had spotted their friend from\\nHogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were\\ngoing to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was\\ninsisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky\\nCauldron for a drink.\\n“Well all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to\\nbuy your schoolbooks,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting off\\nwith Ginny. “And not one step down Knockturn\\nAlley!” she shouted at the twins’ retreating backs.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the\\nwinding, cobbled street. The bag of gold, silver, and\\nbronze jangling cheerfully in Harry’s pocket was\\nclamoring to be spent, so he bought three large\\nstrawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they\\nslurped happily as they wandered up the alley,\\nexamining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed\\nlongingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the\\nwindows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until\\nHermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment\\nnext door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke\\nShop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who\\nwere stocking up on Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet-\\nStart, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full\\nof broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old\\ncloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy,\\n \\ndeeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book\\ncalled Prefects Who Gained Power.\\n“A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers,”\\nRon read aloud off the back cover. “That sounds\\nfascinating. ...”\\n“Go away,” Percy snapped.\\n“ ’Course, he’s very ambitious, Percy, he’s got it all\\nplanned out. ... He wants to be Minister of Magic ...”\\nRon told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they\\nleft Percy to it.\\nAn hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts.\\nThey were by no means the only ones making their\\nway to the bookshop. As they approached it, they saw\\nto their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the\\ndoors, trying to get in. The reason for this was\\nproclaimed by a large banner stretched across the\\nupper windows:\\nGILDEROY LOCKHART\\nwill be signing copies of his autobiography\\nMAGICAL ME\\ntoday 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.\\n“We can actually meet him!” Hermione squealed. “I\\nmean, he’s written almost the whole booklist!”\\nThe crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches\\naround Mrs. Weasley’s age. A harassed-looking wizard\\nstood at the door, saying, “Calmly, please, ladies. ...\\nDon’t push, there ... mind the books, now. ...”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long\\nline wound right to the back of the shop, where\\nGilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They each\\n \\ngrabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade\\n2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the\\nWeasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.\\n“Oh, there you are, good,” said Mrs. Weasley. She\\nsounded breathless and kept patting her hair. “Well\\nbe able to see him in a minute. ...”\\nGilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a\\ntable surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all\\nwinking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the\\ncrowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-\\nme-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his\\npointed wizard’s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his\\nwavy hair.\\nA short, irritable-looking man was dancing around\\ntaking photographs with a large black camera that\\nemitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding\\nflash.\\n“Out of the way, there,” he snarled at Ron, moving\\nback to get a better shot. “This is for the Daily Prophet\\n“Big deal,” said Ron, rubbing his foot where the\\nphotographer had stepped on it.\\nGilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw\\nRon — and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he\\nleapt to his feet and positively shouted, “It can’t be\\nHarry Potter?”\\nThe crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart\\ndived forward, seized Harry’s arm, and pulled him to\\nthe front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry’s face\\nburned as Lockhart shook his hand for the\\nphotographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting\\nthick smoke over the Weasleys.\\n \\n“Nice big smile, Harry,” said Lockhart, through his\\nown gleaming teeth. “Together, you and I are worth\\nthe front page.”\\nWhen he finally let go of Harry’s hand, Harry could\\nhardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle back over to\\nthe Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his\\nshoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.\\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said loudly, waving for\\nquiet. “What an extraordinary moment this is! The\\nperfect moment for me to make a little announcement\\nI’ve been sitting on for some time!\\n“When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and\\nBlotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography\\n— which I shall be happy to present him now, free of\\ncharge — ” The crowd applauded again. “He had no\\nidea,” Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake\\nthat made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, “that\\nhe would shortly be getting much, much more than\\nmy book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in\\nfact, be getting the real magical me. Yes, ladies and\\ngentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in\\nannouncing that this September, I will be taking up\\nthe post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at\\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”\\nThe crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found\\nhimself being presented with the entire works of\\nGilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their\\nweight, he managed to make his way out of the\\nlimelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was\\nstanding next to her new cauldron.\\n“You have these,” Harry mumbled to her, tipping the\\nbooks into the cauldron. “I’ll buy my own — ”\\n \\n“Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” said a voice\\nHarry had no trouble recognizing. He straightened up\\nand found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy,\\nwho was wearing his usual sneer.\\n“Famous Harry Potter,” said Malfoy. “Can’t even go\\ninto a bookshop without making the front page.”\\n“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny.\\nIt was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry.\\nShe was glaring at Malfoy.\\n“Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend).” drawled\\nMalfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione\\nfought their way over, both clutching stacks of\\nLockhart’s books.\\n“Oh, it’s you,” said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he\\nwere something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe.\\n“Bet you’re surprised to see Harry here, eh?”\\n“Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop,\\nWeasley,” retorted Malfoy. “I suppose your parents\\nwill go hungry for a month to pay for all those.”\\nRon went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into\\nthe cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but\\nHarry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket.\\n“Ron!” said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred\\nand George. “What are you doing? It’s too crowded in\\nhere, let’s go outside.”\\n“Well, well, well — Arthur Weasley.”\\nIt was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco’s\\nshoulder, sneering in just the same way.\\n“Lucius,” said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.\\n \\n“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr. Malfoy.\\n“All those raids ... I hope they’re paying you\\novertime?”\\nHe reached into Ginny’s cauldron and extracted, from\\namid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very\\nbattered copy of A Beginner’s Guide to Transfiguration.\\n“Obviously not,” Mr. Malfoy said. “Dear me, what’s\\nthe use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if\\nthey don’t even pay you well for it?”\\nMr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.\\n“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the\\nname of wizard, Malfoy,” he said.\\n“Clearly,” said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to\\nMr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching\\napprehensively. “The company you keep, Weasley ...\\nand I thought your family could sink no lower — ”\\nThere was a thud of metal as Ginny’s cauldron went\\nflying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy,\\nknocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of\\nheavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their\\nheads; there was a yell of, “Get him, Dad!” from Fred\\nor George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, “No, Arthur,\\nno!”; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more\\nshelves over; “Gentlemen, please — please!” cried the\\nassistant, and then, louder than all —\\n“Break it up, there, gents, break it up — ”\\nHagrid was wading toward them through the sea of\\nbooks. In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and\\nMr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr.\\nMalfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of\\nToadstools. He was still holding Ginny’s old\\n \\nTransfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes\\nglittering with malice.\\n“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your\\nfather can give you — ” Pulling himself out of Hagrid’s\\ngrip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.\\n“Yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur,” said Hagrid,\\nalmost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he\\nstraightened his robes. “Rotten ter the core, the whole\\nfamily, everyone knows that — no Malfoy’s worth\\nlistenin’ ter — bad blood, that’s what it is — come on\\nnow — let’s get outta here.”\\nThe assistant looked as though he wanted to stop\\nthem from leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid’s\\nwaist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried\\nup the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and\\nMrs. Weasley beside herself with fury.\\n“A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in\\npublic ... what Gilderoy Lockhart must’ve thought — ”\\n“He was pleased,” said Fred. “Didn’t you hear him as\\nwe were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the\\nDaily Prophet if he’d be able to work the fight into his\\nreport — said it was all publicity — ”\\nBut it was a subdued group that headed back to the\\nfireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the\\nWeasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling\\nback to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said\\ngood-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub\\nfor the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley\\nstarted to ask them how bus stops worked, but\\nstopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley’s face.\\n \\nHarry took off his glasses and put them safely in his\\npocket before helping himself to Floo powder. It\\ndefinitely wasn’t his favorite way to travel.\\n \\n5\\nTHE WHOMPING WILLOW\\nThe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for\\nHarry’s liking. He was looking forward to getting back\\nto Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been\\nthe happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel\\njealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and\\nthe sort of welcome he could expect next time he\\nturned up on Privet Drive.\\nOn their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a\\nsumptuous dinner that included all of Harry’s favorite\\nthings, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding.\\nFred and George rounded off the evening with a\\ndisplay of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the kitchen\\nwith red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to\\nwall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a\\nlast mug of hot chocolate and bed.\\nIt took a long while to get started next morning. They\\nwere up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to\\nhave a great deal to do. Mrs. Weasley dashed about in\\na bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people\\nkept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of\\n \\ntoast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke\\nhis neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed\\nthe yard carrying Ginny’s trunk to the car.\\nHarry couldn’t see how eight people, six large trunks,\\ntwo owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small\\nFord Anglia. He had reckoned, of course, without the\\nspecial features that Mr. Weasley had added.\\n“Not a word to Molly,” he whispered to Harry as he\\nopened the trunk and showed him how it had been\\nmagically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily.\\nWhen at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley\\nglanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred,\\nGeorge, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by\\nside, and said, “Muggles do know more than we give\\nthem credit for, don’t they?” She and Ginny got into\\nthe front seat, which had been stretched so that it\\nresembled a park bench. “I mean, you’d never know it\\nwas this roomy from the outside, would you?”\\nMr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled\\nout of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at\\nthe house. He barely had time to wonder when he’d\\nsee it again when they were back — George had\\nforgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes\\nafter that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that\\nFred could run in for his broomstick. They had\\nalmost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked\\nthat she’d left her diary. By the time she had\\nclambered back into the car, they were running very\\nlate, and tempers were running high.\\nMr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his\\nwife.\\n“Molly, dear — ”\\n \\n“No, Arthur — ”\\n“No one would see — this little button here is an\\nInvisibility Booster I installed — that’d get us up in\\nthe air — then we fly above the clouds. We’d be there\\nin ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser — ”\\n“I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight — ”\\nThey reached King’s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr.\\nWeasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for\\ntheir trunks and they all hurried into the station.\\nHarry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous\\nyear. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine\\nand three-quarters, which wasn’t visible to the\\nMuggle eye. What you had to do was walk through\\nthe solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It\\ndidn’t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that\\nnone of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.\\n“Percy first,” said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at\\nthe clock overhead, which showed they had only five\\nminutes to disappear casually through the barrier.\\nPercy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr.\\nWeasley went next; Fred and George followed.\\n“I’ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,” Mrs.\\nWeasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny’s hand\\nand setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone.\\n“Let’s go together, we’ve only got a minute,” Ron said\\nto Harry.\\nHarry made sure that Hedwig’s cage was safely\\nwedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley\\naround to face the barrier. He felt perfectly confident;\\nthis wasn’t nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo\\n \\npowder. Both of them bent low over the handles of\\ntheir trolleys and walked purposefully toward the\\nbarrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from it, they\\nbroke into a run and —\\nCRASH.\\nBoth trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward;\\nRon’s trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was\\nknocked off his feet, and Hedwig’s cage bounced onto\\nthe shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking\\nindignantly; people all around them stared and a\\nguard nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think\\nyou’re doing?”\\n“Lost control of the trolley,” Harry gasped, clutching\\nhis ribs as he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who\\nwas causing such a scene that there was a lot of\\nmuttering about cruelty to animals from the\\nsurrounding crowd.\\n“Why can’t we get through?” Harry hissed to Ron.\\n“I dunno — ”\\nRon looked wildly around. A dozen curious people\\nwere still watching them.\\n“We’re going to miss the train,” Ron whispered. “I\\ndon’t understand why the gateway’s sealed itself — ”\\nHarry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening\\nfeeling in the pit of his stomach. Ten seconds ... nine\\nseconds ...\\nHe wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was\\nright against the barrier and pushed with all his\\nmight. The metal remained solid.\\n \\nThree seconds ... two seconds ... one second ...\\n“It’s gone,” said Ron, sounding stunned. “The train’s\\nleft. What if Mum and Dad can’t get back through to\\nus? Have you got any Muggle money?”\\nHarry gave a hollow laugh. “The Dursleys haven’t\\ngiven me pocket money for about six years.”\\nRon pressed his ear to the cold barrier.\\n“Can’t hear a thing,” he said tensely. “What’re we\\ngoing to do? I don’t know how long it’ll take Mum and\\nDad to get back to us.”\\nThey looked around. People were still watching them,\\nmainly because of Hedwig’s continuing screeches.\\n“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said\\nHarry. “We’re attracting too much atten — ”\\n“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”\\n“What about it?”\\n“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”\\n“But I thought — ”\\n“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school,\\nhaven’t we? And even underage wizards are allowed to\\nuse magic if it’s a real emergency, section nineteen or\\nsomething of the Restriction of Thingy — ”\\n“But your mum and dad ...” said Harry, pushing\\nagainst the barrier again in the vain hope that it\\nwould give way. “How will they get home?”\\n \\n“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They\\nknow how to Apparate! You know, just vanish and\\nreappear at home! They only bother with Floo powder\\nand the car because we’re all underage and we’re not\\nallowed to Apparate yet. ...”\\nHarry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to\\nexcitement.\\n“Can you fly it?”\\n“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to\\nface the exit. “C’mon, let’s go. If we hurry we’ll be able\\nto follow the Hogwarts Express — ”\\nAnd they marched off through the crowd of curious\\nMuggles, out of the station and back onto the side\\nroad where the old Ford Anglia was parked.\\nRon unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of\\ntaps from his wand. They heaved their luggage back\\nin, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the\\nfront.\\n“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the\\nignition with another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his\\nhead out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along\\nthe main road ahead, but their street was empty.\\n“Okay,” he said.\\nRon pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard.\\nThe car around them vanished — and so did they.\\nHarry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear\\nthe engine, feel his hands on his knees and his\\nglasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had\\nbecome a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the\\nground in a dingy street full of parked cars.\\n \\n“Let’s go,” said Ron’s voice from his right.\\nAnd the ground and the dirty buildings on either side\\nfell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in\\nseconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and\\nglittering, below them.\\nThen there was a popping noise and the car, Harry,\\nand Ron reappeared.\\n“Uh-oh,” said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster.\\n“It’s faulty — ”\\nBoth of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it\\nflickered back again.\\n“Hold on!” Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the\\naccelerator; they shot straight into the low, woolly\\nclouds and everything turned dull and foggy.\\n“Now what?” said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of\\ncloud pressing in on them from all sides.\\n“We need to see the train to know what direction to go\\nin,” said Ron.\\n“Dip back down again — quickly — ”\\nThey dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted\\naround in their seats, squinting at the ground.\\n“I can see it!” Harry yelled. “Right ahead — there!”\\nThe Hogwarts Express was streaking along below\\nthem like a scarlet snake.\\n“Due north,” said Ron, checking the compass on the\\ndashboard. “Okay, we’ll just have to check on it every\\nhalf hour or so — hold on — ”\\n \\nAnd they shot up through the clouds. A minute later,\\nthey burst out into a blaze of sunlight.\\nIt was a different world. The wheels of the car\\nskimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright,\\nendless blue under the blinding white sun.\\n“All we’ve got to worry about now are airplanes,” said\\nRon.\\nThey looked at each other and started to laugh; for a\\nlong time, they couldn’t stop.\\nIt was as though they had been plunged into a\\nfabulous dream. This, thought Harry, was surely the\\nonly way to travel — past swirls and turrets of snowy\\ncloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat\\npack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the\\nprospect of seeing Fred’s and George’s jealous faces\\nwhen they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the\\nsweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle.\\nThey made regular checks on the train as they flew\\nfarther and farther north, each dip beneath the\\nclouds showing them a different view. London was\\nsoon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields\\nthat gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great\\ncity alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages\\nwith tiny toy churches.\\nSeveral uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to\\nadmit that some of the fun was wearing off. The\\ntoffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had\\nnothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their\\nsweaters, but Harry’s T-shirt was sticking to the back\\nof his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the\\nend of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the\\nfantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking\\nlongingly of the train miles below, where you could\\n \\nbuy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a\\nplump witch. Why hadn’t they been able to get onto\\nplatform nine and three-quarters?\\n“Can’t be much further, can it?” croaked Ron, hours\\nlater still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of\\ncloud, staining it a deep pink. “Ready for another\\ncheck on the train?”\\nIt was still right below them, winding its way past a\\nsnowcapped mountain. It was much darker beneath\\nthe canopy of clouds.\\nRon put his foot on the accelerator and drove them\\nupward again, but as he did so, the engine began to\\nwhine.\\nHarry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.\\n“It’s probably just tired,” said Ron. “It’s never been\\nthis far before. ...”\\nAnd they both pretended not to notice the whining\\ngrowing louder and louder as the sky became steadily\\ndarker. Stars were blossoming in the blackness.\\nHarry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the\\nway the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as\\nthough in protest.\\n“Not far,” said Ron, more to the car than to Harry,\\n“not far now,” and he patted the dashboard\\nnervously.\\nWhen they flew back beneath the clouds a little while\\nlater, they had to squint through the darkness for a\\nlandmark they knew.\\n“There!” Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig\\njump. “Straight ahead!”\\n \\nSilhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over\\nthe lake, stood the many turrets and towers of\\nHogwarts castle.\\nBut the car had begun to shudder and was losing\\nspeed.\\n“Come on,” Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering\\nwheel a little shake, “nearly there, come on — ”\\nThe engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were\\nissuing from under the hood. Harry found himself\\ngripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew\\ntoward the lake.\\nThe car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his\\nwindow, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy surface\\nof the water, a mile below. Ron’s knuckles were white\\non the steering wheel. The car wobbled again.\\n“Come on,” Ron muttered.\\nThey were over the lake — the castle was right ahead\\n— Ron put his foot down.\\nThere was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine\\ndied completely.\\n“Uh-oh,” said Ron, into the silence.\\nThe nose of the car dropped. They were falling,\\ngathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle\\nwall.\\n“IVoooooo!” Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel\\naround; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as\\nthe car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark\\ngreenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out\\nover the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.\\n \\nRon let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled\\nhis wand out of his back pocket —\\n“STOP! STOP!” he yelled, whacking the dashboard\\nand the windshield, but they were still plummeting,\\nthe ground flying up toward them —\\n“WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!” Harry bellowed,\\nlunging for the steering wheel, but too late —\\nCRUNCH.\\nWith an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit\\nthe thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a\\nheavy jolt. Steam was billowing from under the\\ncrumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a\\ngolf-ball-sized lump was throbbing on Harry’s head\\nwhere he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron\\nlet out a low, despairing groan.\\n“Are you okay?” Harry said urgently.\\n“My wand,” said Ron, in a shaky voice. “Look at my\\nwand — ”\\nIt had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling\\nlimply, held on by a few splinters.\\nHarry opened his mouth to say he was sure they’d be\\nable to mend it up at the school, but he never even\\ngot started. At that very moment, something hit his\\nside of the car with the force of a charging bull,\\nsending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an\\nequally heavy blow hit the roof.\\n“What’s happen — ?”\\nRon gasped, staring through the windshield, and\\nHarry looked around just in time to see a branch as\\n \\nthick as a python smash into it. The tree they had hit\\nwas attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost\\ndouble, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every\\ninch of the car it could reach.\\n“Aaargh!” said Ron as another twisted limb punched a\\nlarge dent into his door; the windshield was now\\ntrembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like\\ntwigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was\\npounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be\\ncaving —\\n“Run for it!” Ron shouted, throwing his full weight\\nagainst his door, but next second he had been\\nknocked backward into Harry’s lap by a vicious\\nuppercut from another branch.\\n“We’re done for!” he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but\\nsuddenly the floor of the car was vibrating — the\\nengine had restarted.\\n“Reverse!” Harry yelled, and the car shot backward;\\nthe tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear\\nits roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing\\nout at them as they sped out of reach.\\n“That,” panted Ron, “was close. Well done, car — ”\\nThe car, however, had reached the end of its tether.\\nWith two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry\\nfelt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was\\nsprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told him\\nthat the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk;\\nHedwig’s cage flew through the air and burst open;\\nshe rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off\\ntoward the castle without a backward look. Then,\\ndented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off\\ninto the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.\\n \\n“Come back!” Ron yelled after it, brandishing his\\nbroken wand. “Dad’ll kill me!”\\nBut the car disappeared from view with one last snort\\nfrom its exhaust.\\n“Can you believe our luck?” said Ron miserably,\\nbending down to pick up Scabbers. “Of all the trees\\nwe could’ve hit, we had to get one that hits back.”\\nHe glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree,\\nwhich was still flailing its branches threateningly.\\n“Come on,” said Harry wearily, “we’d better get up to\\nthe school. ...”\\nIt wasn’t at all the triumphant arrival they had\\npictured. Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends\\nof their trunks and began dragging them up the\\ngrassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.\\n“I think the feast’s already started,” said Ron,\\ndropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and\\ncrossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window.\\n“Hey — Harry — come and look — it’s the Sorting!”\\nHarry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered\\nin at the Great Hall.\\nInnumerable candles were hovering in midair over\\nfour long, crowded tables, making the golden plates\\nand goblets sparkle. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling,\\nwhich always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with\\nstars.\\nThrough the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats,\\nHarry saw a long line of scared-looking first years\\nfiling into the Hall. Ginny was among them, easily\\nvisible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile,\\n \\nProfessor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her\\nhair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts\\nSorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers.\\nEvery year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and\\ndirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts\\nhouses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\\nSlytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on,\\nexactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its\\ndecision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a few\\nhorrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going\\nto put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned\\nout more Dark witches and wizards than any other —\\nbut he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron,\\nHermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term,\\nHarry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House\\nChampionship, beating Slytherin for the first time in\\nseven years.\\nA very small, mousy-haired boy had been called\\nforward to place the hat on his head. Harry’s eyes\\nwandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore,\\nthe headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the\\nstaff table, his long silver beard and half-moon\\nglasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several\\nseats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in\\nrobes of aquamarine. And there at the end was\\nHagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his\\ngoblet.\\n“Hang on ...” Harry muttered to Ron. “There’s an\\nempty chair at the staff table. ... Where’s Snape?”\\nProfessor Severus Snape was Harry’s least favorite\\nteacher. Harry also happened to be Snape ’s least\\nfavorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by\\neverybody except the students from his own House\\n(Slytherin), Snape taught Potions.\\n \\n“Maybe he’s ill!” said Ron hopefully.\\n“Maybe he’s left,” said Harry, “because he missed out\\non the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again).”\\n“Or he might have been sacked).” said Ron\\nenthusiastically. “I mean, everyone hates him — ”\\n“Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them,\\n“he’s waiting to hear why you two didn’t arrive on the\\nschool train.”\\nHarry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in\\na cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin\\nman with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy,\\nshoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he\\nwas smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were\\nin very deep trouble.\\n“Follow me,” said Snape.\\nNot daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron\\nfollowed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing\\nentrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. A\\ndelicious smell of food was wafting from the Great\\nHall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and\\nlight, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the\\ndungeons.\\n“In!” he said, opening a door halfway down the cold\\npassageway and pointing.\\nThey entered Snape’s office, shivering. The shadowy\\nwalls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in\\nwhich floated all manner of revolting things Harry\\ndidn’t really want to know the name of at the\\nmoment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape\\nclosed the door and turned to look at them.\\n \\n“So,” he said softly, “the train isn’t good enough for\\nthe famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick,\\nWeasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?”\\n“No, sir, it was the barrier at King’s Cross, it — ”\\n“Silence!” said Snape coldly. “What have you done\\nwith the car?”\\nRon gulped. This wasn’t the first time Snape had\\ngiven Harry the impression of being able to read\\nminds. But a moment later, he understood, as Snape\\nunrolled today’s issue of the Evening Prophet\\n“You were seen,” he hissed, showing them the\\nheadline: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES\\nMUGGLES. He began to read aloud: “Two Muggles in\\nLondon, convinced they saw an old car flying over the\\nPost Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty\\nBayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus\\nFleet, of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven\\nMuggles in all. I believe your father works in the\\nMisuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?” he said, looking\\nup at Ron and smiling still more nastily. “Dear, dear\\n... his own son ...”\\nHarry felt as though he’d just been walloped in the\\nstomach by one of the mad tree’s larger branches. If\\nanyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car\\n...he hadn’t thought of that. ...\\n“I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable\\ndamage seems to have been done to a very valuable\\nWhomping Willow,” Snape went on.\\n“That tree did more damage to us than we — ” Ron\\nblurted out.\\n \\n“Silence!” snapped Snape again. “Most unfortunately,\\nyou are not in my House and the decision to expel\\nyou does not rest with me. I shall go and fetch the\\npeople who do have that happy power. You will wait\\nhere.”\\nHarry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced.\\nHarry didn’t feel hungry anymore. He now felt\\nextremely sick. He tried not to look at a large, slimy\\nsomething suspended in green liquid on a shelf\\nbehind Snape ’s desk. If Snape had gone to fetch\\nProfessor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they\\nwere hardly any better off. She might be fairer than\\nSnape, but she was still extremely strict.\\nTen minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough\\nit was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him.\\nHarry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on\\nseveral occasions, but either he had forgotten just\\nhow thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen\\nher this angry before. She raised her wand the\\nmoment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched,\\nbut she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace,\\nwhere flames suddenly erupted.\\n“Sit,” she said, and they both backed into chairs by\\nthe fire.\\n“Explain,” she said, her glasses glinting ominously.\\nRon launched into the story, starting with the barrier\\nat the station refusing to let them through.\\n“ — so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn’t get on\\nthe train.”\\n“Why didn’t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you\\nhave an owl?” Professor McGonagall said coldly to\\nHarry.\\n \\nHarry gaped at her. Now she’d said it, that seemed\\nthe obvious thing to have done.\\n“I — I didn’t think — ”\\n“That,” said Professor McGonagall, “is obvious.”\\nThere was a knock on the office door and Snape, now\\nlooking happier than ever, opened it. There stood the\\nheadmaster, Professor Dumbledore.\\nHarry’s whole body went numb. Dumbledore was\\nlooking unusually grave. He stared down his very\\ncrooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly found\\nhimself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up\\nby the Whomping Willow.\\nThere was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said,\\n“Please explain why you did this.”\\nIt would have been better if he had shouted. Harry\\nhated the disappointment in his voice. For some\\nreason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the\\neyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told\\nDumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley\\nowned the bewitched car, making it sound as though\\nhe and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked\\noutside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see\\nthrough this at once, but Dumbledore asked no\\nquestions about the car. When Harry had finished, he\\nmerely continued to peer at them through his\\nspectacles.\\n“Well go and get our stuff,” said Ron in a hopeless\\nsort of voice.\\n“What are you talking about, Weasley?” barked\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\n \\n“Well, you’re expelling us, aren’t you?” said Ron.\\nHarry looked quickly at Dumbledore.\\n“Not today, Mr. Weasley,” said Dumbledore. “But I\\nmust impress upon both of you the seriousness of\\nwhat you have done. I will be writing to both your\\nfamilies tonight. I must also warn you that if you do\\nanything like this again, I will have no choice but to\\nexpel you.”\\nSnape looked as though Christmas had been\\ncanceled. He cleared his throat and said, “Professor\\nDumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for\\nthe Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious\\ndamage to an old and valuable tree — surely acts of\\nthis nature — ”\\n“It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these\\nboys’ punishments, Severus,” said Dumbledore\\ncalmly. “They are in her House and are therefore her\\nresponsibility.” He turned to Professor McGonagall. “I\\nmust go back to the feast, Minerva, I’ve got to give out\\na few notices. Come, Severus, there’s a delicious-\\nlooking custard tart I want to sample — ”\\nSnape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as\\nhe allowed himself to be swept out of his office,\\nleaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who\\nwas still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.\\n“You’d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley,\\nyou’re bleeding.”\\n“Not much,” said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his\\neye with his sleeve. “Professor, I wanted to watch my\\nsister being Sorted — ”\\n \\n“The Sorting Ceremony is over,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall. “Your sister is also in Gryffindor.”\\n“Oh, good,” said Ron.\\n“And speaking of Gryffindor — ” Professor McGonagall\\nsaid sharply, but Harry cut in: “Professor, when we\\ntook the car, term hadn’t started, so — so Gryffindor\\nshouldn’t really have points taken from it — should\\nit?” he finished, watching her anxiously.\\nProfessor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but\\nhe was sure she had almost smiled. Her mouth\\nlooked less thin, anyway.\\n“I will not take any points from Gryffindor,” she said,\\nand Harry’s heart lightened considerably. “But you\\nwill both get a detention.”\\nIt was better than Harry had expected. As for\\nDumbledore’s writing to the Dursleys, that was\\nnothing. Harry knew perfectly well they’d just be\\ndisappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn’t\\nsquashed him flat.\\nProfessor McGonagall raised her wand again and\\npointed it at Snape’s desk. A large plate of\\nsandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced\\npumpkin juice appeared with a pop.\\n“You will eat in here and then go straight up to your\\ndormitory,” she said. “I must also return to the feast.”\\nWhen the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a\\nlong, low whistle.\\n“I thought we’d had it,” he said, grabbing a sandwich.\\n“So did I,” said Harry, taking one, too.\\n \\n“Can you believe our luck, though?” said Ron thickly\\nthrough a mouthful of chicken and ham. “Fred and\\nGeorge must’ve flown that car five or six times and no\\nMuggle ever saw them.” He swallowed and took\\nanother huge bite. “Why couldn’t we get through the\\nbarrier?”\\nHarry shrugged. “We’ll have to watch our step from\\nnow on, though,” he said, taking a grateful swig of\\npumpkin juice. “Wish we could’ve gone up to the\\nfeast. ...”\\n“She didn’t want us showing off,” said Ron sagely.\\n“Doesn’t want people to think it’s clever, arriving by\\nflying car.”\\nWhen they had eaten as many sandwiches as they\\ncould (the plate kept refilling itself), they rose and left\\nthe office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor\\nTower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast\\nwas over. They walked past muttering portraits and\\ncreaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of\\nstone stairs, until at last they reached the passage\\nwhere the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was\\nhidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in\\na pink silk dress.\\n“Password?” she said as they approached.\\n“Er — ” said Harry.\\nThey didn’t know the new year’s password, not having\\nmet a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost\\nimmediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them\\nand turned to see Hermione dashing toward them.\\n“There you are! Where have you been? The most\\nridiculous rumors — someone said you’d been\\nexpelled for crashing a flying car — ”\\n \\n“Well, we haven’t been expelled,” Harry assured her.\\n“You’re not telling me you did fly here?” said\\nHermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor\\nMcGonagall.\\n“Skip the lecture,” said Ron impatiently, “and tell us\\nthe new password.”\\n“It’s ‘wattlebird,’ ” said Hermione impatiently, “but\\nthat’s not the point — ”\\nHer words were cut short, however, as the portrait of\\nthe fat lady swung open and there was a sudden\\nstorm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of\\nGryffindor House was still awake, packed into the\\ncircular common room, standing on the lopsided\\ntables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to\\narrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull\\nHarry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble\\nin after them.\\n“Brilliant!” yelled Lee Jordan. “Inspired! What an\\nentrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping\\nWillow, people’ll be talking about that one for years —\\n“Good for you,” said a fifth year Harry had never\\nspoken to; someone was patting him on the back as\\nthough he’d just won a marathon; Fred and George\\npushed their way to the front of the crowd and said\\ntogether, “Why couldn’t we’ve come in the car, eh?”\\nRon was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly,\\nbut Harry could see one person who didn’t look happy\\nat all. Percy was visible over the heads of some\\nexcited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get\\nnear enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged\\nRon in the ribs and nodded in Percy’s direction. Ron\\ngot the point at once.\\n \\n“Got to get upstairs — bit tired,” he said, and the two\\nof them started pushing their way toward the door on\\nthe other side of the room, which led to a spiral\\nstaircase and the dormitories.\\n“ ’Night,” Harry called back to Hermione, who was\\nwearing a scowl just like Percy’s.\\nThey managed to get to the other side of the common\\nroom, still having their backs slapped, and gained the\\npeace of the staircase. They hurried up it, right to the\\ntop, and at last reached the door of their old\\ndormitory, which now had a sign on it saying\\nSECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular\\nroom, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet\\nand its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been\\nbrought up for them and stood at the ends of their\\nbeds.\\nRon grinned guiltily at Harry.\\n“I know I shouldn’t ’ve enjoyed that or anything, but —\\nThe dormitory door flew open and in came the other\\nsecond year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean\\nThomas, and Neville Longbottom.\\n“Unbelievablel” beamed Seamus.\\n“Cool,” said Dean.\\n“Amazing,” said Neville, awestruck.\\nHarry couldn’t help it. He grinned, too.\\n \\n6\\nGILDEROY LOCKHART\\nThe next day, however, Harry barely grinned once.\\nThings started to go downhill from breakfast in the\\nGreat Hall. The four long House tables were laden\\nwith tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains\\nof toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the\\nenchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry\\nand Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to\\nHermione, who had her copy of Voyages with\\nVampires propped open against a milk jug. There was\\na slight stiffness in the way she said “ ’Morning,”\\nwhich told Harry that she was still disapproving of the\\nway they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the\\nother hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a\\nround-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst\\nmemory of anyone Harry had ever met.\\n“Mail’s due any minute — I think Gran’s sending a\\nfew things I forgot.”\\nHarry had only just started his porridge when, sure\\nenough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a\\nhundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and\\n \\ndropping letters and packages into the chattering\\ncrowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville’s\\nhead and, a second later, something large and gray\\nfell into Hermione’s jug, spraying them all with milk\\nand feathers.\\n“Errol\\\\” said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by\\nthe feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table,\\nhis legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his\\nbeak.\\n“Oh, no — ” Ron gasped.\\n“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said Hermione, prodding\\nErrol gently with the tip of her finger.\\n“It’s not that — it’s that.”\\nRon was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite\\nordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both\\nlooking at it as though they expected it to explode.\\n“What’s the matter?” said Harry.\\n“She’s — she’s sent me a Howler,” said Ron faintly.\\n“You’d better open it, Ron,” said Neville in a timid\\nwhisper. “It’ll be worse if you don’t. My gran sent me\\none once, and I ignored it and” — he gulped — “it was\\nhorrible.”\\nHarry looked from their petrified faces to the red\\nenvelope.\\n“What’s a Howler?” he said.\\nBut Ron’s whole attention was fixed on the letter,\\nwhich had begun to smoke at the corners.\\n \\n“Open it,” Neville urged. “It’ll all be over in a few\\nminutes — ”\\nRon stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope\\nfrom Errol’s beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his\\nfingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew\\nwhy. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar\\nof sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the\\nceiling.\\n“— STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN\\nSURPRISED IF THEY’D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT\\nTILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON’T SUPPOSE YOU\\nSTOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I\\nWENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE — ”\\nMrs. Weasley’s yells, a hundred times louder than\\nusual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table,\\nand echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People\\nthroughout the hall were swiveling around to see who\\nhad received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his\\nchair that only his crimson forehead could be seen.\\n“— LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I\\nTHOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME,\\nWE DIDN’T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS,\\nYOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED — ”\\nHarry had been wondering when his name was going\\nto crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he\\ncouldn’t hear the voice that was making his eardrums\\nthrob.\\n“— ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED — YOUR FATHER’S\\nFACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR\\nFAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE\\nWE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.”\\n \\nA ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had\\ndropped from Ron’s hand, burst into flames and\\ncurled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as\\nthough a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few\\npeople laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke\\nout again.\\nHermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked\\ndown at the top of Ron’s head.\\n“Well, I don’t know what you expected, Ron, but you\\n“Don’t tell me I deserved it,” snapped Ron.\\nHarry pushed his porridge away. His insides were\\nburning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry\\nat work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for\\nhim over the summer . . .\\nBut he had no time to dwell on this; Professor\\nMcGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table,\\nhanding out course schedules. Harry took his and\\nsaw that they had double Herbology with the\\nHufflepuffs first.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together,\\ncrossed the vegetable patch, and made for the\\ngreenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At\\nleast the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione\\nseemed to think they had now been punished enough\\nand was being perfectly friendly again.\\nAs they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of\\nthe class standing outside, waiting for Professor\\nSprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just\\njoined them when she came striding into view across\\nthe lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart.\\nProfessor Sprout’s arms were full of bandages, and\\n \\nwith another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the\\nWhomping Willow in the distance, several of its\\nbranches now in slings.\\nProfessor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a\\npatched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually\\na large amount of earth on her clothes and her\\nfingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint.\\nGilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in\\nsweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining\\nunder a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold\\ntrimming.\\n“Oh, hello there!” he called, beaming around at the\\nassembled students. “Just been showing Professor\\nSprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow!\\nBut I don’t want you running away with the idea that\\nI’m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to\\nhave met several of these exotic plants on my travels\\n??\\n“Greenhouse three today, chaps!” said Professor\\nSprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at\\nall her usual cheerful self.\\nThere was a murmur of interest. They had only ever\\nworked in greenhouse one before — greenhouse three\\nhoused far more interesting and dangerous plants.\\nProfessor Sprout took a large key from her belt and\\nunlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp\\nearth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume\\nof some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from\\nthe ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione\\ninside when Lockhart’s hand shot out.\\n“Harry! I’ve been wanting a word — you don’t mind if\\nhe’s a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor\\nSprout?”\\n \\nJudging by Professor Sprout’s scowl, she did mind,\\nbut Lockhart said, “That’s the ticket,” and closed the\\ngreenhouse door in her face.\\n“Harry,” said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming\\nin the sunlight as he shook his head. “Harry, Harry,\\nHarry.”\\nCompletely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.\\n“When I heard — well, of course, it was all my fault.\\nCould have kicked myself.”\\nHarry had no idea what he was talking about. He was\\nabout to say so when Lockhart went on, “Don’t know\\nwhen I’ve been more shocked. Flying a car to\\nHogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you’d\\ndone it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.”\\nIt was remarkable how he could show every one of\\nthose brilliant teeth even when he wasn’t talking.\\n“Gave you a taste for publicity, didn’t I?” said\\nLockhart. “Gave you the bug. You got onto the front\\npage of the paper with me and you couldn’t wait to do\\nit again.”\\n“Oh, no, Professor, see — ”\\n“Harry, Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, reaching out\\nand grasping his shoulder. “I understand. Natural to\\nwant a bit more once you’ve had that first taste —\\nand I blame myself for giving you that, because it was\\nbound to go to your head — but see here, young man,\\nyou can’t start flying cars to try and get yourself\\nnoticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for\\nall that when you’re older. Yes, yes, I know what\\nyou’re thinking! ‘It’s all right for him, he’s an\\ninternationally famous wizard already! ’ But when I\\n \\nwas twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are\\nnow. In fact, I’d say I was even more of a nobody! I\\nmean, a few people have heard of you, haven’t they?\\nAll that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!”\\nHe glanced at the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead.\\n“I know, I know — it’s not quite as good as winning\\nWitch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award five\\ntimes in a row, as I have — but it’s a start, Harry, it’s\\na start”\\nHe gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry\\nstood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering\\nhe was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened\\nthe door and slid inside.\\nProfessor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench\\nin the center of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of\\ndifferent-colored ear-muffs were lying on the bench.\\nWhen Harry had taken his place between Ron and\\nHermione, she said, “We’ll be repotting Mandrakes\\ntoday. Now, who can tell me the properties of the\\nMandrake?”\\nTo nobody’s surprise, Hermione’s hand was first into\\nthe air.\\n“Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,”\\nsaid Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had\\nswallowed the textbook. “It is used to return people\\nwho have been transfigured or cursed to their original\\nstate.”\\n“Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,” said Professor\\nSprout. “The Mandrake forms an essential part of\\nmost antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who\\ncan tell me why?”\\nHermione’s hand narrowly missed Harry’s glasses as\\nit shot up again.\\n \\n“The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears\\nit,” she said promptly.\\n“Precisely. Take another ten points,” said Professor\\nSprout. “Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still\\nvery young.”\\nShe pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and\\neveryone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred\\nor so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were\\ngrowing there in rows. They looked quite\\nunremarkable to Harry, who didn’t have the slightest\\nidea what Hermione meant by the “cry” of the\\nMandrake.\\n“Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,” said Professor\\nSprout.\\nThere was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair\\nthat wasn’t pink and fluffy.\\n“When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears\\nare completely covered,” said Professor Sprout. “When\\nit is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-\\nup. Right — earmuffs on.”\\nHarry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut\\nout sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink,\\nfluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of\\nher robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and\\npulled hard.\\nHarry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could\\nhear.\\nInstead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly\\nbaby popped out of the earth. The leaves were\\ngrowing right out of his head. He had pale green,\\n \\nmottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his\\nlungs.\\nProfessor Sprout took a large plant pot from under\\nthe table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying\\nhim in dark, damp compost until only the tufted\\nleaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her\\nhands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed\\nher own earmuffs.\\n“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries\\nwon’t kill yet,” she said calmly as though she’d just\\ndone nothing more exciting than water a begonia.\\n“However, they will knock you out for several hours,\\nand as I’m sure none of you want to miss your first\\nday back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in\\nplace while you work. I will attract your attention\\nwhen it is time to pack up.\\n“Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here\\n— compost in the sacks over there — and be careful\\nof the Venomous Tentacula, it’s teething.”\\nShe gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as\\nshe spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had\\nbeen inching sneakily over her shoulder.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by\\na curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but\\nhad never spoken to.\\n“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he said brightly, shaking\\nHarry by the hand. “Know who you are, of course, the\\nfamous Harry Potter. ... And you’re Hermione Granger\\n— always top in everything” (Hermione beamed as she\\nhad her hand shaken too) “ — and Ron Weasley.\\nWasn’t that your flying car?”\\n \\nRon didn’t smile. The Howler was obviously still on\\nhis mind.\\n“That Lockhart’s something, isn’t he?” said Justin\\nhappily as they began filling their plant pots with\\ndragon dung compost. “Awfully brave chap. Have you\\nread his books? I’d have died of fear if I’d been\\ncornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he\\nstayed cool and — zap — just fantastic.\\n“My name was down for Eton, you know. I can’t tell\\nyou how glad I am I came here instead. Of course,\\nMother was slightly disappointed, but since I made\\nher read Lockhart’s books I think she’s begun to see\\nhow useful it’ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the\\nfamily. ...”\\nAfter that they didn’t have much chance to talk. Their\\nearmuffs were back on and they needed to\\nconcentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had\\nmade it look extremely easy, but it wasn’t. The\\nMandrakes didn’t like coming out of the earth, but\\ndidn’t seem to want to go back into it either. They\\nsquirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and\\ngnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes\\ntrying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.\\nBy the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was\\nsweaty, aching, and covered in earth. Everyone\\ntraipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then\\nthe Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.\\nProfessor McGonagall’s classes were always hard\\nwork, but today was especially difficult. Everything\\nHarry had learned last year seemed to have leaked\\nout of his head during the summer. He was supposed\\nto be turning a beetle into a button, but all he\\nmanaged to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as\\nit scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.\\n \\nRon was having far worse problems. He had patched\\nup his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it\\nseemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept\\ncrackling and sparking at odd moments, and every\\ntime Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed\\nhim in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs.\\nUnable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally\\nsquashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for\\na new one. Professor McGonagall wasn’t pleased.\\nHarry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain\\nfelt like a wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the\\nclassroom except him and Ron, who was whacking\\nhis wand furiously on the desk.\\n“Stupid — useless — thing — ”\\n“Write home for another one,” Harry suggested as the\\nwand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker.\\n“Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,” said Ron,\\nstuffing the now hissing wand into his bag. “ ‘It’s your\\nown fault your wand got snapped — ’ ”\\nThey went down to lunch, where Ron’s mood was not\\nimproved by Hermione’s showing them the handful of\\nperfect coat buttons she had produced in\\nT ransfiguration .\\n“What’ve we got this afternoon?” said Harry, hastily\\nchanging the subject.\\n“Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said Hermione at\\nonce.\\n“Why,” demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, “have\\nyou outlined all Lockhart’s lessons in little hearts?”\\n \\nHermione snatched the schedule back, blushing\\nfuriously.\\nThey finished lunch and went outside into the\\novercast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone\\nstep and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires\\nagain. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch\\nfor several minutes before Harry became aware that\\nhe was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the\\nvery small, mousy-haired boy he’d seen trying on the\\nSorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though\\ntransfixed. He was clutching what looked like an\\nordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry\\nlooked at him, he went bright red.\\n“All right, Harry? I’m — I’m Colin Creevey,” he said\\nbreathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. “I’m in\\nGryffindor, too. D’you think — would it be all right if\\n— can I have a picture?” he said, raising the camera\\nhopefully.\\n“A picture?” Harry repeated blankly.\\n“So I can prove I’ve met you,” said Colin Creevey\\neagerly, edging further forward. “I know all about you.\\nEveryone’s told me. About how you survived when\\nYou-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he\\ndisappeared and everything and how you’ve still got a\\nlightning scar on your forehead” (his eyes raked\\nHarry’s hairline) “and a boy in my dormitory said if I\\ndevelop the film in the right potion, the pictures’ll\\nmove.” Colin drew a great shuddering breath of\\nexcitement and said, “It’s amazing here, isn’t it? I\\nnever knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I\\ngot the letter from Hogwarts. My dad’s a milkman, he\\ncouldn’t believe it either. So I’m taking loads of\\npictures to send home to him. And it’d be really good\\nif I had one of you” — he looked imploringly at Harry\\n \\n— “maybe your friend could take it and I could stand\\nnext to you? And then, could you sign it?”\\n“ Signed photos? You’re giving out signed photos,\\nPotter?”\\nLoud and scathing, Draco Malfoy’s voice echoed\\naround the courtyard. He had stopped right behind\\nColin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his\\nlarge and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.\\n“Everyone line up!” Malfoy roared to the crowd. “Harry\\nPotter’s giving out signed photos!”\\n“No, I’m not,” said Harry angrily, his fists clenching.\\n“Shut up, Malfoy.”\\n“You’re just jealous,” piped up Colin, whose entire\\nbody was about as thick as Crabbe ’s neck.\\n“Jealous?” said Malfoy, who didn’t need to shout\\nanymore: Half the courtyard was listening in. “Of\\nwhat? I don’t want a foul scar right across my head,\\nthanks. I don’t think getting your head cut open\\nmakes you that special, myself.”\\nCrabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.\\n“Eat slugs, Malfoy,” said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped\\nlaughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a\\nmenacing way.\\n“Be careful, Weasley,” sneered Malfoy. “You don’t\\nwant to start any trouble or your mommy’ll have to\\ncome and take you away from school.” He put on a\\nshrill, piercing voice. “If you put another toe out of line\\n \\nA knot of Slytherin fifth years nearby laughed loudly\\nat this.\\n“Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,” smirked\\nMalfoy. “It’d be worth more than his family’s whole\\nhouse — ”\\nRon whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione\\nshut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and\\nwhispered, “Look out!”\\n“What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart\\nwas striding toward them, his turquoise robes\\nswirling behind him. “Who’s giving out signed\\nphotos?”\\nHarry started to speak but he was cut short as\\nLockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and\\nthundered jovially, “Shouldn’t have asked! We meet\\nagain, Harry!”\\nPinned to Lockhart’s side and burning with\\nhumiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back\\ninto the crowd.\\n“Come on then, Mr. Creevey,” said Lockhart, beaming\\nat Colin. “A double portrait, can’t do better than that,\\nand well both sign it for you.”\\nColin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as\\nthe bell rang behind them, signaling the start of\\nafternoon classes.\\n“Off you go, move along there,” Lockhart called to the\\ncrowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry,\\nwho was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell,\\nstill clasped to his side.\\n \\n“A word to the wise, Harry,” said Lockhart paternally\\nas they entered the building through a side door. “I\\ncovered up for you back there with young Creevey —\\nif he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates\\nwon’t think you’re setting yourself up so much. ...”\\nDeaf to Harry’s stammers, Lockhart swept him down\\na corridor lined with staring students and up a\\nstaircase.\\n“Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at\\nthis stage of your career isn’t sensible — looks a tad\\nbigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a\\ntime when, like me, you’ll need to keep a stack handy\\nwherever you go, but” — he gave a little chortle — “I\\ndon’t think you’re quite there yet.”\\nThey had reached Lockhart’s classroom and he let\\nHarry go at last. Harry yanked his robes straight and\\nheaded for a seat at the very back of the class, where\\nhe busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart’s\\nbooks in front of him, so that he could avoid looking\\nat the real thing.\\nThe rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and\\nHermione sat down on either side of Harry.\\n“You could’ve fried an egg on your face,” said Ron.\\n“You’d better hope Creevey doesn’t meet Ginny, or\\nthey’ll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.”\\n“Shut up,” snapped Harry. The last thing he needed\\nwas for Lockhart to hear the phrase “Harry Potter fan\\nclub.”\\nWhen the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared\\nhis throat loudly and silence fell. He reached forward,\\npicked up Neville Longbottom’s copy of Travels with\\n \\nTrolls, and held it up to show his own, winking\\nportrait on the front.\\n“Me,” he said, pointing at it and winking as well.\\n“Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class,\\nHonorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League,\\nand five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-\\nCharming- Smile Award — but I don’t talk about that.\\nI didn’t get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at\\nher!”\\nHe waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled\\nweakly.\\n“I see you’ve all bought a complete set of my books —\\nwell done. I thought we’d start today with a little quiz.\\nNothing to worry about — just to check how well\\nyou’ve read them, how much you’ve taken in — ”\\nWhen he had handed out the test papers he returned\\nto the front of the class and said, “You have thirty\\nminutes — start — now\\\\”\\nHarry looked down at his paper and read:\\n1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s favorite color?\\n2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s secret ambition?\\n3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart’s\\ngreatest achievement to date?\\nOn and on it went, over three sides of paper, right\\ndown to:\\n54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart’s birthday, and what\\nwould his ideal gift be?\\n \\nHalf an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and\\nrifled through them in front of the class.\\n“Tut, tut — hardly any of you remembered that my\\nfavorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti.\\nAnd a few of you need to read Wanderings with\\nWerewolves more carefully — I clearly state in\\nchapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be\\nharmony between all magic and non-magic peoples —\\nthough I wouldn’t say no to a large bottle of Ogden’s\\nOld Firewhisky!”\\nHe gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now\\nstaring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on\\nhis face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who\\nwere sitting in front, were shaking with silent\\nlaughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening\\nto Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when\\nhe mentioned her name.\\n\"... but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret\\nambition is to rid the world of evil and market my\\nown range of hair-care potions — good girl! In fact” —\\nhe flipped her paper over — “full marks! Where is\\nMiss Hermione Granger?”\\nHermione raised a trembling hand.\\n“Excellent!” beamed Lockhart. “Quite excellent! Take\\nten points for Gryffindor! And so — to business — ”\\nHe bent down behind his desk and lifted a large,\\ncovered cage onto it.\\n“Now — be warned! It is my job to arm you against\\nthe foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may\\nfind yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.\\nKnow only that no harm can befall you whilst I am\\nhere. All I ask is that you remain calm.”\\n \\nIn spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of\\nbooks for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a\\nhand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped\\nlaughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row\\nseat.\\n“I must ask you not to scream,” said Lockhart in a\\nlow voice. “It might provoke them.”\\nAs the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped\\noff the cover.\\n“Yes,” he said dramatically. “ Freshly caught Cornish\\npixies.”\\nSeamus Finnigan couldn’t control himself. He let out\\na snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn’t\\nmistake for a scream of terror.\\n“Yes?” He smiled at Seamus.\\n“Well, they’re not — they’re not very — dangerous, are\\nthey?” Seamus choked.\\n“Don’t be so sure!” said Lockhart, waggling a finger\\nannoyingly at Seamus. “Devilish tricky little blighters\\nthey can be!”\\nThe pixies were electric blue and about eight inches\\nhigh, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was\\nlike listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment\\nthe cover had been removed, they had started\\njabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and\\nmaking bizarre faces at the people nearest them.\\n“Right, then,” Lockhart said loudly. “Let’s see what\\nyou make of them!” And he opened the cage.\\n \\nIt was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every\\ndirection like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by\\nthe ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot\\nstraight through the window, showering the back row\\nwith broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the\\nclassroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino.\\nThey grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with\\nthem, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from\\nthe walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags\\nand books and threw them out of the smashed\\nwindow; within minutes, half the class was sheltering\\nunder desks and Neville was swinging from the iron\\nchandelier in the ceiling.\\n“Come on now — round them up, round them up,\\nthey’re only pixies,” Lockhart shouted.\\nHe rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and\\nbellowed, “Peskipiksi Pesternomti”\\nIt had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his\\nwand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart\\ngulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly\\navoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second\\nlater as the chandelier gave way.\\nThe bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the\\nexit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart\\nstraightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione, who were almost at the door, and said,\\n“Well, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them\\nback into their cage.” He swept past them and shut\\nthe door quickly behind him.\\n“Can you believe him?” roared Ron as one of the\\nremaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear.\\n“He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,”\\nsaid Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a\\n \\nclever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into\\ntheir cage.\\n“Hands on?” said Harry, who was trying to grab a\\npixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out.\\n“Hermione, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing\\n“Rubbish,” said Hermione. “You’ve read his books —\\nlook at all those amazing things he’s done — ”\\n“He says he’s done,” Ron muttered.\\n \\n7\\nMUDBLOODS AND MURMURS\\nHarry spent a lot of time over the next few days\\ndodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy\\nLockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid\\nwas Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized\\nHarry’s schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a\\nbigger thrill than to say, “All right, Harry?” six or\\nseven times a day and hear, “Hello, Colin,” back,\\nhowever exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.\\nHedwig was still angry with Harry about the\\ndisasterous car journey and Ron’s wand was still\\nmalfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning\\nby shooting out of Ron’s hand in Charms and hitting\\ntiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes,\\ncreating a large, throbbing green boil where it had\\nstruck. So with one thing and another, Harry was\\nquite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and\\nHermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday\\nmorning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several\\nhours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver\\nWood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.\\n \\n“Whassamatter?” said Harry groggily.\\n“Quidditch practice!” said Wood. “Come on!”\\nHarry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist\\nhanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he\\nwas awake, he couldn’t understand how he could\\nhave slept through the racket the birds were making.\\n“Oliver,” Harry croaked. “It’s the crack of dawn.”\\n“Exactly,” said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth\\nyear and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with\\na crazed enthusiasm. “It’s part of our new training\\nprogram. Come on, grab your broom, and let’s go,”\\nsaid Wood heartily. “None of the other teams have\\nstarted training yet; we’re going to be first off the\\nmark this year — ”\\nYawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of\\nbed and tried to find his Quidditch robes.\\n“Good man,” said Wood. “Meet you on the field in\\nfifteen minutes.”\\nWhen he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on\\nhis cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron\\nexplaining where he’d gone and went down the spiral\\nstaircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two\\nThousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the\\nportrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and\\nColin Creevey came dashing down the spiral\\nstaircase, his camera swinging madly around his\\nneck and something clutched in his hand.\\n“I heard someone saying your name on the stairs,\\nHarry! Look what I’ve got here! I’ve had it developed, I\\nwanted to show you — ”\\n \\nHarry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was\\nbrandishing under his nose.\\nA moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard\\non an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was\\npleased to see that his photographic self was putting\\nup a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view.\\nAs Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped,\\npanting, against the white edge of the picture.\\n“Will you sign it?” said Colin eagerly.\\n“No,” said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that\\nthe room was really deserted. “Sorry, Colin, I’m in a\\nhurry — Quidditch practice — ”\\nHe climbed through the portrait hole.\\n“Oh, wow! Wait for me! I’ve never watched a Quidditch\\ngame before!”\\nColin scrambled through the hole after him.\\n“It’ll be really boring,” Harry said quickly, but Colin\\nignored him, his face shining with excitement.\\n“You were the youngest House player in a hundred\\nyears, weren’t you, Harry? Weren’t you?” said Colin,\\ntrotting alongside him. “You must be brilliant. I’ve\\nnever flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is\\nthat the best one there is?”\\nHarry didn’t know how to get rid of him. It was like\\nhaving an extremely talkative shadow.\\n“I don’t really understand Quidditch,” said Colin\\nbreathlessly. “Is it true there are four balls? And two\\nof them fly around trying to knock people off their\\nbrooms?”\\n \\n“Yes,” said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the\\ncomplicated rules of Quidditch. “They’re called\\nBludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who\\ncarry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side.\\nFred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.”\\n“And what are the other balls for?” Colin asked,\\ntripping down a couple of steps because he was\\ngazing open-mouthed at Harry.\\n“Well, the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is\\nthe one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each\\nteam throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get\\nit through the goal posts at the end of the pitch —\\nthey’re three long poles with hoops on the end.”\\n“And the fourth ball — ”\\n“ — is the Golden Snitch,” said Harry, “and it’s very\\nsmall, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that’s what\\nthe Seeker’s got to do, because a game of Quidditch\\ndoesn’t end until the Snitch has been caught. And\\nwhichever team’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his\\nteam an extra hundred and fifty points.”\\n“And you’re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren’t you?” said\\nColin in awe.\\n“Yes,” said Harry as they left the castle and started\\nacross the dew-drenched grass. “And there’s the\\nKeeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That’s it,\\nreally.”\\nBut Colin didn’t stop questioning Harry all the way\\ndown the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and\\nHarry only shook him off when he reached the\\nchanging rooms; Colin called after him in a piping\\nvoice, “I’ll go and get a good seat, Harry!” and hurried\\noff to the stands.\\n \\nThe rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the\\nchanging room. Wood was the only person who looked\\ntruly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting,\\npuffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year\\nAlicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against\\nthe wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell\\nand Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side\\nopposite them.\\n“There you are, Harry, what kept you?” said Wood\\nbriskly. “Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all\\nbefore we actually get onto the field, because I spent\\nthe summer devising a whole new training program,\\nwhich I really think will make all the difference. ...”\\nWood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch\\nfield, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and\\ncrosses in different-colored inks. He took out his\\nwand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to\\nwiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood\\nlaunched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred\\nWeasley’s head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet’s\\nshoulder and he began to snore.\\nThe first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain,\\nbut there was another board under that, and a third\\nunder that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood\\ndroned on and on.\\n“So,” said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a\\nwistful fantasy about what he could be eating for\\nbreakfast at this very moment up at the castle. “Is\\nthat clear? Any questions?”\\n“I’ve got a question, Oliver,” said George, who had\\nwoken with a start. “Why couldn’t you have told us all\\nthis yesterday when we were awake?”\\nWood wasn’t pleased.\\n \\n“Now, listen here, you lot,” he said, glowering at them\\nall. “We should have won the Quidditch Cup last year.\\nWe’re easily the best team. But unfortunately —\\nowing to circumstances beyond our control — ”\\nHarry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been\\nunconscious in the hospital wing for the final match\\nof the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had\\nbeen a player short and had suffered their worst\\ndefeat in three hundred years.\\nWood took a moment to regain control of himself.\\nTheir last defeat was clearly still torturing him.\\n“So this year, we train harder than ever before. ...\\nOkay, let’s go and put our new theories into practice!”\\nWood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the\\nway out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still\\nyawning, his team followed.\\nThey had been in the locker room so long that the\\nsun was up completely now, although remnants of\\nmist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry\\nwalked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione\\nsitting in the stands.\\n“Aren’t you finished yet?” called Ron incredulously.\\n“Haven’t even started,” said Harry, looking jealously\\nat the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had\\nbrought out of the Great Hall. “Wood’s been teaching\\nus new moves.”\\nHe mounted his broomstick and kicked at the\\nground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air\\nwhipped his face, waking him far more effectively\\nthan Wood’s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on\\nthe Quidditch field. He soared right around the\\nstadium at full speed, racing Fred and George.\\n \\n“What’s that funny clicking noise?” called Fred as\\nthey hurtled around the corner.\\nHarry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one\\nof the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture\\nafter picture, the sound strangely magnified in the\\ndeserted stadium.\\n“Look this way, Harry! This way!” he cried shrilly.\\n“Who’s that?” said Fred.\\n“No idea,” Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that\\ntook him as far away as possible from Colin.\\n“What’s going on?” said Wood, frowning, as he\\nskimmed through the air toward them. “Why’s that\\nfirst year taking pictures? I don’t like it. He could be a\\nSlytherin spy, trying to find out about our new\\ntraining program.”\\n“He’s in Gryffindor,” said Harry quickly.\\n“And the Slytherins don’t need a spy, Oliver,” said\\nGeorge.\\n“What makes you say that?” said Wood testily.\\n“Because they’re here in person,” said George,\\npointing.\\nSeveral people in green robes were walking onto the\\nfield, broomsticks in their hands.\\n“I don’t believe it!” Wood hissed in outrage. “I booked\\nthe field for today! We’ll see about this!”\\n \\nWood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder\\nthan he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as\\nhe dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed.\\n“Flint!” Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. “This\\nis our practice time! We got up specially! You can\\nclear off now!”\\nMarcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a\\nlook of trollish cunning on his face as he replied,\\n“Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.”\\nAngelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There\\nwere no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood\\nshoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering\\nto a man.\\n“But I booked the field!” said Wood, positively spitting\\nwith rage. “I booked it!”\\n“Ah,” said Flint. “But Tve got a specially signed note\\nhere from Professor Snape. % Professor S. Snape, give\\nthe Slytherin team permission to practice today on the\\nQuidditch field owinq to the need to train their new\\nSeeker. ’ ”\\n“You’ve got a new Seeker?” said Wood, distracted.\\n“Where?”\\nAnd from behind the six large figures before them\\ncame a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his\\npale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.\\n“Aren’t you Lucius Malfoy’s son?” said Fred, looking\\nat Malfoy with dislike.\\n“Funny you should mention Draco’s father,” said Flint\\nas the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly.\\n \\n“Let me show you the generous gift he’s made to the\\nSlytherin team.”\\nAll seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven\\nhighly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of\\nfine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two\\nThousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors’\\nnoses in the early morning sun.\\n“Very latest model. Only came out last month,” said\\nFlint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end\\nof his own. “I believe it outstrips the old Two\\nThousand series by a considerable amount. As for the\\nold Cleansweeps” — he smiled nastily at Fred and\\nGeorge, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives —\\n“sweeps the board with them.”\\nNone of the Gryffindor team could think of anything\\nto say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly\\nhis cold eyes were reduced to slits.\\n“Oh, look,” said Flint. “A field invasion.”\\nRon and Hermione were crossing the grass to see\\nwhat was going on.\\n“What’s happening?” Ron asked Harry. “Why aren’t\\nyou playing? And what’s he doing here?”\\nHe was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin\\nQuidditch robes.\\n“I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,” said Malfoy,\\nsmugly. “Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms\\nmy father’s bought our team.”\\nRon gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb\\nbroomsticks in front of him.\\n \\n“Good, aren’t they?” said Malfoy smoothly. “But\\nperhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some\\ngold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off\\nthose Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would\\nbid for them.”\\nThe Slytherin team howled with laughter.\\n“At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy\\ntheir way in,” said Hermione sharply. “They got in on\\npure talent.”\\nThe smug look on Malfoy’s face flickered.\\n“No one asked your opinion, you filthy little\\nMudblood,” he spat.\\nHarry knew at once that Malfoy had said something\\nreally bad because there was an instant uproar at his\\nwords. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred\\nand George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How\\ndare you\\\\”, and Ron plunged his hand into his robes,\\npulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one,\\nMalfoy!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm at\\nMalfoy’s face.\\nA loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of\\ngreen light shot out of the wrong end of Ron’s wand,\\nhitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling\\nbackward onto the grass.\\n“Ron! Ron! Are you all right?” squealed Hermione.\\nRon opened his mouth to speak, but no words came\\nout. Instead he gave an almighty belch and several\\nslugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.\\nThe Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter.\\nFlint was doubled up, hanging onto his new\\n \\nbroomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours,\\nbanging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were\\ngathered around Ron, who kept belching large,\\nglistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch\\nhim.\\n“We’d better get him to Hagrid’s, it’s nearest,” said\\nHarry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair\\nof them pulled Ron up by the arms.\\n“What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill?\\nBut you can cure him, can’t you?” Colin had run\\ndown from his seat and was now dancing alongside\\nthem as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and\\nmore slugs dribbled down his front.\\n“Oooh,” said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera.\\n“Can you hold him still, Harry?”\\n“Get out of the way, Colin!” said Harry angrily. He and\\nHermione supported Ron out of the stadium and\\nacross the grounds toward the edge of the forest.\\n“Nearly there, Ron,” said Hermione as the\\ngamekeeper’s cabin came into view. “You’ll be all right\\nin a minute — almost there — ”\\nThey were within twenty feet of Hagrid’s house when\\nthe front door opened, but it wasn’t Hagrid who\\nemerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest\\nmauve today, came striding out.\\n“Quick, behind here,” Harry hissed, dragging Ron\\nbehind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat\\nreluctantly.\\n“It’s a simple matter if you know what you’re doing!”\\nLockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. “If you need\\nhelp, you know where I am! I’ll let you have a copy of\\n \\nmy book. I’m surprised you haven’t already got one —\\nI’ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!”\\nAnd he strode away toward the castle.\\nHarry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then\\npulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid’s front\\ndoor. They knocked urgently.\\nHagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but\\nhis expression brightened when he saw who it was.\\n“Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me — come\\nin, come in — thought you mighta bin Professor\\nLockhart back again — ”\\nHarry and Hermione supported Ron over the\\nthreshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an\\nenormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily\\nin the other. Hagrid didn’t seem perturbed by Ron’s\\nslug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he\\nlowered Ron into a chair.\\n“Better out than in,” he said cheerfully, plunking a\\nlarge copper basin in front of him. “Get ’em all up,\\nRon.”\\n“I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it\\nto stop,” said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend\\nover the basin. “That’s a difficult curse to work at the\\nbest of times, but with a broken wand — ”\\nHagrid was bustling around making them tea. His\\nboarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry.\\n“What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?” Harry\\nasked, scratching Fang’s ears.\\n“Givin’ me advice on gettin’ kelpies out of a well,”\\ngrowled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his\\n \\nscrubbed table and setting down the teapot. “Like I\\ndon’ know. An’ bangin’ on about some banshee he\\nbanished. If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle.”\\nIt was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts\\nteacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise.\\nHermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher\\nthan usual, “I think you’re being a bit unfair.\\nProfessor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the\\nbest man for the job — ”\\n“He was the on’y man for the job,” said Hagrid,\\noffering them a plate of treacle toffee, while Ron\\ncoughed squelchily into his basin. “An’ I mean the\\non’y one. Gettin’ very difficult ter find anyone fer the\\nDark Arts job. People aren’t too keen ter take it on,\\nsee. They’re startin’ ter think it’s jinxed. No one’s\\nlasted long fer a while now. So tell me,” said Hagrid,\\njerking his head at Ron. “Who was he tryin’ ter\\ncurse?”\\n“Malfoy called Hermione something — it must’ve been\\nreally bad, because everyone went wild.”\\n“It was bad,” said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the\\ntabletop looking pale and sweaty. “Malfoy called her\\n‘Mudblood,’ Hagrid — ”\\nRon dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs\\nmade their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged.\\n“He didn’!” he growled at Hermione.\\n“He did,” she said. “But I don’t know what it means. I\\ncould tell it was really rude, of course — ”\\n“It’s about the most insulting thing he could think of,”\\ngasped Ron, coming back up. “Mudblood’s a really\\nfoul name for someone who is Muggle-born — you\\n \\nknow, non-magic parents. There are some wizards —\\nlike Malfoy’s family — who think they’re better than\\neveryone else because they’re what people call pure-\\nblood.” He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell\\ninto his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin\\nand continued, “I mean, the rest of us know it doesn’t\\nmake any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom\\n— he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a\\ncauldron the right way up.”\\n“An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Hermione can’\\ndo,” said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a\\nbrilliant shade of magenta.\\n“It’s a disgusting thing to call someone,” said Ron,\\nwiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. “Dirty\\nblood, see. Common blood. It’s ridiculous. Most\\nwizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we\\nhadn’t married Muggles we’d’ve died out.”\\nHe retched and ducked out of sight again.\\n“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron,”\\nsaid Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs\\nhitting the basin. “Bu’ maybe it was a good thing yer\\nwand backfired. ’Spect Lucius Malfoy would’ve come\\nmarchin’ up ter school if yeh’d cursed his son. Least\\nyer not in trouble.”\\nHarry would have pointed out that trouble didn’t\\ncome much worse than having slugs pouring out of\\nyour mouth, but he couldn’t; Hagrid’s treacle toffee\\nhad cemented his jaws together.\\n“Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a\\nsudden thought. “Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I’ve\\nheard you’ve bin givin’ out signed photos. How come I\\nhaven’t got one?”\\n \\nFurious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.\\n“I have not been giving out signed photos,” he said\\nhotly. “If Lockhart’s still spreading that around — ”\\nBut then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.\\n“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting Harry genially on the\\nback and sending him face first into the table. “I knew\\nyeh hadn’t really. I told Lockhart yeh didn’ need teh.\\nYer more famous than him without tryin’.”\\n“Bet he didn’t like that,” said Harry, sitting up and\\nrubbing his chin.\\n“Don’ think he did,” said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling.\\n“An’ then I told him I’d never read one o’ his books an’\\nhe decided ter go. Treacle toffee, Ron?” he added as\\nRon reappeared.\\n“No thanks,” said Ron weakly. “Better not risk it.”\\n“Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said Hagrid as\\nHarry and Hermione finished the last of their tea.\\nIn the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid ’s house\\nwere a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever\\nseen. Each was the size of a large boulder.\\n“Gettin’ on well, aren’t they?” said Hagrid happily.\\n“Fer the Halloween feast ... should be big enough by\\nthen.”\\n“What’ve you been feeding them?” said Harry.\\nHagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they\\nwere alone.\\n \\n“Well, I’ve bin givin’ them — you know — a bit o’ help\\nHarry noticed Hagrid’s flowery pink umbrella leaning\\nagainst the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had\\nreason to believe before now that this umbrella was\\nnot all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression\\nthat Hagrid’s old school wand was concealed inside it.\\nHagrid wasn’t supposed to use magic. He had been\\nexpelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry\\nhad never found out why — any mention of the\\nmatter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and\\nbecome mysteriously deaf until the subject was\\nchanged.\\n“An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?” said Hermione,\\nhalfway between disapproval and amusement. “Well,\\nyou’ve done a good job on them.”\\n“That’s what yer little sister said,” said Hagrid,\\nnodding at Ron. “Met her jus’ yesterday.” Hagrid\\nlooked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. “Said\\nshe was jus’ lookin’ round the grounds, but I reckon\\nshe was hopin’ she might run inter someone else at\\nmy house.” He winked at Harry. “If yeh ask me, she\\nwouldn’ say no ter a signed — ”\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter\\nand the ground was sprayed with slugs.\\n“Watch it!” Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his\\nprecious pumpkins.\\nIt was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had\\none bit of treacle toffee since dawn, he was keen to go\\nback to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid\\nand walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing\\noccasionally, but only bringing up two very small\\nslugs.\\n \\nThey had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall\\nwhen a voice rang out, “There you are, Potter —\\nWeasley.” Professor McGonagall was walking toward\\nthem, looking stern. “You will both do your detentions\\nthis evening.”\\n“What’re we doing, Professor?” said Ron, nervously\\nsuppressing a burp.\\n“ You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room\\nwith Mr. Filch,” said Professor McGonagall. “And no\\nmagic, Weasley — elbow grease.”\\nRon gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed\\nby every student in the school.\\n“And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart\\nanswer his fan mail,” said Professor McGonagall.\\n“Oh n — Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room,\\ntoo?” said Harry desperately.\\n“Certainly not,” said Professor McGonagall, raising\\nher eyebrows. “Professor Lockhart requested you\\nparticularly. Eight o’clock sharp, both of you.”\\nHarry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states\\nof deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a\\nwell-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression.\\nHarry didn’t enjoy his shepherd’s pie as much as he’d\\nthought. Both he and Ron felt they’d got the worse\\ndeal.\\n“Filch ’ll have me there all night,” said Ron heavily.\\n“No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in\\nthat room. I’m no good at Muggle cleaning.”\\n \\n“I’d swap anytime,” said Harry hollowly. “I’ve had\\nloads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering\\nLockhart’s fan mail ... he’ll be a nightmare. ...”\\nSaturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what\\nseemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and\\nHarry was dragging his feet along the second-floor\\ncorridor to Lockhart’s office. He gritted his teeth and\\nknocked.\\nThe door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at\\nhim.\\n“Ah, here’s the scalawag!” he said. “Come in, Harry,\\ncome in — ”\\nShining brightly on the walls by the light of many\\ncandles were countless framed photographs of\\nLockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another\\nlarge pile lay on his desk.\\n“You can address the envelopes!” Lockhart told Harry,\\nas though this was a huge treat. “This first one’s to\\nGladys Gudgeon, bless her — huge fan of mine — ”\\nThe minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart’s voice\\nwash over him, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and\\n“Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then he caught a phrase\\nlike, “Fame’s a fickle friend, Harry,” or “Celebrity is as\\ncelebrity does, remember that.”\\nThe candles burned lower and lower, making the light\\ndance over the many moving faces of Lockhart\\nwatching him. Harry moved his aching hand over\\nwhat felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out\\nVeronica Smethley’s address. It must be nearly time to\\nleave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly\\ntime. ...\\n \\nAnd then he heard something — something quite\\napart from the spitting of the dying candles and\\nLockhart’s prattle about his fans.\\nIt was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a\\nvoice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom.\\n“Come ... come to me. ... Let me rip you. ... Let me tear\\nyou. ... Let me kill you. ...”\\nHarry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot\\nappeared on Veronica Smethley’s street.\\n“What?” he said loudly.\\n“I know!” said Lockhart. “Six solid months at the top\\nof the best-seller list! Broke all records!”\\n“No,” said Harry frantically. “That voice!”\\n“Sorry?” said Lockhart, looking puzzled. “What voice?”\\n“That — that voice that said — didn’t you hear it?”\\nLockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.\\n“What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you’re\\ngetting a little drowsy? Great Scott — look at the time!\\n“We’ve been here nearly four hours! I’d never have\\nbelieved it — the time’s flown, hasn’t it?”\\nHarry didn’t answer. He was straining his ears to hear\\nthe voice again, but there was no sound now except\\nfor Lockhart telling him he mustn’t expect a treat like\\nthis every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry\\nleft.\\nIt was so late that the Gryffindor common room was\\nalmost empty. Harry went straight up to the\\n \\ndormitory. Ron wasn’t back yet. Harry pulled on his\\npajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later,\\nRon arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a\\nstrong smell of polish into the darkened room.\\n“My muscles have all seized up,” he groaned, sinking\\non his bed. “Fourteen times he made me buff up that\\nQuidditch Cup before he was satisfied. And then I\\nhad another slug attack all over a Special Award for\\nServices to the School. Took ages to get the slime off.\\n. . . How was it with Lockhart?”\\nKeeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean,\\nand Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had\\nheard.\\n“And Lockhart said he couldn’t hear it?” said Ron.\\nHarry could see him frowning in the moonlight.\\n“D’you think he was lying? But I don’t get it — even\\nsomeone invisible would’ve had to open the door.”\\n“I know,” said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and\\nstaring at the canopy above him. “I don’t get it either.”\\n \\nd\\nTHE DEATHDAY PARTY\\nOctober arrived, spreading a damp chill over the\\ngrounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the\\nnurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds\\namong the staff and students. Her Pepperup Potion\\nworked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking\\nat the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny\\nWeasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into\\ntaking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under\\nher vivid hair gave the impression that her whole\\nhead was on fire.\\nRaindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle\\nwindows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower\\nbeds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid’s\\npumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver\\nWood’s enthusiasm for regular training sessions,\\nhowever, was not dampened, which was why Harry\\nwas to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon\\na few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor\\nTower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.\\nEven aside from the rain and wind it hadn’t been a\\nhappy practice session. Fred and George, who had\\n \\nbeen spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for\\nthemselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two\\nThousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin\\nteam was no more than seven greenish blurs,\\nshooting through the air like missiles.\\nAs Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he\\ncame across somebody who looked just as\\npreoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the\\nghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of\\na window, muttering under his breath, \"... don’t fulfill\\ntheir requirements ... half an inch, if that ...”\\n“Hello, Nick,” said Harry.\\n“Hello, hello,” said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and\\nlooking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his\\nlong curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which\\nconcealed the fact that his neck was almost\\ncompletely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry\\ncould see right through him to the dark sky and\\ntorrential rain outside.\\n“You look troubled, young Potter,” said Nick, folding a\\ntransparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside\\nhis doublet.\\n“So do you,” said Harry.\\n“Ah,” Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, “a\\nmatter of no importance. ... It’s not as though I really\\nwanted to join. ... Thought I’d apply, but apparently I\\n‘don’t fulfill requirements’ — ”\\nIn spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great\\nbitterness on his face.\\n“But you would think, wouldn’t you,” he erupted\\nsuddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket,\\n \\n“that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a\\nblunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless\\nHunt?”\\n“Oh — yes,” said Harry, who was obviously supposed\\nto agree.\\n“I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all\\nbeen quick and clean, and my head had come off\\nproperly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal\\nof pain and ridicule. However — ” Nearly Headless\\nNick shook his letter open and read furiously:\\n“ ‘We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have\\nparted company with their bodies. You will appreciate\\nthat it would be impossible otherwise for members to\\nparticipate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-\\nJuggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret,\\ntherefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill\\nour requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick\\nDelaney -Podmore.’ ”\\nFuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.\\n“Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on,\\nHarry! Most people would think that’s good and\\nbeheaded, but oh, no, it’s not enough for Sir Properly\\nDecapitated-Podmore . ”\\nNearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and\\nthen said, in a far calmer tone, “So — what’s\\nbothering you? Anything I can do?”\\n“No,” said Harry. “Not unless you know where we can\\nget seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for\\nour match against Sly — ”\\nThe rest of Harry’s sentence was drowned out by a\\nhigh-pitched mewling from somewhere near his\\n \\nankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into\\na pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the\\nskeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker,\\nArgus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle\\nagainst students.\\n“You’d better get out of here, Harry,” said Nick\\nquickly. “Filch isn’t in a good mood — he’s got the flu\\nand some third years accidentally plastered frog\\nbrains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He’s been\\ncleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud\\nall over the place — ”\\n“Right,” said Harry, backing away from the accusing\\nstare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn\\nto the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to\\nconnect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst\\nsuddenly through a tapestry to Harry’s right,\\nwheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-\\nbreaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around\\nhis head, and his nose was unusually purple.\\n“Filth!” he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes\\npopping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy\\npuddle that had dripped from Harry’s Quidditch\\nrobes. “Mess and muck everywhere! I’ve had enough\\nof it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!”\\nSo Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless\\nNick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the\\nnumber of muddy footprints on the floor.\\nHarry had never been inside Filch’s office before; it\\nwas a place most students avoided. The room was\\ndingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp\\ndangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried\\nfish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets\\nstood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could\\nsee that they contained details of every pupil Filch\\n \\nhad ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an\\nentire drawer to themselves. A highly polished\\ncollection of chains and manacles hung on the wall\\nbehind Filch’s desk. It was common knowledge that\\nhe was always begging Dumbledore to let him\\nsuspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.\\nFilch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and\\nbegan shuffling around looking for parchment.\\n“Dung,” he muttered furiously, “great sizzling dragon\\nbogies ... frog brains ... rat intestines ... I’ve had\\nenough of it ... make an example ... where’s the form\\n... yes ...”\\nHe retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk\\ndrawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping\\nhis long black quill into the ink pot.\\n“ Name ... Harry Potter. Crime ...”\\n“It was only a bit of mud!” said Harry.\\n“It’s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it’s an\\nextra hour scrubbing!” shouted Filch, a drip shivering\\nunpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. “Crime\\n... befouling the castle ... suggested sentence ...”\\nDabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted\\nunpleasantly at Harry, who waited with bated breath\\nfor his sentence to fall.\\nBut as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great\\nBANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil\\nlamp rattle.\\n“PEEVES!” Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a\\ntransport of rage. “I’ll have you this time, I’ll have\\nyou!”\\n \\nAnd without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran\\nflat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking\\nalongside him.\\nPeeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne\\nmenace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry\\ndidn’t much like Peeves, but couldn’t help feeling\\ngrateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves\\nhad done (and it sounded as though he’d wrecked\\nsomething very big this time) would distract Filch\\nfrom Harry.\\nThinking that he should probably wait for Filch to\\ncome back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next\\nto the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from\\nhis half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple\\nenvelope with silver lettering on the front. With a\\nquick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn’t on\\nhis way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read:\\nKWIKSPELL\\nA Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic\\nIntrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled\\nout the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver\\nwriting on the front page said:\\nFeel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find\\nyourself making excuses not to perform simple spells?\\nEver been taunted for your woeful wandwork?\\nThere is an answer!\\nKwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-\\nlearn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have\\nbenefited from the Kwikspell method!\\nMadam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes:\\n \\n“I had no memory for incantations and my potions\\nwere a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am\\nthe center of attention at parties and friends beg for the\\nrecipe of my Scintillation Solution!”\\nWarlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says:\\n“My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one\\nmonth into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I\\nsucceeded in turning her into a yak!\\nThank you, Kwikspell!”\\nFascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the\\nenvelope’s contents. Why on earth did Filch want a\\nKwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn’t a proper\\nwizard? Harry was just reading “Lesson One: Holding\\nYour Wand (Some Useful Tips)” when shuffling\\nfootsteps outside told him Filch was coming back.\\nStuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry\\nthrew it back onto the desk just as the door opened.\\nFilch was looking triumphant.\\n“That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he\\nwas saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. “We’ll have Peeves\\nout this time, my sweet — ”\\nHis eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the\\nKwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late,\\nwas lying two feet away from where it had started.\\nFilch ’s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced\\nhimself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across\\nto his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it\\ninto a drawer.\\n“Have you — did you read — ?” he sputtered.\\n \\n“No,” Harry lied quickly.\\nFilch ’s knobbly hands were twisting together.\\n“If I thought you’d read my private — not that it’s\\nmine — for a friend — be that as it may — however —\\nHarry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never\\nlooked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was\\ngoing in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan\\nscarf didn’t help.\\n“Very well — go — and don’t breathe a word — not\\nthat — however, if you didn’t read — go now, I have to\\nwrite up Peeves’ report — go — ”\\nAmazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up\\nthe corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from\\nFilch ’s office without punishment was probably some\\nkind of school record.\\n“Harry! Harry! Did it work?”\\nNearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom.\\nBehind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large\\nblack-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been\\ndropped from a great height.\\n“I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch’s\\noffice,” said Nick eagerly. “Thought it might distract\\nhim — ”\\n“Was that you?” said Harry gratefully. “Yeah, it\\nworked, I didn’t even get detention. Thanks, Nick!”\\nThey set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless\\nNick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick’s\\nrejection letter.\\n \\n“I wish there was something I could do for you about\\nthe Headless Hunt,” Harry said.\\nNearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry\\nwalked right through him. He wished he hadn’t; it\\nwas like stepping through an icy shower.\\n“But there is something you could do for me,” said\\nNick excitedly. “Harry — would I be asking too much\\n— but no, you wouldn’t want — ”\\n“What is it?” said Harry.\\n“Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth\\ndeathday,” said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing\\nhimself up and looking dignified.\\n“Oh,” said Harry, not sure whether he should look\\nsorry or happy about this. “Right.”\\n“I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier\\ndungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the\\ncountry. It would be such an honor if you would\\nattend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most\\nwelcome, too, of course — but I daresay you’d rather\\ngo to the school feast?” He watched Harry on\\ntenterhooks.\\n“No,” said Harry quickly, “I’ll come — ”\\n“My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party!\\nAnd” — he hesitated, looking excited — “do you think\\nyou could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very\\nfrightening and impressive you find me?”\\n“Of — of course,” said Harry.\\nNearly Headless Nick beamed at him.\\n \\n“A deathday party?” said Hermione keenly when\\nHarry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in\\nthe common room. “I bet there aren’t many living\\npeople who can say they’ve been to one of those — it’ll\\nbe fascinating!”\\n“Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they\\ndied?” said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions\\nhomework and grumpy. “Sounds dead depressing to\\nme....”\\nRain was still lashing the windows, which were now\\ninky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful.\\nThe firelight glowed over the countless squashy\\narmchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing\\nhomework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley,\\ntrying to find out what would happen if you fed a\\nFilibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had\\n“rescued” the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard\\nfrom a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was\\nnow smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a\\nknot of curious people.\\nHarry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione\\nabout Filch and the Kwikspell course when the\\nsalamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting\\nloud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the\\nroom. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at\\nFred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine\\nstars showering from the salamander’s mouth, and its\\nescape into the fire, with accompanying explosions,\\ndrove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from\\nHarry’s mind.\\nBy the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting\\nhis rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest\\nof the school was happily anticipating their Halloween\\nfeast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the\\nusual live bats, Hagrid’s vast pumpkins had been\\n \\ncarved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit\\nin, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had\\nbooked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the\\nentertainment.\\n“A promise is a promise,” Hermione reminded Harry\\nbossily. “You said you’d go to the deathday party.”\\nSo at seven o’clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked\\nstraight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall,\\nwhich was glittering invitingly with gold plates and\\ncandles, and directed their steps instead toward the\\ndungeons.\\nThe passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick’s\\nparty had been lined with candles, too, though the\\neffect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin,\\njet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a\\ndim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The\\ntemperature dropped with every step they took. As\\nHarry shivered and drew his robes tightly around\\nhim, he heard what sounded like a thousand\\nfingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.\\n“Is that supposed to be music?” Ron whispered. They\\nturned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick\\nstanding at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.\\n“My dear friends,” he said mournfully. “Welcome,\\nwelcome ... so pleased you could come. ...”\\nHe swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.\\nIt was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of\\nhundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly\\ndrifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the\\ndreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws,\\nplayed by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped\\nplatform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue\\n \\nwith a thousand more black candles. Their breath\\nrose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a\\nfreezer.\\n“Shall we have a look around?” Harry suggested,\\nwanting to warm up his feet.\\n“Careful not to walk through anyone,” said Ron\\nnervously, and they set off around the edge of the\\ndance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a\\nragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a\\ncheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight\\nwith an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry\\nwasn’t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a\\ngaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver\\nbloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the\\nother ghosts.\\n“Oh, no,” said Hermione, stopping abruptly. “Turn\\nback, turn back, I don’t want to talk to Moaning\\nMyrtle — ”\\n“Who?” said Harry as they backtracked quickly.\\n“She haunts one of the toilets in the girls’ bathroom\\non the first floor,” said Hermione.\\n“She haunts a toilet ?”\\n“Yes. It’s been out-of-order all year because she keeps\\nhaving tantrums and flooding the place. I never went\\nin there anyway if I could avoid it; it’s awful trying to\\nhave a pee with her wailing at you — ”\\n“Look, food!” said Ron.\\nOn the other side of the dungeon was a long table,\\nalso covered in black velvet. They approached it\\neagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks,\\n \\nhorrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large,\\nrotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters;\\ncakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on\\nsalvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of\\ncheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of\\nplace, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a\\ntombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words,\\nSIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON\\nDIED 3 1 ST OCTOBER, 1 492\\nHarry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached\\nthe table, crouched low, and walked through it, his\\nmouth held wide so that it passed through one of the\\nstinking salmon.\\n“Can you taste it if you walk through it?” Harry asked\\nhim.\\n“Almost,” said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.\\n“I expect they’ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,”\\nsaid Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and\\nleaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.\\n“Can we move? I feel sick,” said Ron.\\nThey had barely turned around, however, when a\\nlittle man swooped suddenly from under the table and\\ncame to a halt in midair before them.\\n“Hello, Peeves,” said Harry cautiously.\\nUnlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist\\nwas the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was\\nwearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie,\\nand a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.\\n \\n“Nibbles?” he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of\\npeanuts covered in fungus.\\n“No thanks,” said Hermione.\\n“Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,” said Peeves,\\nhis eyes dancing. “Rude you was about poor Myrtle.”\\nHe took a deep breath and bellowed, “OY! MYRTLE!”\\n“Oh, no, Peeves, don’t tell her what I said, she’ll be\\nreally upset,” Hermione whispered frantically. “I didn’t\\nmean it, I don’t mind her — er, hello, Myrtle.”\\nThe squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the\\nglummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden\\nbehind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.\\n“What?” she said sulkily.\\n“How are you, Myrtle?” said Hermione in a falsely\\nbright voice. “It’s nice to see you out of the toilet.”\\nMyrtle sniffed.\\n“Miss Granger was just talking about you — ” said\\nPeeves slyly in Myrtle’s ear.\\n“Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight,”\\nsaid Hermione, glaring at Peeves.\\nMyrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.\\n“You’re making fun of me,” she said, silver tears\\nwelling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes.\\n“No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s\\nlooking?” said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron\\npainfully in the ribs.\\n \\n“Oh, yeah — ”\\n“She did — ”\\n“Don’t lie to me,” Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding\\ndown her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her\\nshoulder. “D’you think I don’t know what people call\\nme behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle!\\nMiserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!”\\n“You’ve forgotten pimply,” Peeves hissed in her ear.\\nMoaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled\\nfrom the dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting her\\nwith moldy peanuts, yelling, “Pimply\\\\ Pimplyl”\\n“Oh, dear,” said Hermione sadly.\\nNearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them\\nthrough the crowd.\\n“Enjoying yourselves?”\\n“Oh, yes,” they lied.\\n“Not a bad turnout,” said Nearly Headless Nick\\nproudly. “The Wailing Widow came all the way up\\nfrom Kent. ... It’s nearly time for my speech, I’d better\\ngo and warn the orchestra. ...”\\nThe orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very\\nmoment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell\\nsilent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting\\nhorn sounded.\\n“Oh, here we go,” said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.\\nThrough the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost\\nhorses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The\\n \\nassembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too,\\nbut stopped quickly at the sight of Nick’s face.\\nThe horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor\\nand halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the\\npack was a large ghost who held his bearded head\\nunder his arm, from which position he was blowing\\nthe horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high\\nin the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone\\nlaughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick,\\nsquashing his head back onto his neck.\\n“Nick!” he roared. “How are you? Head still hanging in\\nthere?”\\nHe gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless\\nNick on the shoulder.\\n“Welcome, Patrick,” said Nick stiffly.\\n“Live ’uns!” said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione and giving a huge, fake jump of\\nastonishment, so that his head fell off again (the\\ncrowd howled with laughter).\\n“Very amusing,” said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.\\n“Don’t mind Nick!” shouted Sir Patrick’s head from\\nthe floor. “Still upset we won’t let him join the Hunt!\\nBut I mean to say — look at the fellow — ”\\n“I think,” said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look\\nfrom Nick, “Nick’s very — frightening and — er — ”\\n“Ha!” yelled Sir Patrick’s head. “Bet he asked you to\\nsay that!”\\n“If I could have everyone’s attention, it’s time for my\\nspeech!” said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding\\n \\ntoward the podium and climbing into an icy blue\\nspotlight.\\n“My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is\\nmy great sorrow ...”\\nBut nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the\\nrest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of\\nHead Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch.\\nNearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his\\naudience, but gave up as Sir Patrick’s head went\\nsailing past him to loud cheers.\\nHarry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.\\n“I can’t stand much more of this,” Ron muttered, his\\nteeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into\\naction and the ghosts swept back onto the dance\\nfloor.\\n“Let’s go,” Harry agreed.\\nThey backed toward the door, nodding and beaming\\nat anyone who looked at them, and a minute later\\nwere hurrying back up the passageway full of black\\ncandles.\\n“Pudding might not be finished yet,” said Ron\\nhopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the\\nentrance hall.\\nAnd then Harry heard it.\\n\"... rip ... tear ... kill ...”\\nIt was the same voice, the same cold, murderous\\nvoice he had heard in Lockhart’s office.\\n \\nHe stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall,\\nlistening with all his might, looking around, squinting\\nup and down the dimly lit passageway.\\n“Harry, what’re you — ?”\\n“It’s that voice again — shut up a minute — ”\\nsoo hungry ... for so long ...”\\n“Listen!” said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione\\nfroze, watching him.\\n“... kill ... time to kill ...”\\nThe voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was\\nmoving away — moving upward. A mixture of fear and\\nexcitement gripped him as he stared at the dark\\nceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a\\nphantom, to whom stone ceilings didn’t matter?\\n“This way,” he shouted, and he began to run, up the\\nstairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to\\nhear anything here, the babble of talk from the\\nHalloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall.\\nHarry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first\\nfloor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.\\n“Harry, what’re we — ”\\n“SHH!”\\nHarry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor\\nabove, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice:\\n“...I smell blood. ...I SMELL BLOOD\\\\”\\nHis stomach lurched —\\n \\n“It’s going to kill someone!” he shouted, and ignoring\\nRon’s and Hermione’s bewildered faces, he ran up the\\nnext flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen\\nover his own pounding footsteps —\\nHarry hurtled around the whole of the second floor,\\nRon and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping\\nuntil they turned a corner into the last, deserted\\npassage.\\n“Harry, what was that all about?” said Ron, wiping\\nsweat off his face. “I couldn’t hear anything. ...”\\nBut Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the\\ncorridor.\\n“Loo/c!”\\nSomething was shining on the wall ahead. They\\napproached slowly, squinting through the darkness.\\nFoot-high words had been daubed on the wall\\nbetween two windows, shimmering in the light cast by\\nthe flaming torches.\\nTHE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED.\\nENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.\\n“What’s that thing — hanging underneath?” said Ron,\\na slight quiver in his voice.\\nAs they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped — there\\nwas a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and\\nHermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the\\nmessage, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All\\nthree of them realized what it was at once, and leapt\\nbackward with a splash.\\n \\nMrs. Norris, the caretaker’s cat, was hanging by her\\ntail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board,\\nher eyes wide and staring.\\nFor a few seconds, they didn’t move. Then Ron said,\\n“Let’s get out of here.”\\n“Shouldn’t we try and help — ” Harry began\\nawkwardly.\\n“Trust me,” said Ron. “We don’t want to be found\\nhere.”\\nBut it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant\\nthunder, told them that the feast had just ended.\\nFrom either end of the corridor where they stood\\ncame the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the\\nstairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people;\\nnext moment, students were crashing into the\\npassage from both ends.\\nThe chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as\\nthe people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the\\ncorridor, as silence fell among the mass of students\\npressing forward to see the grisly sight.\\nThen someone shouted through the quiet.\\n“Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next,\\nMudbloods!”\\nIt was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of\\nthe crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless\\nface flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the\\nhanging, immobile cat.\\n \\n9\\nTHE WRITING ON THE WALL\\n“What’s going on here? What’s going on?”\\nAttracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch\\ncame shouldering his way through the crowd. Then\\nhe saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in\\nhorror.\\n“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he\\nshrieked.\\nAnd his popping eyes fell on Harry.\\n“You!” he screeched. “You! You’ve murdered my cat!\\nYou’ve killed her! I’ll kill you! I’ll — ”\\n“Argus\\'.”\\nDumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a\\nnumber of other teachers. In seconds, he had swept\\npast Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs.\\nNorris from the torch bracket.\\n \\n“Come with me, Argus,” he said to Filch. “You, too,\\nMr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.”\\nLockhart stepped forward eagerly.\\n“My office is nearest, Headmaster — just upstairs —\\nplease feel free — ”\\n“Thank you, Gilderoy,” said Dumbledore.\\nThe silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart,\\nlooking excited and important, hurried after\\nDumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and\\nSnape.\\nAs they entered Lockhart’s darkened office there was\\na flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw\\nseveral of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of\\nsight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit the\\ncandles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore laid\\nMrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to\\nexamine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged\\ntense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of\\ncandlelight, watching.\\nThe tip of Dumbledore ’s long, crooked nose was\\nbarely an inch from Mrs. Norris’s fur. He was looking\\nat her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his\\nlong fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor\\nMcGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes\\nnarrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in\\nshadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was\\nas though he was trying hard not to smile. And\\nLockhart was hovering around all of them, making\\nsuggestions.\\n“It was definitely a curse that killed her — probably\\nthe Trans-mogrifian Torture — I’ve seen it used many\\n \\ntimes, so unlucky I wasn’t there, I know the very\\ncountercurse that would have saved her. ...”\\nLockhart’s comments were punctuated by Filch ’s dry,\\nracking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk,\\nunable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands.\\nMuch as he detested Filch, Harry couldn’t help feeling\\na bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he\\nfelt for himself. If Dumbledore believed Filch, he\\nwould be expelled for sure.\\nDumbledore was now muttering strange words under\\nhis breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but\\nnothing happened: She continued to look as though\\nshe had been recently stuffed.\\n\"... I remember something very similar happening in\\nOuagadougou,” said Lockhart, “a series of attacks,\\nthe full story’s in my autobiography, I was able to\\nprovide the townsfolk with various amulets, which\\ncleared the matter up at once. ...”\\nThe photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all\\nnodding in agreement as he talked. One of them had\\nforgotten to remove his hair net.\\nAt last Dumbledore straightened up.\\n“She’s not dead, Argus,” he said softly.\\nLockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting\\nthe number of murders he had prevented.\\n“Not dead?” choked Filch, looking through his fingers\\nat Mrs. Norris. “But why’s she all — all stiff and\\nfrozen?”\\n \\n“She has been Petrified,” said Dumbledore (“Ah! I\\nthought so!” said Lockhart). “But how, I cannot say.\\n“Ask him\\\\” shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and\\ntearstained face to Harry.\\n“No second year could have done this,” said\\nDumbledore firmly. “It would take Dark Magic of the\\nmost advanced — ”\\n“He did it, he did it!” Filch spat, his pouchy face\\npurpling. “You saw what he wrote on the wall! He\\nfound — in my office — he knows I’m a — I’m a — ”\\nFilch ’s face worked horribly. “He knows I’m a Squib!”\\nhe finished.\\n“I never touched Mrs. Norris!” Harry said loudly,\\nuncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him,\\nincluding all the Lockharts on the walls. “And I don’t\\neven know what a Squib is.”\\n“Rubbish!” snarled Filch. “He saw my Kwikspell\\nletter!”\\n“If I might speak, Headmaster,” said Snape from the\\nshadows, and Harry’s sense of foreboding increased;\\nhe was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to\\ndo him any good.\\n“Potter and his friends may have simply been in the\\nwrong place at the wrong time,” he said, a slight sneer\\ncurling his mouth as though he doubted it. “But we\\ndo have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why\\nwas he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn’t he\\nat the Halloween feast?”\\n \\nHarry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an\\nexplanation about the deathday party. \"... there were\\nhundreds of ghosts, they’ll tell you we were there — ”\\n“But why not join the feast afterward?” said Snape,\\nhis black eyes glittering in the candlelight. “Why go\\nup to that corridor?”\\nRon and Hermione looked at Harry.\\n“Because — because — ” Harry said, his heart\\nthumping very fast; something told him it would\\nsound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led\\nthere by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,\\n“because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,” he\\nsaid.\\n“Without any supper?” said Snape, a triumphant\\nsmile flickering across his gaunt face. “I didn’t think\\nghosts provided food fit for living people at their\\nparties.”\\n“We weren’t hungry,” said Ron loudly as his stomach\\ngave a huge rumble.\\nSnape’s nasty smile widened.\\n“I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being\\nentirely truthful,” he said. “It might be a good idea if\\nhe were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready\\nto tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should\\nbe taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is\\nready to be honest.”\\n“Really, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall sharply,\\n“I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch.\\nThis cat wasn’t hit over the head with a broomstick.\\nThere is no evidence at all that Potter has done\\nanything wrong.”\\n \\nDumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His\\ntwinkling light-blue gaze made Harry feel as though\\nhe were being X-rayed.\\n“Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,” he said\\nfirmly.\\nSnape looked furious. So did Filch.\\n“My cat has been Petrified!” he shrieked, his eyes\\npopping. “I want to see some punishmenti”\\n“We will be able to cure her, Argus,” said Dumbledore\\npatiently. “Professer Sprout recently managed to\\nprocure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have\\nreached their full size, I will have a potion made that\\nwill revive Mrs. Norris.”\\n“I’ll make it,” Lockhart butted in. “I must have done it\\na hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake\\nRestorative Draught in my sleep — ”\\n“Excuse me,” said Snape icily. “But I believe I am the\\nPotions master at this school.”\\nThere was a very awkward pause.\\n“You may go,” Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione.\\nThey went, as quickly as they could without actually\\nrunning. When they were a floor up from Lockhart’s\\noffice, they turned into an empty classroom and\\nclosed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted\\nat his friends’ darkened faces.\\n“D’you think I should have told them about that voice\\nI heard?”\\n \\n“No,” said Ron, without hesitation. “Hearing voices no\\none else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the\\nwizarding world.”\\nSomething in Ron’s voice made Harry ask, “You do\\nbelieve me, don’t you?”\\n“ ’Course I do,” said Ron quickly. “But — you must\\nadmit it’s weird. ...”\\n“I know it’s weird,” said Harry. “The whole thing’s\\nweird. What was that writing on the wall about? The\\nChamber Has Been Opened’. ... What’s that supposed\\nto mean?”\\n“You know, it rings a sort of bell,” said Ron slowly. “I\\nthink someone told me a story about a secret\\nchamber at Hogwarts once ... might’ve been Bill. ...”\\n“And what on earth’s a Squib?” said Harry.\\nTo his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.\\n“Well — it’s not funny really — but as it’s Filch,” he\\nsaid. “A Squib is someone who was born into a\\nwizarding family but hasn’t got any magic powers.\\nKind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but\\nSquibs are quite unusual. If Filch ’s trying to learn\\nmagic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a\\nSquib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates\\nstudents so much.” Ron gave a satisfied smile. “He’s\\nbitter.”\\nA clock chimed somewhere.\\n“Midnight,” said Harry. “We’d better get to bed before\\nSnape comes along and tries to frame us for\\nsomething else.”\\n \\nFor a few days, the school could talk of little else but\\nthe attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in\\neveryone’s minds by pacing the spot where she had\\nbeen attacked, as though he thought the attacker\\nmight come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the\\nmessage on the wall with Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose\\nMagical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words\\nstill gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When\\nFilch wasn’t guarding the scene of the crime, he was\\nskulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out\\nat unsuspecting students and trying to put them in\\ndetention for things like “breathing loudly” and\\n“looking happy.”\\nGinny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs.\\nNorris’s fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat\\nlover.\\n“But you haven’t really got to know Mrs. Norris,” Ron\\ntold her bracingly. “Honestly, we’re much better off\\nwithout her.” Ginny ’s lip trembled. “Stuff like this\\ndoesn’t often happen at Hogwarts,” Ron assured her.\\n“They’ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out\\nof here in no time. I just hope he’s got time to Petrify\\nFilch before he’s expelled. I’m only joking — ” Ron\\nadded hastily as Ginny blanched.\\nThe attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was\\nquite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time\\nreading, but she was now doing almost nothing else.\\nNor could Harry and Ron get much response from her\\nwhen they asked what she was up to, and not until\\nthe following Wednesday did they find out.\\nHarry had been held back in Potions, where Snape\\nhad made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off\\n \\nthe desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to\\nmeet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-\\nFletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming\\ntoward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say\\nhello when Justin caught sight of him, turned\\nabruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.\\nHarry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring\\nhis History of Magic homework. Professor Binns had\\nasked for a three-foot-long composition on “The\\nMedieval Assembly of European Wizards.”\\n“I don’t believe it, I’m still eight inches short. ...” said\\nRon furiously, letting go of his parchment, which\\nsprang back into a roll. “And Hermione’s done four\\nfeet seven inches and her writing’s tiny.”\\n“Where is she?” asked Harry, grabbing the tape\\nmeasure and unrolling his own homework.\\n“Somewhere over there,” said Ron, pointing along the\\nshelves. “Looking for another book. I think she’s\\ntrying to read the whole library before Christmas.”\\nHarry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running\\naway from him.\\n“Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an\\nidiot,” said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing\\nas large as possible. “All that junk about Lockhart\\nbeing so great — ”\\nHermione emerged from between the bookshelves.\\nShe looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk\\nto them.\\n“All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken\\nout,” she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron.\\n“And there’s a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn’t\\n \\nleft my copy at home, but I couldn’t fit it in my trunk\\nwith all the Lockhart books.”\\n“Why do you want it?” said Harry.\\n“The same reason everyone else wants it,” said\\nHermione, “to read up on the legend of the Chamber\\nof Secrets.”\\n“What’s that?” said Harry quickly.\\n“That’s just it. I can’t remember,” said Hermione,\\nbiting her lip. “And I can’t find the story anywhere\\nelse — ”\\n“Hermione, let me read your composition,” said Ron\\ndesperately, checking his watch.\\n“No, I won’t,” said Hermione, suddenly severe. “You’ve\\nhad ten days to finish it — ”\\n“I only need another two inches, come on — ”\\nThe bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to\\nHistory of Magic, bickering.\\nHistory of Magic was the dullest subject on their\\nschedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their\\nonly ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that\\never happened in his classes was his entering the\\nroom through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled,\\nmany people said he hadn’t noticed he was dead. He\\nhad simply got up to teach one day and left his body\\nbehind him in an armchair in front of the staffroom\\nfire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.\\nToday was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened\\nhis notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old\\nvacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was\\n \\nin a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough\\nto copy down a name or date, then falling asleep\\nagain. He had been speaking for half an hour when\\nsomething happened that had never happened before.\\nHermione put up her hand.\\nProfessor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly\\ndull lecture on the International Warlock Convention\\nof 1289, looked amazed.\\n“Miss — er — ?”\\n“Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell\\nus anything about the Chamber of Secrets,” said\\nHermione in a clear voice.\\nDean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth\\nhanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of\\nhis trance; Lavender Brown’s head came up off her\\narms and Neville Longbottom’s elbow slipped off his\\ndesk.\\nProfessor Binns blinked.\\n“My subject is History of Magic,” he said in his dry,\\nwheezy voice. “I deal with, facts, Miss Granger, not\\nmyths and legends.” He cleared his throat with a\\nsmall noise like chalk snapping and continued, “In\\nSeptember of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian\\nsorcerers — ”\\nHe stuttered to a halt. Hermione’s hand was waving\\nin the air again.\\n“Miss Grant?”\\n“Please, sir, don’t legends always have a basis in\\nfact?”\\n \\nProfessor Binns was looking at her in such\\namazement, Harry was sure no student had ever\\ninterrupted him before, alive or dead.\\n“Well,” said Professor Binns slowly, “yes, one could\\nargue that, I suppose.” He peered at Hermione as\\nthough he had never seen a student properly before.\\n“However, the legend of which you speak is such a\\nvery sensational, even ludicrous tale — ”\\nBut the whole class was now hanging on Professor\\nBinns ’s every word. He looked dimly at them all, every\\nface turned to his. Harry could tell he was completely\\nthrown by such an unusual show of interest.\\n“Oh, very well,” he said slowly. “Let me see ... the\\nChamber of Secrets . . .\\n“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded\\nover a thousand years ago — the precise date is\\nuncertain — by the four greatest witches and wizards\\nof the age. The four school Houses are named after\\nthem: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena\\nRavenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this\\ncastle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was\\nan age when magic was feared by common people,\\nand witches and wizards suffered much persecution.”\\nHe paused, gazed blearily around the room, and\\ncontinued.\\n“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony\\ntogether, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of\\nmagic and bringing them to the castle to be educated.\\nBut then disagreements sprang up between them. A\\nrift began to grow between Slytherin and the others.\\nSlytherin wished to be more selective about the\\nstudents admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that\\nmagical learning should be kept within all-magic\\n \\nfamilies. He disliked taking students of Muggle\\nparentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After\\na while, there was a serious argument on the subject\\nbetween Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left\\nthe school.”\\nProfessor Binns paused again, pursing his lips,\\nlooking like a wrinkled old tortoise.\\n“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he\\nsaid. “But these honest facts have been obscured by\\nthe fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The\\nstory goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber\\nin the castle, of which the other founders knew\\nnothing.\\n“Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the\\nChamber of Secrets so that none would be able to\\nopen it until his own true heir arrived at the school.\\nThe heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber\\nof Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to\\npurge the school of all who were unworthy to study\\nmagic.”\\nThere was silence as he finished telling the story, but\\nit wasn’t the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor\\nBinns ’s classes. There was unease in the air as\\neveryone continued to watch him, hoping for more.\\nProfessor Binns looked faintly annoyed.\\n“The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,” he\\nsaid. “Naturally, the school has been searched for\\nevidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most\\nlearned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale\\ntold to frighten the gullible.”\\nHermione’s hand was back in the air.\\n \\n“Sir — what exactly do you mean by the ‘horror\\nwithin’ the Chamber?”\\n“That is believed to be some sort of monster, which\\nthe Heir of Slytherin alone can control,” said Professor\\nBinns in his dry, reedy voice.\\nThe class exchanged nervous looks.\\n“I tell you, the thing does not exist,” said Professor\\nBinns, shuffling his notes. “There is no Chamber and\\nno monster.”\\n“But, sir,” said Seamus Finnigan, “if the Chamber can\\nonly be opened by Slytherin’s true heir, no one else\\nwould be able to find it, would they?”\\n“Nonsense, O’Flaherty,” said Professor Binns in an\\naggravated tone. “If a long succession of Hogwarts\\nheadmasters and headmistresses haven’t found the\\nthing — ”\\n“But, Professor,” piped up Parvati Patil, “you’d\\nprobably have to use Dark Magic to open it — ”\\n“Just because a wizard doesn’t use Dark Magic\\ndoesn’t mean he can’t, Miss Pennyfeather,” snapped\\nProfessor Binns. “I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore\\n“But maybe you’ve got to be related to Slytherin, so\\nDumbledore couldn’t — ” began Dean Thomas, but\\nProfessor Binns had had enough.\\n“That will do,” he said sharply. “It is a myth! It does\\nnot exist! There is not a shred of evidence that\\nSlytherin ever built so much as a secret broom\\ncupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We\\n \\nwill return, if you please, to history, to solid,\\nbelievable, verifiable facti”\\nAnd within five minutes, the class had sunk back into\\nits usual torpor.\\n“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old\\nloony,” Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought\\ntheir way through the teeming corridors at the end of\\nthe lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I\\nnever knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I\\nwouldn’t be in his House if you paid me. Honestly, if\\nthe Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve\\ngot the train straight back home. ...”\\nHermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say\\nanything. His stomach had just dropped\\nunpleasantly.\\nHarry had never told Ron and Hermione that the\\nSorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in\\nSlytherin. He could remember, as though it were\\nyesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear\\nwhen he’d placed the hat on his head a year before:\\nYou could be great, you know, it’s all here in your\\nhead, and Slytherin would help you on the way to\\ngreatness, no doubt about that. . . .\\nBut Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin\\nHouse’s reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had\\nthought desperately, Not Slytherin ! and the hat had\\nsaid, Oh, well, if you’re sure ... better be Gryffindor. ...\\nAs they were shunted along in the throng, Colin\\nCreevey went past.\\n“Hiya, Harry!”\\n“Hullo, Colin,” said Harry automatically.\\n \\n“Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying\\nyou’re — ”\\nBut Colin was so small he couldn’t fight against the\\ntide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they\\nheard him squeak, “See you, Harry!” and he was\\ngone.\\n“What’s a boy in his class saying about you?”\\nHermione wondered.\\n“That I’m Slytherin’s heir, I expect,” said Harry, his\\nstomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly\\nremembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run\\naway from him at lunchtime.\\n“People here’ll believe anything,” said Ron in disgust.\\nThe crowd thinned and they were able to climb the\\nnext staircase without difficulty.\\n“D’you really think there’s a Chamber of Secrets?”\\nRon asked Hermione.\\n“I don’t know,” she said, frowning. “Dumbledore\\ncouldn’t cure Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think\\nthat whatever attacked her might not be — well —\\nhuman.”\\nAs she spoke, they turned a corner and found\\nthemselves at the end of the very corridor where the\\nattack had happened. They stopped and looked. The\\nscene was just as it had been that night, except that\\nthere was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket,\\nand an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the\\nmessage “The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened.”\\n“That’s where Filch has been keeping guard,” Ron\\nmuttered.\\n \\nThey looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.\\n“Can’t hurt to have a poke around,” said Harry,\\ndropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees\\nso that he could crawl along, searching for clues.\\n“Scorch marks!” he said. “Here — and here — ”\\n“Come and look at this!” said Hermione. “This is\\nfunny. ...”\\nHarry got up and crossed to the window next to the\\nmessage on the wall. Hermione was pointing at the\\ntopmost pane, where around twenty spiders were\\nscuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small\\ncrack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope,\\nas though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get\\noutside.\\n“Have you ever seen spiders act like that?” said\\nHermione wonderingly.\\n“No,” said Harry, “have you, Ron? Ron?”\\nHe looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well\\nback and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run.\\n“What’s up?” said Harry.\\n“I — don’t — like — spiders,” said Ron tensely.\\n“I never knew that,” said Hermione, looking at Ron in\\nsurprise. “You’ve used spiders in Potions loads of\\ntimes. ...”\\n“I don’t mind them dead,” said Ron, who was carefully\\nlooking anywhere but at the window. “I just don’t like\\nthe way they move. ...”\\n \\nHermione giggled.\\n“It’s not funny,” said Ron, fiercely. “If you must know,\\nwhen I was three, Fred turned my — my teddy bear\\ninto a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy\\nbroomstick. ... You wouldn’t like them either if you’d\\nbeen holding your bear and suddenly it had too many\\nlegs and ...”\\nHe broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously\\nstill trying not to laugh. Feeling they had better get off\\nthe subject, Harry said, “Remember all that water on\\nthe floor? Where did that come from? Someone’s\\nmopped it up.”\\n“It was about here,” said Ron, recovering himself to\\nwalk a few paces past Filch’s chair and pointing.\\n“Level with this door.”\\nHe reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly\\nwithdrew his hand as though he’d been burned.\\n“What’s the matter?” said Harry.\\n“Can’t go in there,” said Ron gruffly. “That’s a girls’\\ntoilet.”\\n“Oh, Ron, there won’t be anyone in there,” said\\nHermione, standing up and coming over. “That’s\\nMoaning Myrtle’s place. Come on, let’s have a look.”\\nAnd ignoring the large OUT OF ORDER sign, she\\nopened the door.\\nIt was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry\\nhad ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and\\nspotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. The floor\\nwas damp and reflected the dull light given off by the\\nstubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders;\\n \\nthe wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and\\nscratched and one of them was dangling off its\\nhinges.\\nHermione put her fingers to her lips and set off\\ntoward the end stall. When she reached it she said,\\n“Hello, Myrtle, how are you?”\\nHarry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was\\nfloating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on\\nher chin.\\n“This is a girls’ bathroom,” she said, eyeing Ron and\\nHarry suspiciously. “They’re not girls.”\\n“No,” Hermione agreed. “I just wanted to show them\\nhow — er — nice it is in here.”\\nShe waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the\\ndamp floor.\\n“Ask her if she saw anything,” Harry mouthed at\\nHermione.\\n“What are you whispering?” said Myrtle, staring at\\nhim.\\n“Nothing,” said Harry quickly. “We wanted to ask — ”\\n“I wish people would stop talking behind my back!”\\nsaid Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. “I do have\\nfeelings, you know, even if I am dead — ”\\n“Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,” said Hermione.\\n“Harry only — ”\\n“No one wants to upset me! That’s a good one!”\\nhowled Myrtle. “My life was nothing but misery at this\\nplace and now people come along ruining my death!”\\n \\n“We wanted to ask you if you’ve seen anything funny\\nlately,” said Hermione quickly. “Because a cat was\\nattacked right outside your front door on Halloween.”\\n“Did you see anyone near here that night?” said\\nHarry.\\n“I wasn’t paying attention,” said Myrtle dramatically.\\n“Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to\\nkill myself. Then, of course, I remembered that I’m —\\nthat I’m — ”\\n“Already dead,” said Ron helpfully.\\nMyrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned\\nover, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing\\nwater all over them and vanishing from sight,\\nalthough from the direction of her muffled sobs, she\\nhad come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.\\nHarry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but\\nHermione shrugged wearily and said, “Honestly, that\\nwas almost cheerful for Myrtle. ... Come on, let’s go.”\\nHarry had barely closed the door on Myrtle’s gurgling\\nsobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump.\\n“RON!”\\nPercy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the\\nstairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of\\ncomplete shock on his face.\\n“That’s a girls’ bathroom!” he gasped. “What were you\\n— ?”\\n“Just having a look around,” Ron shrugged. “Clues,\\nyou know — ”\\n \\nPercy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry\\nforcefully of Mrs. Weasley.\\n“Get — away — from — there — ” Percy said, striding\\ntoward them and starting to bustle them along,\\nflapping his arms. “Don’t you care what this looks\\nlike? Coming back here while everyone’s at dinner — ”\\n“Why shouldn’t we be here?” said Ron hotly, stopping\\nshort and glaring at Percy. “Listen, we never laid a\\nfinger on that cat!”\\n“That’s what I told Ginny,” said Percy fiercely, “but\\nshe still seems to think you’re going to be expelled,\\nI’ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you\\nmight think of her, all the first years are thoroughly\\noverexcited by this business — ”\\n“ You don’t care about Ginny,” said Ron, whose ears\\nwere now reddening. “You’re just worried I’m going to\\nmess up your chances of being Head Boy — ”\\n“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely,\\nfingering his prefect badge. “And I hope it teaches you\\na lesson! No more detective work, or I’ll write to\\nMum!”\\nAnd he strode off, the back of his neck as red as\\nRon’s ears.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as\\npossible from Percy in the common room that night.\\nRon was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting\\nhis Charms homework. When he reached absently for\\nhis wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the\\nparchment. Fuming almost as much as his\\nhomework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of\\n \\nSpells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry’s surprise, Hermione\\nfollowed suit.\\n“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as\\nthough continuing a conversation they had just been\\nhaving. “Who’d want to frighten all the Squibs and\\nMuggle-borns out of Hogwarts?”\\n“Let’s think,” said Ron in mock puzzlement. “Who do\\nwe know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?”\\nHe looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back,\\nunconvinced.\\n“If you’re talking about Malfoy — ”\\n“Of course I am!” said Ron. “You heard him — ‘You’ll\\nbe next, MudbloodsV — come on, you’ve only got to\\nlook at his foul rat face to know it’s him — ”\\n“Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?” said Hermione\\nskeptically.\\n“Look at his family,” said Harry, closing his books,\\ntoo. “The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin;\\nhe’s always boasting about it. They could easily be\\nSlytherin’s descendants. His father’s definitely evil\\nenough.”\\n“They could’ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets\\nfor centuries!” said Ron. “Handing it down, father to\\nson. ...”\\n“Well,” said Hermione cautiously, “I suppose it’s\\npossible. ...”\\n“But how do we prove it?” said Harry darkly.\\n \\n“There might be a way,” said Hermione slowly,\\ndropping her voice still further with a quick glance\\nacross the room at Percy. “Of course, it would be\\ndifficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We’d be\\nbreaking about fifty school rules, I expect — ”\\n“If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will\\nlet us know, won’t you?” said Ron irritably.\\n“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to\\ndo is to get inside the Slytherin common room and\\nask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it’s\\nus.”\\n“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.\\n“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be\\nsome Polyjuice Potion.”\\n“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.\\n“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — ”\\n“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions\\nthan listen to Snape?” muttered Ron.\\n“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it!\\nWe could change into three of the Slytherins. No one\\nwould know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us\\nanything. He’s probably boasting about it in the\\nSlytherin common room right now, if only we could\\nhear him.”\\n“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said\\nRon, frowning. “What if we were stuck looking like\\nthree of the Slytherins forever?”\\n“It wears off after a while,” said Hermione, waving her\\nhand impatiently. “But getting hold of the recipe will\\n \\nbe very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called\\nMoste Potente Potions and it’s bound to be in the\\nRestricted Section of the library.”\\nThere was only one way to get out a book from the\\nRestricted Section: You needed a signed note of\\npermission from a teacher.\\n“Hard to see why we’d want the book, really,” said\\nRon, “if we weren’t going to try and make one of the\\npotions.”\\n“I think,” said Hermione, “that if we made it sound as\\nthough we were just interested in the theory, we\\nmight stand a chance. ...”\\n“Oh, come on, no teacher’s going to fall for that,” said\\nRon. “They’d have to be really thick. ...”\\n \\n10\\nTHE ROGUE BLUDGER\\nSince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor\\nLockhart had not brought live creatures to class.\\nInstead, he read passages from his books to them,\\nand sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic\\nbits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these\\nreconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play\\na simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had\\ncured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold,\\nand a vampire who had been unable to eat anything\\nexcept lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.\\nHarry was hauled to the front of the class during their\\nvery next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this\\ntime acting a werewolf. If he hadn’t had a very good\\nreason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would\\nhave refused to do it.\\n“Nice loud howl, Harry — exactly — and then, if you’ll\\nbelieve it, I pounced — like this — slammed him to\\nthe floor — thus — with one hand, I managed to hold\\nhim down — with my other, I put my wand to his\\nthroat — I then screwed up my remaining strength\\n \\nand performed the immensely complex Homorphus\\nCharm — he let out a piteous moan — go on, Harry —\\nhigher than that — good — the fur vanished — the\\nfangs shrank — and he turned back into a man.\\nSimple, yet effective — and another village will\\nremember me forever as the hero who delivered them\\nfrom the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.”\\nThe bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.\\n“Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of\\nthe Wagga Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical\\nMe to the author of the best one!”\\nThe class began to leave. Harry returned to the back\\nof the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting.\\n“Ready?” Harry muttered.\\n“Wait till everyone’s gone,” said Hermione nervously.\\n“All right ...”\\nShe approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper\\nclutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right\\nbehind her.\\n“Er — Professor Lockhart?” Hermione stammered. “I\\nwanted to — to get this book out of the library. Just\\nfor background reading.” She held out the piece of\\npaper, her hand shaking slightly. “But the thing is,\\nit’s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a\\nteacher to sign for it — I’m sure it would help me\\nunderstand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls\\nabout slow-acting venoms — ”\\n“Ah, Gadding with GhoulsV’ said Lockhart, taking the\\nnote from Hermione and smiling widely at her.\\n“Possibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?”\\n \\n“Oh, yes,” said Hermione eagerly. “So clever, the way\\nyou trapped that last one with the tea-strainer — ”\\n“Well, I’m sure no one will mind me giving the best\\nstudent of the year a little extra help,” said Lockhart\\nwarmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock\\nquill. “Yes, nice, isn’t it?” he said, misreading the\\nrevolted look on Ron’s face. “I usually save it for book\\nsignings.”\\nHe scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note\\nand handed it back to Hermione.\\n“So, Harry,” said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the\\nnote with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag.\\n“Tomorrow’s the first Quidditch match of the season, I\\nbelieve? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear\\nyou’re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was\\nasked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to\\ndedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces.\\nStill, if ever you feel the need for a little private\\ntraining, don’t hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass\\non my expertise to less able players. ...”\\nHarry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then\\nhurried off after Ron and Hermione.\\n“I don’t believe it,” he said as the three of them\\nexamined the signature on the note. “He didn’t even\\nlook at the book we wanted.”\\n“That’s because he’s a brainless git,” said Ron. “But\\nwho cares, we’ve got what we needed — ”\\n“He is not a brainless git,” said Hermione shrilly as\\nthey half ran toward the library.\\n“Just because he said you were the best student of\\nthe year — ”\\n \\nThey dropped their voices as they entered the muffled\\nstillness of the library. Madam Pince, the librarian,\\nwas a thin, irritable woman who looked like an\\nunderfed vulture.\\n“Moste Potente Potions?” she repeated suspiciously,\\ntrying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione\\nwouldn’t let go.\\n“I was wondering if I could keep it,” she said\\nbreathlessly.\\n“Oh, come on,” said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp\\nand thrusting it at Madam Pince. “We’ll get you\\nanother autograph. Lockhart ’ll sign anything if it\\nstands still long enough.”\\nMadam Pince held the note up to the light, as though\\ndetermined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test.\\nShe stalked away between the lofty shelves and\\nreturned several minutes later carrying a large and\\nmoldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into\\nher bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or\\nlook too guilty.\\nFive minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning\\nMyrtle’s out-of-order bathroom once again. Hermione\\nhad overridden Ron’s objections by pointing out that\\nit was the last place anyone in their right minds\\nwould go, so they were guaranteed some privacy.\\nMoaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but\\nthey were ignoring her, and she them.\\nHermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and\\nthe three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages.\\nIt was clear from a glance why it belonged in the\\nRestricted Section. Some of the potions had effects\\nalmost too gruesome to think about, and there were\\nsome very unpleasant illustrations, which included a\\n \\nman who seemed to have been turned inside out and\\na witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of\\nher head.\\n“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the\\npage headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated\\nwith drawings of people halfway through transforming\\ninto other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist\\nhad imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces.\\n“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,”\\nsaid Hermione as they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing\\nflies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,” she\\nmurmured, running her finger down the list of\\ningredients. “Well, they’re easy enough, they’re in the\\nstudent store-cupboard, we can help ourselves. ...\\nOooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn — don’t know\\nwhere we’re going to get that — shredded skin of a\\nboomslang — thatll be tricky, too — and of course a\\nbit of whoever we want to change into.”\\n“Excuse me?” said Ron sharply. “What d’you mean, a\\nbit of whoever we’re changing into? I’m drinking\\nnothing with Crabbe’s toenails in it — ”\\nHermione continued as though she hadn’t heard him.\\n“We don’t have to worry about that yet, though,\\nbecause we add those bits last. ...”\\nRon turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another\\nworry.\\n“D’you realize how much we’re going to have to steal,\\nHermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that’s\\ndefinitely not in the students’ cupboard. What’re we\\ngoing to do, break into Snape’s private stores? I don’t\\nknow if this is a good idea. ...”\\n \\nHermione shut the book with a snap.\\n“Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,” she\\nsaid. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks\\nand her eyes were brighter than usual. “ I don’t want\\nto break rules, you know. / think threatening Muggle-\\nborns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion.\\nBut if you don’t want to find out if it’s Malfoy, I’ll go\\nstraight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back\\nin — ”\\n“I never thought I’d see the day when you’d be\\npersuading us to break rules,” said Ron. “All right,\\nwe’ll do it. But not toenails, okay?”\\n“How long will it take to make, anyway?” said Harry\\nas Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again.\\n“Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the\\nfull moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for\\ntwenty-one days ... I’d say it’d be ready in about a\\nmonth, if we can get all the ingredients.”\\n“A month?” said Ron. “Malfoy could have attacked\\nhalf the Muggle-borns in the school by then!” But\\nHermione ’s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he\\nadded swiftly, “But it’s the best plan we’ve got, so full\\nsteam ahead, I say.”\\nHowever, while Hermione was checking that the coast\\nwas clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron\\nmuttered to Harry, “It’ll be a lot less hassle if you can\\njust knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.”\\nHarry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a\\nwhile thinking about the coming Quidditch match. He\\nwas nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood\\nwould say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of\\nfacing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms\\n \\ngold could buy. He had never wanted to beat\\nSlytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there\\nwith his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and\\nwent down to breakfast early, where he found the rest\\nof the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty\\ntable, all looking uptight and not speaking much.\\nAs eleven o’clock approached, the whole school\\nstarted to make its way down to the Quidditch\\nstadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of\\nthunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying\\nover to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker\\nrooms. The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor\\nrobes, then sat down to listen to Wood’s usual pre-\\nmatch pep talk.\\n“Slytherin has better brooms than us,” he began. “No\\npoint denying it. But we’ve got better people on our\\nbrooms. We’ve trained harder than they have, we’ve\\nbeen flying in all weathers — ” (“Too true,” muttered\\nGeorge Weasley. “I haven’t been properly dry since\\nAugust”) “ — and we’re going to make them rue the\\nday they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his\\nway onto their team.”\\nChest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.\\n“It’ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a\\nSeeker has to have something more than a rich\\nfather. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying,\\nHarry, because we’ve got to win today, we’ve got to.”\\n“So no pressure, Harry,” said Fred, winking at him.\\nAs they walked out onto the field, a roar of noise\\ngreeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and\\nHufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but\\nthe Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and\\nhisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch\\n \\nteacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which\\nthey did, giving each other threatening stares and\\ngripping rather harder than was necessary.\\n“On my whistle,” said Madam Hooch. “Three ... two ...\\none ...”\\nWith a roar from the crowd to speed them upward,\\nthe fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky.\\nHarry flew higher than any of them, squinting around\\nfor the Snitch.\\n“All right there, Scarhead?” yelled Malfoy, shooting\\nunderneath him as though to show off the speed of\\nhis broom.\\nHarry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a\\nheavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he\\navoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as\\nit passed.\\n“Close one, Harry!” said George, streaking past him\\nwith his club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger\\nback toward a Slytherin. Harry saw George give the\\nBludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian\\nPucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair\\nand shot straight for Harry again.\\nHarry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George\\nmanaged to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once again, the\\nBludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry’s\\nhead.\\nHarry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the\\nother end of the field. He could hear the Bludger\\nwhistling along behind him. What was going on?\\nBludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it\\nwas their job to try and unseat as many people as\\npossible. ...\\n \\nFred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other\\nend. Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with\\nall his might; the Bludger was knocked off course.\\n“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as\\nthough it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the\\nBludger pelted after him once more and Harry was\\nforced to fly off at full speed.\\nIt had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto\\nhis face, splattering onto his glasses. He didn’t have a\\nclue what was going on in the rest of the game until\\nhe heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say,\\n“Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero — ”\\nThe Slytherins’ superior brooms were clearly doing\\ntheir jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing\\nall it could to knock Harry out of the air. Fred and\\nGeorge were now flying so close to him on either side\\nthat Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing\\narms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let\\nalone catch it.\\n“Someone’s — tampered — with — this — Bludger — ”\\nFred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it\\nas it launched a new attack on Harry.\\n“We need time out,” said George, trying to signal to\\nWood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry’s nose at\\nthe same time.\\nWood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch’s\\nwhistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived\\nfor the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger.\\n“What’s going on?” said Wood as the Gryffindor team\\nhuddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd\\njeered. “We’re being flattened. Fred, George, where\\n \\nwere you when that Bludger stopped Angelina\\nscoring?”\\n“We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other\\nBludger from murdering Harry, Oliver,” said George\\nangrily. “Someone’s fixed it — it won’t leave Harry\\nalone. It hasn’t gone for anyone else all game. The\\nSlytherins must have done something to it.”\\n“But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam\\nHooch’s office since our last practice, and there was\\nnothing wrong with them then. ...” said Wood,\\nanxiously.\\nMadam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her\\nshoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering\\nand pointing in his direction.\\n“Listen,” said Harry as she came nearer and nearer,\\n“with you two flying around me all the time the only\\nway I’m going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my\\nsleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal\\nwith the rogue one.”\\n“Don’t be thick,” said Fred. “It’ll take your head off.”\\nWood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.\\n“Oliver, this is insane,” said Alicia Spinnet angrily.\\n“You can’t let Harry deal with that thing on his own.\\nLet’s ask for an inquiry — ”\\n“If we stop now, we’ll have to forfeit the match!” said\\nHarry. “And we’re not losing to Slytherin just because\\nof a crazy Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave\\nme alone!”\\n \\n“This is all your fault,” George said angrily to Wood. “\\n‘Get the Snitch or die trying,’ what a stupid thing to\\ntell him—”\\nMadam Hooch had joined them.\\n“Ready to resume play?” she asked Wood.\\nWood looked at the determined look on Harry’s face.\\n“All right,” he said. “Fred, George, you heard Harry —\\nleave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on\\nhis own.”\\nThe rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam\\nHooch’s whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and\\nheard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him.\\nHigher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and\\nswooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly\\ndizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain\\nwas speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as\\nhe hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive\\nfrom the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the\\ncrowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the\\nrogue Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change\\ndirection as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind\\nof roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium,\\nsquinting through the silver sheets of rain to the\\nGryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying\\nto get past Wood —\\nA whistling in Harry’s ear told him the Bludger had\\njust missed him again; he turned right over and sped\\nin the opposite direction.\\n“Training for the ballet, Potter?” yelled Malfoy as\\nHarry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair\\nto dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing\\na few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at\\n \\nMalfoy in hatred, he saw it — the Golden Snitch. It\\nwas hovering inches above Malfoy’s left ear — and\\nMalfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn’t seen it.\\nFor an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not\\ndaring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up\\nand saw the Snitch.\\nWHAM.\\nHe had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger\\nhad hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and\\nHarry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by the searing\\npain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-\\ndrenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his\\nright arm dangling useless at his side — the Bludger\\ncame pelting back for a second attack, this time\\naiming at his face — Harry swerved out of the way,\\none idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to\\nMalfoy.\\nThrough a haze of rain and pain he dived for the\\nshimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes\\nwiden with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking\\nhim.\\n“What the — ” he gasped, careening out of Harry’s\\nway.\\nHarry took his remaining hand off his broom and\\nmade a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the\\ncold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with\\nhis legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as\\nhe headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to\\npass out.\\nWith a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off\\nhis broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange\\nangle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a\\n \\ndistance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He\\nfocused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.\\n“Aha,” he said vaguely. “We’ve won.”\\nAnd he fainted.\\nHe came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on\\nthe field, with someone leaning over him. He saw a\\nglitter of teeth.\\n“Oh, no, not you,” he moaned.\\n“Doesn’t know what he’s saying,” said Lockhart loudly\\nto the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around\\nthem. “Not to worry, Harry. I’m about to fix your\\narm.”\\n“iVo!” said Harry. “I’ll keep it like this, thanks. ...”\\nHe tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard\\na familiar clicking noise nearby.\\n“I don’t want a photo of this, Colin,” he said loudly.\\n“Lie back, Harry,” said Lockhart soothingly. “It’s a\\nsimple charm I’ve used countless times — ”\\n“Why can’t I just go to the hospital wing?” said Harry\\nthrough clenched teeth.\\n“He should really, Professor,” said a muddy Wood,\\nwho couldn’t help grinning even though his Seeker\\nwas injured. “Great capture, Harry, really\\nspectacular, your best yet, I’d say — ”\\nThrough the thicket of legs around him, Harry\\nspotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue\\n \\nBludger into a box. It was still putting up a terrific\\nfight.\\n“Stand back,” said Lockhart, who was rolling up his\\njade-green sleeves.\\n“No — don’t — ” said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was\\ntwirling his wand and a second later had directed it\\nstraight at Harry’s arm.\\nA strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry’s\\nshoulder and spread all the way down to his\\nfingertips. It felt as though his arm was being\\ndeflated. He didn’t dare look at what was happening.\\nHe had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his\\narm, but his worst fears were realized as the people\\nabove him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking\\naway madly. His arm didn’t hurt anymore — nor did\\nit feel remotely like an arm.\\n“Ah,” said Lockhart. “Yes. Well, that can sometimes\\nhappen. But the point is, the bones are no longer\\nbroken. That’s the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry,\\njust toddle up to the hospital wing — ah, Mr.\\nWeasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? — and\\nMadam Pomfrey will be able to — er — tidy you up a\\nbit.”\\nAs Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided.\\nTaking a deep breath he looked down at his right\\nside. What he saw nearly made him pass out again.\\nPoking out of the end of his robes was what looked\\nlike a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove. He tried to\\nmove his fingers. Nothing happened.\\nLockhart hadn’t mended Harry’s bones. He had\\nremoved them.\\n \\nMadam Pomfrey wasn’t at all pleased.\\n“You should have come straight to me!” she raged,\\nholding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an\\nhour before, had been a working arm. “I can mend\\nbones in a second — but growing them back — ”\\n“You will be able to, won’t you?” said Harry\\ndesperately.\\n“I’ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,” said\\nMadam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of\\npajamas. “You’ll have to stay the night. ...”\\nHermione waited outside the curtain drawn around\\nHarry’s bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas. It\\ntook a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a\\nsleeve.\\n“How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione,\\neh?” Ron called through the curtain as he pulled\\nHarry’s limp fingers through the cuff. “If Harry had\\nwanted deboning he would have asked.”\\n“Anyone can make a mistake,” said Hermione. “And it\\ndoesn’t hurt anymore, does it, Harry?”\\n“No,” said Harry, getting into bed. “But it doesn’t do\\nanything else either.”\\nAs he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped\\npointlessly.\\nHermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the\\ncurtain. Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of\\nsomething labeled Skele-Gro.\\n \\n“You’re in for a rough night,” she said, pouring out a\\nsteaming beakerful and handing it to him. “Regrowing\\nbones is a nasty business.”\\nSo was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry’s mouth\\nand throat as it went down, making him cough and\\nsplutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and\\ninept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron\\nand Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water.\\n“We won, though,” said Ron, a grin breaking across\\nhis face. “That was some catch you made. Malfoy’s\\nface ... he looked ready to kill. ...”\\n“I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,” said\\nHermione darkly.\\n“We can add that to the list of questions we’ll ask him\\nwhen we’ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,” said Harry,\\nsinking back onto his pillows. “I hope it tastes better\\nthan this stuff. ...”\\n“If it’s got bits of Slytherins in it? You’ve got to be\\njoking,” said Ron.\\nThe door of the hospital wing burst open at that\\nmoment. Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the\\nGryffindor team had arrived to see Harry.\\n“Unbelievable flying, Harry,” said George. “I’ve just\\nseen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about\\nhaving the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing.\\nMalfoy didn’t seem too happy.”\\nThey had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of\\npumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry’s bed and\\nwere just getting started on what promised to be a\\ngood party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over,\\n \\nshouting, “This boy needs rest, he’s got thirty- three\\nbones to regrow! Out! OUT!”\\nAnd Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him\\nfrom the stabbing pains in his limp arm.\\nHours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in\\nthe pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His\\narm now felt full of large splinters. For a second, he\\nthought that was what had woken him. Then, with a\\nthrill of horror, he realized that someone was\\nsponging his forehead in the dark.\\n“Get off!” he said loudly, and then, “Dobby\\\\”\\nThe house-elf’s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering\\nat Harry through the darkness. A single tear was\\nrunning down his long, pointed nose.\\n“Harry Potter came back to school,” he whispered\\nmiserably. “Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter.\\nAh sir, why didn’t you heed Dobby? Why didn’t Harry\\nPotter go back home when he missed the train?”\\nHarry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed\\nDobby’s sponge away.\\n“What’re you doing here?” he said. “And how did you\\nknow I missed the train?”\\nDobby’s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a\\nsudden suspicion.\\n“It was you!” he said slowly. “You stopped the barrier\\nfrom letting us through!”\\n“Indeed yes, sir,” said Dobby, nodding his head\\nvigorously, ears flapping. “Dobby hid and watched for\\nHarry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had\\n \\nto iron his hands afterward” — he showed Harry ten\\nlong, bandaged fingers — “but Dobby didn’t care, sir,\\nfor he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did\\nDobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school\\nanother way!”\\nHe was rocking backward and forward, shaking his\\nugly head.\\n“Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter\\nwas back at Hogwarts, he let his master’s dinner\\nburn! Such a flogging Dobby never had, sir. ...”\\nHarry slumped back onto his pillows.\\n“You nearly got Ron and me expelled,” he said\\nfiercely. “You’d better get lost before my bones come\\nback, Dobby, or I might strangle you.”\\nDobby smiled weakly.\\n“Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them\\nfive times a day at home.”\\nHe blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase\\nhe wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger\\nebb away in spite of himself.\\n“Why d’you wear that thing, Dobby?” he asked\\ncuriously.\\n“This, sir?” said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. “\\nTis a mark of the house-elf’s enslavement, sir. Dobby\\ncan only be freed if his masters present him with\\nclothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby\\neven a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave\\ntheir house forever.”\\n \\nDobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly,\\n“Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his\\nBludger would be enough to make — ”\\n“Your Bludger?” said Harry, anger rising once more.\\n“What d’you mean, your Bludger? You made that\\nBludger try and kill me?”\\n“Not kill you, sir, never kill you!” said Dobby,\\nshocked. “Dobby wants to save Harry Potter’s life!\\nBetter sent home, grievously injured, than remain\\nhere, sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt\\nenough to be sent home!”\\n“Oh, is that all?” said Harry angrily. “I don’t suppose\\nyou’re going to tell me why you wanted me sent home\\nin pieces?”\\n“Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!” Dobby groaned, more\\ntears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase. “If he knew\\nwhat he means to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we\\ndregs of the magical world! Dobby remembers how it\\nwas when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the\\nheight of his powers, sir! We house-elves were treated\\nlike vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like\\nthat, sir,” he admitted, drying his face on the\\npillowcase. “But mostly, sir, life has improved for my\\nkind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-\\nNamed. Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord’s\\npower was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and\\nHarry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of\\nus who thought the Dark days would never end, sir.\\n... And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to\\nhappen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby\\ncannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is\\nto repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is\\nopen once more — ”\\n \\nDobby froze, horrors truck, then grabbed Harry’s\\nwater jug from his bedside table and cracked it over\\nhis own head, toppling out of sight. A second later, he\\ncrawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering,\\n“Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby ...”\\n“So there is a Chamber of Secrets?” Harry whispered.\\n“And — did you say it’s been opened before ? Tell me,\\nDobby!”\\nHe seized the elf’s bony wrist as Dobby’s hand inched\\ntoward the water jug. “But I’m not Muggle-born —\\nhow can I be in danger from the Chamber?”\\n“Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,”\\nstammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. “Dark\\ndeeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter\\nmust not be here when they happen — go home,\\nHarry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle\\nin this, sir, ’tis too dangerous — ”\\n“Who is it, Dobby?” Harry said, keeping a firm hold on\\nDobby’s wrist to stop him from hitting himself with\\nthe water jug again. “Who’s opened it? Who opened it\\nlast time?”\\n“Dobby can’t, sir, Dobby can’t, Dobby mustn’t tell!”\\nsquealed the elf. “Go home, Harry Potter, go home!”\\n“I’m not going anywhere!” said Harry fiercely. “One of\\nmy best friends is Muggle-born; she’ll be first in line if\\nthe Chamber really has been opened — ”\\n“Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!”\\nmoaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy. “So\\nnoble! So valiant! But he must save himself, he must,\\nHarry Potter must not — ”\\n \\nDobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry\\nheard it, too. There were footsteps coming down the\\npassageway outside.\\n“Dobby must go!” breathed the elf, terrified. There\\nwas a loud crack, and Harry’s fist was suddenly\\nclenched on thin air. He slumped back into bed, his\\neyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the\\nfootsteps drew nearer.\\nNext moment, Dumbledore was backing into the\\ndormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a\\nnightcap. He was carrying one end of what looked like\\na statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second\\nlater, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a\\nbed.\\n“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered Dumbledore, and\\nProfessor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry’s\\nbed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be\\nasleep. He heard urgent voices, and then Professor\\nMcGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by\\nMadam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over\\nher nightdress. He heard a sharp intake of breath.\\n“What happened?” Madam Pomfrey whispered to\\nDumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed.\\n“Another attack,” said Dumbledore. “Minerva found\\nhim on the stairs.”\\n“There was a bunch of grapes next to him,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall. “We think he was trying to\\nsneak up here to visit Potter.”\\nHarry’s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and\\ncarefully, he raised himself a few inches so he could\\nlook at the statue on the bed. A ray of moonlight lay\\nacross its staring face.\\n \\nIt was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his\\nhands were stuck up in front of him, holding his\\ncamera.\\n“Petrified?” whispered Madam Pomfrey.\\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “But I shudder to\\nthink ... If Albus hadn’t been on the way downstairs\\nfor hot chocolate — who knows what might have — ”\\nThe three of them stared down at Colin. Then\\nDumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the\\ncamera out of Colin’s rigid grip.\\n“You don’t think he managed to get a picture of his\\nattacker?” said Professor McGonagall eagerly.\\nDumbledore didn’t answer. He opened the back of the\\ncamera.\\n“Good gracious!” said Madam Pomfrey.\\nA jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry,\\nthree beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt\\nplastic.\\n“Melted,” said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. “All\\nmelted ...”\\n“What does this mean, Albus?” Professor McGonagall\\nasked urgently.\\n“It means,” said Dumbledore, “that the Chamber of\\nSecrets is indeed open again.”\\nMadam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth.\\nProfessor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore.\\n“But, Albus ... surely ... who?”\\n \\n“The question is not who,” said Dumbledore, his eyes\\non Colin. “The question is, how. ...”\\nAnd from what Harry could see of Professor\\nMcGonagall’s shadowy face, she didn’t understand\\nthis any better than he did.\\n \\nTHE DUELING CLUB\\nHarry woke up on Sunday morning to find the\\ndormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm\\nreboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked\\nover at Colin’s bed, but it had been blocked from view\\nby the high curtains Harry had changed behind\\nyesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey\\ncame bustling over with a breakfast tray and then\\nbegan bending and stretching his arm and fingers.\\n“All in order,” she said as he clumsily fed himself\\nporridge left-handed. “When you’ve finished eating,\\nyou may leave.”\\nHarry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off\\nto Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and\\nHermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren’t\\nthere. Harry left to look for them, wondering where\\nthey could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that\\nthey weren’t interested in whether he had his bones\\nback or not.\\n \\nAs Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled\\nout of it, looking in far better spirits than last time\\nthey’d met.\\n“Oh, hello, Harry,” he said. “Excellent flying\\nyesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken\\nthe lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty points!”\\n“You haven’t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?” said\\nHarry.\\n“No, I haven’t,” said Percy, his smile fading. “I hope\\nRon’s not in another girls’ toilet ...”\\nHarry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight,\\nand then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle’s\\nbathroom. He couldn’t see why Ron and Hermione\\nwould be in there again, but after making sure that\\nneither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened\\nthe door and heard their voices coming from a locked\\nstall.\\n“It’s me,” he said, closing the door behind him. There\\nwas a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the\\nstall and he saw Hermione ’s eye peering through the\\nkeyhole.\\n“Harry\\\\” she said. “You gave us such a fright — come\\nin — how’s your arm?”\\n“Fine,” said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old\\ncauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling\\nfrom under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire\\nbeneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires\\nwas a speciality of Hermione ’s.\\n“We ’d’ve come to meet you, but we decided to get\\nstarted on the Polyjuice Potion,” Ron explained as\\n \\nHarry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. “We’ve\\ndecided this is the safest place to hide it.”\\nHarry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione\\ninterrupted.\\n“We already know — we heard Professor McGonagall\\ntelling Professor Flitwick this morning. That’s why we\\ndecided we’d better get going — ”\\n“The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the\\nbetter,” snarled Ron. “D’you know what I think? He\\nwas in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match,\\nhe took it out on Colin.”\\n“There’s something else,” said Harry, watching\\nHermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing\\nthem into the potion. “Dobby came to visit me in the\\nmiddle of the night.”\\nRon and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told\\nthem everything Dobby had told him — or hadn’t told\\nhim. Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths\\nopen.\\n“The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?”\\nHermione said.\\n“This settles it,” said Ron in a triumphant voice.\\n“Lucius Malfoy must’ve opened the Chamber when he\\nwas at school here and now he’s told dear old Draco\\nhow to do it. It’s obvious. Wish Dobby ’d told you what\\nkind of monster’s in there, though. I want to know\\nhow come nobody’s noticed it sneaking around the\\nschool.”\\n“Maybe it can make itself invisible,” said Hermione,\\nprodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. “Or\\nmaybe it can disguise itself — pretend to be a suit of\\n \\narmor or something — I’ve read about Chameleon\\nGhouls — ”\\n“You read too much, Hermione,” said Ron, pouring\\ndead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up\\nthe empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry.\\n“So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and\\nbroke your arm. ...” He shook his head. “You know\\nwhat, Harry? If he doesn’t stop trying to save your life\\nhe’s going to kill you.”\\nk k k\\nThe news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and\\nwas now lying as though dead in the hospital wing\\nhad spread through the entire school by Monday\\nmorning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and\\nsuspicion. The first years were now moving around\\nthe castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they\\nwould be attacked if they ventured forth alone.\\nGinny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in\\nCharms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and\\nGeorge were going the wrong way about cheering her\\nup. They were taking turns covering themselves with\\nfur or boils and jumping out at her from behind\\nstatues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic\\nwith rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs.\\nWeasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.\\nMeanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade\\nin talismans, amulets, and other protective devices\\nwas sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought\\na large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple\\ncrystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other\\nGryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger;\\n \\nhe was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be\\nattacked.\\n“They went for Filch first,” Neville said, his round face\\nfearful. “And everyone knows I’m almost a Squib.”\\nIn the second week of December Professor\\nMcGonagall came around as usual, collecting names\\nof those who would be staying at school for\\nChristmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list;\\nthey had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck\\nthem as very suspicious. The holidays would be the\\nperfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to\\nworm a confession out of him.\\nUnfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They\\nstill needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin,\\nand the only place they were going to get them was\\nfrom Snape’s private stores. Harry privately felt he’d\\nrather face Slytherin’s legendary monster than let\\nSnape catch him robbing his office.\\n“What we need,” said Hermione briskly as Thursday\\nafternoon’s double Potions lesson loomed nearer, “is a\\ndiversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape’s\\noffice and take what we need.”\\nHarry and Ron looked at her nervously.\\n“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione\\ncontinued in a matter-of-fact tone. “You two will be\\nexpelled if you get into any more trouble, and I’ve got\\na clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough\\nmayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.”\\nHarry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in\\nSnape’s Potions class was about as safe as poking a\\nsleeping dragon in the eye.\\n \\nPotions lessons took place in one of the large\\ndungeons. Thursday afternoon’s lesson proceeded in\\nthe usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming\\nbetween the wooden desks, on which stood brass\\nscales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through\\nthe fumes, making waspish remarks about the\\nGryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered\\nappreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape’s\\nfavorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron\\nand Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they\\nwould get detention faster than you could say\\n“Unfair.”\\nHarry’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he\\nhad his mind on more important things. He was\\nwaiting for Hermione’s signal, and he hardly listened\\nas Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion. When\\nSnape turned and walked off to bully Neville,\\nHermione caught Harry’s eye and nodded.\\nHarry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron,\\npulled one of Fred’s Filibuster fireworks out of his\\npocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The\\nfirework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had\\nonly seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and\\nlobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in\\nGoyle’s cauldron.\\nGoyle’s potion exploded, showering the whole class.\\nPeople shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution\\nhit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to\\nswell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his\\nhands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size\\nof a dinner plate — Snape was trying to restore calm\\nand find out what had happened. Through the\\nconfusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into\\nSnape’s office.\\n \\n“Silence! SILENCE!” Snape roared. “Anyone who has\\nbeen splashed, come here for a Deflating Draught —\\nwhen I find out who did this — ”\\nHarry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry\\nforward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose\\nlike a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to\\nSnape ’s desk, some weighted down with arms like\\nclubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed-\\nup lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the\\ndungeon, the front of her robes bulging.\\nWhen everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the\\nvarious swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to\\nGoyle’s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black\\nremains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.\\n“If I ever find out who threw this,” Snape whispered, “I\\nshall make sure that person is expelled.”\\nHarry arranged his face into what he hoped was a\\npuzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him,\\nand the bell that rang ten minutes later could not\\nhave been more welcome.\\n“He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as\\nthey hurried back to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. “I\\ncould tell.”\\nHermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron\\nand began to stir feverishly.\\n“It’ll be ready in two weeks,” she said happily.\\n“Snape can’t prove it was you,” said Ron reassuringly\\nto Harry. “What can he do?”\\n“Knowing Snape, something foul,” said Harry as the\\npotion frothed and bubbled.\\n \\nA week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking\\nacross the entrance hall when they saw a small knot\\nof people gathered around the notice board, reading a\\npiece of parchment that had just been pinned up.\\nSeamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them\\nover, looking excited.\\n“They’re starting a Dueling Club!” said Seamus. “First\\nmeeting tonight! I wouldn’t mind dueling lessons;\\nthey might come in handy one of these days. ...”\\n“What, you reckon Slytherin’s monster can duel?”\\nsaid Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest.\\n“Could be useful,” he said to Harry and Hermione as\\nthey went into dinner. “Shall we go?”\\nHarry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o’clock\\nthat evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The\\nlong dining tables had vanished and a golden stage\\nhad appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of\\ncandles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety\\nblack once more and most of the school seemed to be\\npacked beneath it, all carrying their wands and\\nlooking excited.\\n“I wonder who’ll be teaching us?” said Hermione as\\nthey edged into the chattering crowd. “Someone told\\nme Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was\\nyoung — maybe it’ll be him.”\\n“As long as it’s not — ” Harry began, but he ended on\\na groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the\\nstage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and\\naccompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his\\nusual black.\\n \\nLockhart waved an arm for silence and called,\\n“Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me?\\nCan you all hear me? Excellent!\\n“Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me\\npermission to start this little dueling club, to train\\nyou all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I\\nmyself have done on countless occasions — for full\\ndetails, see my published works.\\n“Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,”\\nsaid Lockhart, flashing a wide smile. “He tells me he\\nknows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has\\nsportingly agreed to help me with a short\\ndemonstration before we begin. Now, I don’t want any\\nof you youngsters to worry — you’ll still have your\\nPotions master when I’m through with him, never\\nfear!”\\n“Wouldn’t it be good if they finished each other off?”\\nRon muttered in Harry’s ear.\\nSnape ’s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why\\nLockhart was still smiling; if Snape had been looking\\nat him like that he’d have been running as fast as he\\ncould in the opposite direction.\\nLockhart and Snape turned to face each other and\\nbowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of\\nhis hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably.\\nThen they raised their wands like swords in front of\\nthem.\\n“As you see, we are holding our wands in the\\naccepted combative position,” Lockhart told the silent\\ncrowd. “On the count of three, we will cast our first\\nspells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.”\\n \\n“I wouldn’t bet on that,” Harry murmured, watching\\nSnape baring his teeth.\\n“One — two — three — ”\\nBoth of them swung their wands above their heads\\nand pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried:\\n“ ExpelliarmusV’ There was a dazzling flash of scarlet\\nlight and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew\\nbackward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and\\nslid down it to sprawl on the floor.\\nMalfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered.\\nHermione was dancing on tiptoes. “Do you think he’s\\nall right?” she squealed through her fingers.\\n“Who cares?” said Harry and Ron together.\\nLockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat\\nhad fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end.\\n“Well, there you have it!” he said, tottering back onto\\nthe platform. “That was a Disarming Charm — as you\\nsee, I’ve lost my wand — ah, thank you, Miss Brown\\n— yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor\\nSnape, but if you don’t mind my saying so, it was very\\nobvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to\\nstop you it would have been only too easy — however,\\nI felt it would be instructive to let them see ...”\\nSnape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had\\nnoticed, because he said, “Enough demonstrating! I’m\\ngoing to come amongst you now and put you all into\\npairs. Professor Snape, if you’d like to help me — ”\\nThey moved through the crowd, matching up\\npartners. Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-\\nFletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first.\\n \\n“Time to split up the dream team, I think,” he\\nsneered. “Weasley, you can partner Finnigan. Potter\\nHarry moved automatically toward Hermione.\\n“I don’t think so,” said Snape, smiling coldly. “Mr.\\nMalfoy, come over here. Let’s see what you make of\\nthe famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger — you can\\npartner Miss Bulstrode.”\\nMalfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a\\nSlytherin girl who reminded Harry of a picture he’d\\nseen in Holidays with Hags. She was large and square\\nand her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave\\nher a weak smile that she did not return.\\n“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the\\nplatform. “And bow!”\\nHarry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not\\ntaking their eyes off each other.\\n“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I\\ncount to three, cast your charms to disarm your\\nopponents — only to disarm them — we don’t want\\nany accidents — one . . . two . . . three — ”\\nHarry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already\\nstarted on “two”: His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as\\nthough he’d been hit over the head with a saucepan.\\nHe stumbled, but everything still seemed to be\\nworking, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his\\nwand straight at Malfoy and shouted, “Rictusempral”\\nA jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he\\ndoubled up, wheezing.\\n \\n“I said disarm only\\\\” Lockhart shouted in alarm over\\nthe heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his\\nknees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and\\nhe could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back,\\nwith a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch\\nMalfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a\\nmistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand\\nat Harry’s knees, choked, “Tarantallegral” and the\\nnext second Harry’s legs began to jerk around out of\\nhis control in a kind of quickstep.\\n“Stop! Stop!” screamed Lockhart, but Snape took\\ncharge.\\n“Finite Incantatem\\\\” he shouted; Harry’s feet stopped\\ndancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able\\nto look up.\\nA haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the\\nscene. Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor,\\npanting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus,\\napologizing for whatever his broken wand had done;\\nbut Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still\\nmoving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and\\nHermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands\\nlay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt forward and\\npulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot\\nbigger than he was.\\n“Dear, dear,” said Lockhart, skittering through the\\ncrowd, looking at the aftermath of the duels. “Up you\\ngo, Macmillan. ... Careful there, Miss Fawcett. ...\\nPinch it hard, it’ll stop bleeding in a second, Boot —\\n“I think I’d better teach you how to block unfriendly\\nspells,” said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst\\nof the hall. He glanced at Snape, whose black eyes\\nglinted, and looked quickly away. “Let’s have a\\n \\nvolunteer pair — Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley,\\nhow about you — ”\\n“A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,” said Snape, gliding\\nover like a large and malevolent bat. “Longbottom\\ncauses devastation with the simplest spells. We’ll be\\nsending what’s left of Finch-Fletchley up to the\\nhospital wing in a matchbox.” Neville’s round, pink\\nface went pinker. “How about Malfoy and Potter?”\\nsaid Snape with a twisted smile.\\n“Excellent idea!” said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and\\nMalfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed\\naway to give them room.\\n“Now, Harry,” said Lockhart. “When Draco points his\\nwand at you, you do this.”\\nHe raised his own wand, attempted a complicated\\nsort of wiggling action, and dropped it. Snape smirked\\nas Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, “Whoops —\\nmy wand is a little overexcited — ”\\nSnape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and\\nwhispered something in his ear. Malfoy smirked, too.\\nHarry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said,\\n“Professor, could you show me that blocking thing\\nagain?”\\n“Scared?” muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn’t\\nhear him.\\n“You wish,” said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.\\nLockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. “Just\\ndo what I did, Harry!”\\n“What, drop my wand?”\\n \\nBut Lockhart wasn’t listening.\\n“Three — two — one — go!” he shouted.\\nMalfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed,\\n“ Serpensortial”\\nThe end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast,\\nas a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto\\nthe floor between them, and raised itself, ready to\\nstrike. There were screams as the crowd backed\\nswiftly away, clearing the floor.\\n“Don’t move, Potter,” said Snape lazily, clearly\\nenjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye\\nto eye with the angry snake. “I’ll get rid of it. ...”\\n“Allow me!” shouted Lockhart. He brandished his\\nwand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the\\nsnake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air\\nand fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged,\\nhissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin\\nFinch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed,\\npoised to strike.\\nHarry wasn’t sure what made him do it. He wasn’t\\neven aware of deciding to do it. All he knew was that\\nhis legs were carrying him forward as though he was\\non casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the\\nsnake, “Leave him alone!” And miraculously —\\ninexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor, docile\\nas a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry.\\nHarry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the\\nsnake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how he\\nknew it, he couldn’t have explained.\\nHe looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see\\nJustin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful —\\nbut certainly not angry and scared.\\n \\n“What do you think you’re playing at?” he shouted,\\nand before Harry could say anything, Justin had\\nturned and stormed out of the hall.\\nSnape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the\\nsnake vanished in a small puff of black smoke.\\nSnape, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected\\nway: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry\\ndidn’t like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous\\nmuttering all around the walls. Then he felt a tugging\\non the back of his robes.\\n“Come on,” said Ron’s voice in his ear. “Move — come\\non—”\\nRon steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying\\nalongside them. As they went through the doors, the\\npeople on either side drew away as though they were\\nfrightened of catching something. Harry didn’t have a\\nclue what was going on, and neither Ron nor\\nHermione explained anything until they had dragged\\nhim all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common\\nroom. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and\\nsaid, “You’re a Parselmouth. Why didn’t you tell us?”\\n“I’m a what?” said Harry.\\n“A Parselmouth .!” said Ron. “You can talk to snakes!”\\n“I know,” said Harry. “I mean, that’s only the second\\ntime I’ve ever done it. I accidentally set a boa\\nconstrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once —\\nlong story — but it was telling me it had never seen\\nBrazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to —\\nthat was before I knew I was a wizard — ”\\n“A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?”\\nRon repeated faintly.\\n \\n“So?” said Harry. “I bet loads of people here can do it.”\\n“Oh, no they can’t,” said Ron. “It’s not a very common\\ngift. Harry, this is bad.”\\n“What’s bad?” said Harry, starting to feel quite angry.\\n“What’s wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn’t told\\nthat snake not to attack Justin — ”\\n“Oh, that’s what you said to it?”\\n“What d’you mean? You were there — you heard me\\n“I heard you speaking Parseltongue,” said Ron.\\n“Snake language. You could have been saying\\nanything — no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded\\nlike you were egging the snake on or something — it\\nwas creepy, you know — ”\\nHarry gaped at him.\\n“I spoke a different language? But — I didn’t realize —\\nhow can I speak a language without knowing I can\\nspeak it?”\\nRon shook his head. Both he and Hermione were\\nlooking as though someone had died. Harry couldn’t\\nsee what was so terrible.\\n“D’you want to tell me what’s wrong with stopping a\\nmassive snake biting off Justin’s head?” he said.\\n“What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin\\ndoesn’t have to join the Headless Hunt?”\\n“It matters,” said Hermione, speaking at last in a\\nhushed voice, “because being able to talk to snakes\\nwas what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That’s\\nwhy the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.”\\n \\nHarry’s mouth fell open.\\n“Exactly,” said Ron. “And now the whole school’s\\ngoing to think you’re his great-great-great-great-\\ngrandson or something — ”\\n“But I’m not,” said Harry, with a panic he couldn’t\\nquite explain.\\n“You’ll find that hard to prove,” said Hermione. “He\\nlived about a thousand years ago; for all we know,\\nyou could be.”\\n•k k k\\nHarry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap\\nin the curtains around his four-poster he watched\\nsnow starting to drift past the tower window and\\nwondered ...\\nCould he be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin? He\\ndidn’t know anything about his father’s family, after\\nall. The Dursleys had always forbidden questions\\nabout his wizarding relatives.\\nQuietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue.\\nThe words wouldn’t come. It seemed he had to be\\nface-to-face with a snake to do it.\\nBut I’m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat\\nwouldn’t have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood.\\nAh, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the\\nSorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don’t you\\nremember?\\nHarry turned over. He’d see Justin the next day in\\nHerbology and he’d explain that he’d been calling the\\n \\nsnake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily,\\npummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.\\nBy next morning, however, the snow that had begun\\nin the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that\\nthe last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled:\\nProfessor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on\\nthe Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust\\nto no one else, now that it was so important for the\\nMandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and\\nColin Creevey.\\nHarry fretted about this next to the fire in the\\nGryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione\\nused their time off to play a game of wizard chess.\\n“For heaven’s sake, Harry,” said Hermione,\\nexasperated, as one of Ron’s bishops wrestled her\\nknight off his horse and dragged him off the board.\\n“Go and find Justin if it’s so important to you.”\\nSo Harry got up and left through the portrait hole,\\nwondering where Justin might be.\\nThe castle was darker than it usually was in daytime\\nbecause of the thick, swirling gray snow at every\\nwindow. Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms\\nwhere lessons were taking place, catching snatches of\\nwhat was happening within. Professor McGonagall\\nwas shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had\\nturned his friend into a badger. Resisting the urge to\\ntake a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin\\nmight be using his free time to catch up on some\\nwork, and deciding to check the library first.\\nA group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in\\nHerbology were indeed sitting at the back of the\\nlibrary, but they didn’t seem to be working. Between\\nthe long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see\\n \\nthat their heads were close together and they were\\nhaving what looked like an absorbing conversation.\\nHe couldn’t see whether Justin was among them. He\\nwas walking toward them when something of what\\nthey were saying met his ears, and he paused to\\nlisten, hidden in the Invisibility section.\\n“So anyway,” a stout boy was saying, “I told Justin to\\nhide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter’s\\nmarked him down as his next victim, it’s best if he\\nkeeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin’s\\nbeen waiting for something like this to happen ever\\nsince he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. Justin\\nactually told him he’d been down for Eton. That’s not\\nthe kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin’s\\nheir on the loose, is it?”\\n“You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?” said a\\ngirl with blonde pigtails anxiously.\\n“Hannah,” said the stout boy solemnly, “he’s a\\nParselmouth. Everyone knows that’s the mark of a\\nDark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one\\nwho could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin\\nhimself Serpent-tongue.”\\nThere was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie\\nwent on, “Remember what was written on the wall?\\nEnemies of the Heir, Beware. Potter had some sort of\\nrun-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch ’s cat’s\\nattacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying\\nPotter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him\\nwhile he was lying in the mud. Next thing we know —\\nCreevey ’s been attacked.”\\n“He always seems so nice, though,” said Hannah\\nuncertainly, “and, well, he’s the one who made You-\\nKnow-Who disappear. He can’t be all bad, can he?”\\n \\nErnie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs\\nbent closer, and Harry edged nearer so that he could\\ncatch Ernie’s words.\\n“No one knows how he survived that attack by You-\\nKnow-Who. I mean to say, he was only a baby when it\\nhappened. He should have been blasted into\\nsmithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard\\ncould have survived a curse like that.” He dropped his\\nvoice until it was barely more than a whisper, and\\nsaid, “ That’s probably why You-Know-Who wanted to\\nkill him in the first place. Didn’t want another Dark\\nLord competing with him. I wonder what other powers\\nPotter’s been hiding?”\\nHarry couldn’t take anymore. Clearing his throat\\nloudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves.\\nIf he hadn’t been feeling so angry, he would have\\nfound the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of\\nthe Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been\\nPetrified by the sight of him, and the color was\\ndraining out of Ernie’s face.\\n“Hello,” said Harry. “I’m looking for Justin Finch-\\nFletchley.”\\nThe Hufflepuffs’ worst fears had clearly been\\nconfirmed. They all looked fearfully at Ernie.\\n“What do you want with him?” said Ernie in a\\nquavering voice.\\n“I wanted to tell him what really happened with that\\nsnake at the Dueling Club,” said Harry.\\nErnie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep\\nbreath, said, “We were all there. We saw what\\nhappened.”\\n \\n“Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake\\nbacked off?” said Harry.\\n“All I saw,” said Ernie stubbornly, though he was\\ntrembling as he spoke, “was you speaking\\nParseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.”\\n“I didn’t chase it at him!” Harry said, his voice\\nshaking with anger. “It didn’t even touch him!”\\n“It was a very near miss,” said Ernie. “And in case\\nyou’re getting ideas,” he added hastily, “I might tell\\nyou that you can trace my family back through nine\\ngenerations of witches and warlocks and my blood’s\\nas pure as anyone’s, so — ”\\n“I don’t care what sort of blood you’ve got!” said Harry\\nfiercely. “Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?”\\n“I’ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,” said\\nErnie swiftly.\\n“It’s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not\\nhate them,” said Harry. “I’d like to see you try it.”\\nHe turned on his heel and stormed out of the library,\\nearning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince,\\nwho was polishing the gilded cover of a large\\nspellbook.\\nHarry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing\\nwhere he was going, he was in such a fury. The result\\nwas that he walked into something very large and\\nsolid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.\\n“Oh, hello, Hagrid,” Harry said, looking up.\\nHagrid’s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-\\ncovered balaclava, but it couldn’t possibly be anyone\\n \\nelse, as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin\\novercoat. A dead rooster was hanging from one of his\\nmassive, gloved hands.\\n“All righ’, Harry?” he said, pulling up the balaclava so\\nhe could speak. “Why aren’t yeh in class?”\\n“Canceled,” said Harry, getting up. “What’re you doing\\nin here?”\\nHagrid held up the limp rooster.\\n“Second one killed this term,” he explained. “It’s\\neither foxes or a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, an’ I need\\nthe headmaster’s permission ter put a charm around\\nthe hen coop.”\\nHe peered more closely at Harry from under his thick,\\nsnow-flecked eyebrows.\\n“Yeh sure yeh’re all righ’? Yeh look all hot an’\\nbothered — ”\\nHarry couldn’t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and\\nthe rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him.\\n“It’s nothing,” he said. “I’d better get going, Hagrid, it’s\\nTransfiguration next and I’ve got to pick up my\\nbooks.”\\nHe walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had\\nsaid about him.\\n“Justin’s been waiting for something like this to\\nhappen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-\\nborn. ...”\\nHarry stamped up the stairs and turned along\\nanother corridor, which was particularly dark; the\\n \\ntorches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft\\nthat was blowing through a loose windowpane. He\\nwas halfway down the passage when he tripped\\nheadlong over something lying on the floor.\\nHe turned to squint at what he’d fallen over and felt\\nas though his stomach had dissolved.\\nJustin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid\\nand cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes\\nstaring blankly at the ceiling. And that wasn’t all.\\nNext to him was another figure, the strangest sight\\nHarry had ever seen.\\nIt was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white\\nand transparent, but black and smoky, floating\\nimmobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. His\\nhead was half off and his face wore an expression of\\nshock identical to Justin’s.\\nHarry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow,\\nhis heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs. He\\nlooked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and\\nsaw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could\\naway from the bodies. The only sounds were the\\nmuffled voices of teachers from the classes on either\\nside.\\nHe could run, and no one would ever know he had\\nbeen there. But he couldn’t just leave them lying\\nhere. ... He had to get help. ... Would anyone believe\\nhe hadn’t had anything to do with this?\\nAs he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him\\nopened with a bang. Peeves the Poltergeist came\\nshooting out.\\n \\n“Why, it’s potty wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, knocking\\nHarry’s glasses askew as he bounced past him.\\n“What’s Potter up to? Why’s Potter lurking — ”\\nPeeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault.\\nUpside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless\\nNick. He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and,\\nbefore Harry could stop him, screamed, “ATTACK!\\nATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR\\nGHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!\\nATTAAAACK!”\\nCrash — crash — crash — door after door flew open\\nalong the corridor and people flooded out. For several\\nlong minutes, there was a scene of such confusion\\nthat Justin was in danger of being squashed and\\npeople kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry\\nfound himself pinned against the wall as the teachers\\nshouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came\\nrunning, followed by her own class, one of whom still\\nhad black-and-white- striped hair. She used her wand\\nto set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and\\nordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner\\nhad the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the\\nHufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.\\n“ Caught in the act!” Ernie yelled, his face stark white,\\npointing his finger dramatically at Harry.\\n“That will do, Macmillan!” said Professor McGonagall\\nsharply.\\nPeeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly,\\nsurveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As\\nthe teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless\\nNick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:\\n“Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,\\n \\nYou’re killing off students, you think it’s good fun — ”\\n“That’s enough, Peeves!” barked Professor\\nMcGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with\\nhis tongue out at Harry.\\nJustin was carried up to the hospital wing by\\nProfessor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the\\nAstronomy department, but nobody seemed to know\\nwhat to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end,\\nProfessor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin\\nair, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft\\nNearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did,\\nfanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This\\nleft Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.\\n“This way, Potter,” she said.\\n“Professor,” said Harry at once, “I swear I didn’t — ”\\n“This is out of my hands, Potter,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall curtly.\\nThey marched in silence around a corner and she\\nstopped before a large and extremely ugly stone\\ngargoyle.\\n“Lemon drop!” she said. This was evidently a\\npassword, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to\\nlife and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in\\ntwo. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry\\ncouldn’t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a\\nspiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward,\\nlike an escalator. As he and Professor McGonagall\\nstepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed\\nbehind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and\\nhigher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a\\ngleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the\\nshape of a griffin.\\n \\nHe knew now where he was being taken. This must be\\nwhere Dumbledore lived.\\n \\nTHE POLY JUICE POTION\\nThey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and\\nProfessor McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened\\nsilently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told\\nHarry to wait and left him there, alone.\\nHarry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the\\nteachers’ offices Harry had visited so far this year,\\nDumbledore’s was by far the most interesting. If he\\nhadn’t been scared out of his wits that he was about\\nto be thrown out of school, he would have been very\\npleased to have a chance to look around it.\\nIt was a large and beautiful circular room, full of\\nfunny little noises. A number of curious silver\\ninstruments stood on spindle-legged tables, whirring\\nand emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were\\ncovered with portraits of old headmasters and\\nheadmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in\\ntheir frames. There was also an enormous, claw-\\nfooted desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a\\nshabby, tattered wizard’s hat — the Sorting Hat\\n \\nHarry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the\\nsleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it\\ncouldn’t hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on\\nagain? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him\\nin the right House —\\nHe walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from\\nits shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was\\nmuch too large and slipped down over his eyes, just\\nas it had done the last time he’d put it on. Harry\\nstared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a\\nsmall voice said in his ear, “Bee in your bonnet, Harry\\nPotter?”\\n“Er, yes,” Harry muttered. “Er — sorry to bother you\\n— I wanted to ask — ”\\n“You’ve been wondering whether I put you in the right\\nHouse,” said the hat smartly. “Yes ... you were\\nparticularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I\\nsaid before” — Harry’s heart leapt — “you would have\\ndone well in Slytherin — ”\\nHarry’s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of\\nthe hat and pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand,\\ngrubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its\\nshelf, feeling sick.\\n“You’re wrong,” he said aloud to the still and silent\\nhat. It didn’t move. Harry backed away, watching it.\\nThen a strange, gagging noise behind him made him\\nwheel around.\\nHe wasn’t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch\\nbehind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that\\nresembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it\\nand the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging\\nnoise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes\\n \\nwere dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more\\nfeathers fell out of its tail.\\nHarry was just thinking that all he needed was for\\nDumbledore ’s pet bird to die while he was alone in\\nthe office with it, when the bird burst into flames.\\nHarry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk.\\nHe looked feverishly around in case there was a glass\\nof water somewhere but couldn’t see one; the bird,\\nmeanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud\\nshriek and next second there was nothing but a\\nsmoldering pile of ash on the floor.\\nThe office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking\\nvery somber.\\n“Professor,” Harry gasped. “Your bird — I couldn’t do\\nanything — he just caught fire — ”\\nTo Harry’s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.\\n“About time, too,” he said. “He’s been looking dreadful\\nfor days; I’ve been telling him to get a move on.”\\nHe chuckled at the stunned look on Harry’s face.\\n“Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into\\nflame when it is time for them to die and are reborn\\nfrom the ashes. Watch him ...”\\nHarry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled,\\nnewborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. It was\\nquite as ugly as the old one.\\n“It’s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,”\\nsaid Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk.\\n“He’s really very handsome most of the time,\\nwonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating\\n \\ncreatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely\\nheavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and\\nthey make highly faithful pets.”\\nIn the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had\\nforgotten what he was there for, but it all came back\\nto him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high\\nchair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his\\npenetrating, light-blue stare.\\nBefore Dumbledore could speak another word,\\nhowever, the door of the office flew open with an\\nalmighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his\\neyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black\\nhead and the dead rooster still swinging from his\\nhand.\\n“It wasn’ Harry, Professor Dumbledore!” said Hagrid\\nurgently. “I was talkin’ ter him seconds before that\\nkid was found, he never had time, sir — ”\\nDumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went\\nranting on, waving the rooster around in his\\nagitation, sending feathers everywhere.\\n“ — it can’t’ve bin him, I’ll swear it in front o’ the\\nMinistry o’ Magic if I have to — ”\\n“Hagrid, I — ”\\n“ — yeh’ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never\\n“Hagridl” said Dumbledore loudly. “I do not think that\\nHarry attacked those people.”\\n“Oh,” said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his\\nside. “Right. I’ll wait outside then, Headmaster.”\\n \\nAnd he stomped out looking embarrassed.\\n“You don’t think it was me, Professor?” Harry\\nrepeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster\\nfeathers off his desk.\\n“No, Harry, I don’t,” said Dumbledore, though his face\\nwas somber again. “But I still want to talk to you.”\\nHarry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered\\nhim, the tips of his long fingers together.\\n“I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything\\nyou’d like to tell me,” he said gently. “Anything at all.”\\nHarry didn’t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy\\nshouting, “You’ll be next, Mudbloods!” and of the\\nPolyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle’s\\nbathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice\\nhe had heard twice and remembered what Ron had\\nsaid: “ Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good\\nsign, even in the wizarding world.” He thought, too,\\nabout what everyone was saying about him, and his\\ngrowing dread that he was somehow connected with\\nSalazar Slytherin. ...\\n“No,” said Harry. “There isn’t anything, Professor. ...”\\nThe double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless\\nNick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into\\nreal panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick’s\\nfate that seemed to worry people most. What could\\npossibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other;\\nwhat terrible power could harm someone who was\\nalready dead? There was almost a stampede to book\\nseats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could\\ngo home for Christmas.\\n \\n“At this rate, well be the only ones left,” Ron told\\nHarry and Hermione. “Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle.\\nWhat a jolly holiday it’s going to be.”\\nCrabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy\\ndid, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But\\nHarry was glad that most people were leaving. He was\\ntired of people skirting around him in the corridors,\\nas though he were about to sprout fangs or spit\\npoison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and\\nhissing as he passed.\\nFred and George, however, found all this very funny.\\nThey went out of their way to march ahead of Harry\\ndown the corridors, shouting, “Make way for the Heir\\nof Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through. ...”\\nPercy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.\\n“It is not a laughing matter,” he said coldly.\\n“Oh, get out of the way, Percy,” said Fred. “Harry’s in\\na hurry.”\\n“Yeah, he’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of\\ntea with his fanged servant,” said George, chortling.\\nGinny didn’t find it amusing either.\\n“Oh, don’t,” she wailed every time Fred asked Harry\\nloudly who he was planning to attack next, or when\\nGeorge pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove\\nof garlic when they met.\\nHarry didn’t mind; it made him feel better that Fred\\nand George, at least, thought the idea of his being\\nSlytherin ’s heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics\\nseemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked\\nincreasingly sour each time he saw them at it.\\n \\n“It’s because he’s bursting to say it’s really him,” said\\nRon knowingly. “You know how he hates anyone\\nbeating him at anything, and you’re getting all the\\ncredit for his dirty work.”\\n“Not for long,” said Hermione in a satisfied tone. “The\\nPolyjuice Potion’s nearly ready. We’ll be getting the\\ntruth out of him any day now.”\\nAt last the term ended, and a silence deep as the\\nsnow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry\\nfound it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed\\nthe fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the\\nrun of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play\\nExploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and\\npractice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny\\nhad chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in\\nEgypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who\\ndisapproved of what he termed their childish\\nbehavior, didn’t spend much time in the Gryffindor\\ncommon room. He had already told them pompously\\nthat he was only staying over Christmas because it\\nwas his duty as a prefect to support the teachers\\nduring this troubled time.\\nChristmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry\\nand Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were\\nwoken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully\\ndressed and carrying presents for them both.\\n“Wake up,” she said loudly, pulling back the curtains\\nat the window.\\n“Hermione — you’re not supposed to be in here — ”\\nsaid Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.\\n“Merry Christmas to you, too,” said Hermione,\\nthrowing him his present. “I’ve been up for nearly an\\n \\nhour, adding more lace-wings to the potion. It’s\\nready.”\\nHarry sat up, suddenly wide awake.\\n“Are you sure?”\\n“Positive,” said Hermione, shirting Scabbers the rat so\\nthat she could sit down on the end of Ron’s four-\\nposter. “If we’re going to do it, I say it should be\\ntonight.”\\nAt that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room,\\ncarrying a very small package in her beak.\\n“Hello,” said Harry happily as she landed on his bed.\\n“Are you speaking to me again?”\\nShe nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way,\\nwhich was a far better present than the one that she\\nhad brought him, which turned out to be from the\\nDursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note\\ntelling him to find out whether he’d be able to stay at\\nHogwarts for the summer vacation, too.\\nThe rest of Harry’s Christmas presents were far more\\nsatisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle\\ntoffee, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before\\neating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with\\nthe Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his\\nfavorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought\\nhim a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the\\nlast present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from\\nMrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card\\nwith a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr.\\nWeasley’s car (which hadn’t been seen since its crash\\nwith the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-\\nbreaking he and Ron were planning next.\\n \\nNo one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice\\nPotion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at\\nHogwarts.\\nThe Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were\\nthere a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick\\nstreamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the\\nceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and\\ndry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of\\nhis favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more\\nloudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed.\\nPercy, who hadn’t noticed that Fred had bewitched\\nhis prefect badge so that it now read “Pin-head,” kept\\nasking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry\\ndidn’t even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud,\\nsnide remarks about his new sweater from the\\nSlytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be\\ngetting his comeuppance in a few hours’ time.\\nHarry and Ron had barely finished their third\\nhelpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione\\nushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for\\nthe evening.\\n“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing\\ninto,” said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she\\nwere sending them to the supermarket for laundry\\ndetergent. “And obviously, it’ll be best if you can get\\nsomething of Crabbe’s and Goyle’s; they’re Malfoy’s\\nbest friends, he’ll tell them anything. And we also\\nneed to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can’t\\nburst in on us while we’re interrogating him.\\n“I’ve got it all worked out,” she went on smoothly,\\nignoring Harry’s and Ron’s stupefied faces. She held\\nup two plump chocolate cakes. “I’ve filled these with a\\nsimple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make\\nsure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how\\ngreedy they are, they’re bound to eat them. Once\\n \\nthey’re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide\\nthem in a broom closet.”\\nHarry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.\\n“Hermione, I don’t think — ”\\n“That could go seriously wrong — ”\\nBut Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike\\nthe one Professor McGonagall sometimes had.\\n“The potion will be useless without Crabbe’s and\\nGoyle’s hair,” she said sternly. “You do want to\\ninvestigate Malfoy, don’t you?”\\n“Oh, all right, all right,” said Harry. “But what about\\nyou? Whose hair are you ripping out?”\\n“I’ve already got mine!” said Hermione brightly,\\npulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing\\nthem the single hair inside it. “Remember Millicent\\nBulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She\\nleft this on my robes when she was trying to strangle\\nme! And she’s gone home for Christmas — so I’ll just\\nhave to tell the Slytherins I’ve decided to come back.”\\nWhen Hermione had bustled off to check on the\\nPolyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a\\ndoom-laden expression.\\n“Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things\\ncould go wrong?”\\nBut to Harry’s and Ron’s utter amazement, stage one\\nof the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione\\nhad said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall\\nafter Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle\\nwho had remained alone at the Slytherin table,\\n \\nshoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had\\nperched the chocolate cakes on the end of the\\nbanisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle\\ncoming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid\\nquickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.\\n“How thick can you get?” Ron whispered ecstatically\\nas Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle\\nand grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the\\ncakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment,\\nboth of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on\\ntheir faces. Then, without the smallest change of\\nexpression, they both keeled over backward onto the\\nfloor.\\nBy far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet\\nacross the hall. Once they were safely stowed among\\nthe buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of\\nthe bristles that covered Goyle ’s forehead and Ron\\npulled out several of Crabbe ’s hairs. They also stole\\ntheir shoes, because their own were far too small for\\nCrabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at\\nwhat they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning\\nMyrtle’s bathroom.\\nThey could hardly see for the thick black smoke\\nissuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring\\nthe cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces,\\nHarry and Ron knocked softly on the door.\\n“Hermione?”\\nThey heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione\\nemerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious. Behind\\nher they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling,\\nglutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on\\nthe toilet seat.\\n“Did you get them?” Hermione asked breathlessly.\\n \\nHarry showed her Goyle’s hair.\\n“Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the\\nlaundry,” Hermione said, holding up a small sack.\\n“You’ll need bigger sizes once you’re Crabbe and\\nGoyle.”\\nThe three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up,\\nthe potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling\\nsluggishly.\\n“I’m sure I’ve done everything right,” said Hermione,\\nnervously rereading the splotched page of Moste\\nPotente Potions. “It looks like the book says it should\\n... once we’ve drunk it, we’ll have exactly an hour\\nbefore we change back into ourselves.”\\n“Now what?” Ron whispered.\\n“We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.”\\nHermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each\\nof the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook\\nMillicent Bulstrode’s hair out of its bottle into the first\\nglass.\\nThe potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and\\nfrothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick\\nsort of yellow.\\n“Urgh — essence of Millicent Bulstrode,” said Ron,\\neyeing it with loathing. “Bet it tastes disgusting.”\\n“Add yours, then,” said Hermione.\\nHarry dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and\\nRon put Crabbe’s into the last one. Both glasses\\nhissed and frothed: Goyle’s turned the khaki color of\\na booger, Crabbe’s a dark, murky brown.\\n \\n“Hang on,” said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached\\nfor their glasses. “We’d better not all drink them in\\nhere. ... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won’t\\nfit. And Millicent Bulstrode’s no pixie.”\\n“Good thinking,” said Ron, unlocking the door. “We’ll\\ntake separate stalls.”\\nCareful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion,\\nHarry slipped into the middle stall.\\n“Ready?” he called.\\n“Ready,” came Ron’s and Hermione’s voices.\\n“One — two — three — ”\\nPinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in\\ntwo large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage.\\nImmediately, his insides started writhing as though\\nhe’d just swallowed live snakes — doubled up, he\\nwondered whether he was going to be sick — then a\\nburning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to\\nthe very ends of his fingers and toes — next, bringing\\nhim gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting\\nfeeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot\\nwax — and before his eyes, his hands began to grow,\\nthe fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the\\nknuckles were bulging like bolts — his shoulders\\nstretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead\\ntold him that hair was creeping down toward his\\neyebrows — his robes ripped as his chest expanded\\nlike a barrel bursting its hoops — his feet were agony\\nin shoes four sizes too small —\\nAs suddenly as it had started, everything stopped.\\nHarry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening\\nto Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With\\n \\ndifficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So\\nthis was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand\\ntrembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were\\nhanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare\\nones, and laced up Goyle’s boatlike shoes. He reached\\nup to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the\\nshort growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead.\\nThen he realized that his glasses were clouding his\\neyes because Goyle obviously didn’t need them — he\\ntook them off and called, “Are you two okay?” Goyle’s\\nlow rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.\\n“Yeah,” came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.\\nHarry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the\\ncracked mirror. Goyle stared back at him out of dull,\\ndeepset eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle.\\nRon’s door opened. They stared at each other. Except\\nthat he looked pale and shocked, Ron was\\nindistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-\\nbowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.\\n“This is unbelievable,” said Ron, approaching the\\nmirror and prodding Crabbe ’s flat nose.\\n“Unbelievable.”\\n“We’d better get going,” said Harry, loosening the\\nwatch that was cutting into Goyle’s thick wrist. “We’ve\\nstill got to find out where the Slytherin common room\\nis. I only hope we can find someone to follow ...”\\nRon, who had been gazing at Harry, said, “You don’t\\nknow how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.” He\\nbanged on Hermione’s door. “C’mon, we need to go — ”\\nA high-pitched voice answered him.\\n \\n“I — I don’t think I’m going to come after all. You go\\non without me.”\\n“Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode’s ugly, no\\none’s going to know it’s you — ”\\n“No — really — I don’t think I’ll come. You two hurry\\nup, you’re wasting time — ”\\nHarry looked at Ron, bewildered.\\n“That looks more like Goyle,” said Ron. “That’s how he\\nlooks every time a teacher asks him a question.”\\n“Hermione, are you okay?” said Harry through the\\ndoor.\\n“Fine — I’m fine — go on — ”\\nHarry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty\\nminutes had already passed.\\n“Well meet you back here, all right?” he said.\\nHarry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom\\ncarefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set\\noff.\\n“Don’t swing your arms like that,” Harry muttered to\\nRon.\\n“Eh?”\\n“Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. ...”\\n“How’s this?”\\n“Yeah, that’s better. ...”\\n \\nThey went down the marble staircase. All they needed\\nnow was a Slytherin that they could follow to the\\nSlytherin common room, but there was nobody\\naround.\\n“Any ideas?” muttered Harry.\\n“The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from\\nover there,” said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the\\ndungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when\\na girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance.\\n“Excuse me,” said Ron, hurrying up to her. “We’ve\\nforgotten the way to our common room.”\\n“I beg your pardon?” said the girl stiffly. “Our common\\nroom? I’m a Ravenclaw.”\\nShe walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.\\nHarry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the\\ndarkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly\\nas Crabbe’s and Goyle’s huge feet hit the floor, feeling\\nthat this wasn’t going to be as easy as they had\\nhoped.\\nThe labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked\\ndeeper and deeper under the school, constantly\\nchecking their watches to see how much time they\\nhad left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they\\nwere getting desperate, they heard a sudden\\nmovement ahead.\\n“Ha!” said Ron excitedly. “There’s one of them now!”\\nThe figure was emerging from a side room. As they\\nhurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn’t a\\nSlytherin, it was Percy.\\n \\n“What’re you doing down here?” said Ron in surprise.\\nPercy looked affronted.\\n“That,” he said stiffly, “is none of your business. It’s\\nCrabbe, isn’t it?”\\n“Wh — oh, yeah,” said Ron.\\n“Well, get off to your dormitories,” said Percy sternly.\\n“It’s not safe to go wandering around dark corridors\\nthese days.”\\n“You are,” Ron pointed out.\\n“I,” said Percy, drawing himself up, “am a prefect.\\nNothing’s about to attack me.”\\nA voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron.\\nDraco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the\\nfirst time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him.\\n“There you are,” he drawled, looking at them. “Have\\nyou two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this\\ntime? I’ve been looking for you; I want to show you\\nsomething really funny.”\\nMalfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.\\n“And what’re you doing down here, Weasley?” he\\nsneered.\\nPercy looked outraged.\\n“You want to show a bit more respect to a school\\nprefect!” he said. “I don’t like your attitude!”\\nMalfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to\\nfollow him. Harry almost said something apologetic to\\n \\nPercy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron\\nhurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the\\nnext passage, “That Peter Weasley — ”\\n“Percy,” Ron corrected him automatically.\\n“Whatever,” said Malfoy. “I’ve noticed him sneaking\\naround a lot lately. And I bet I know what he’s up to.\\nHe thinks he’s going to catch Slytherin’s heir single-\\nhanded.”\\nHe gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron\\nexchanged excited looks.\\nMalfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.\\n“What’s the new password again?” he said to Harry.\\n“Er — ” said Harry.\\n“Oh, yeah — pure-blood\\\\” said Malfoy, not listening,\\nand a stone door concealed in the wall slid open.\\nMalfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron\\nfollowed him.\\nThe Slytherin common room was a long, low\\nunderground room with rough stone walls and ceiling\\nfrom which round, greenish lamps were hanging on\\nchains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately\\ncarved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several\\nSlytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed\\nchairs.\\n“Wait here,” said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning\\nthem to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire.\\n“I’ll go and get it — my father’s just sent it to me — ”\\n \\nWondering what Malfoy was going to show them,\\nHarry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at\\nhome.\\nMalfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked\\nlike a newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron’s\\nnose.\\n“That’ll give you a laugh,” he said.\\nHarry saw Ron\\'s eyes widen in shock. He read the\\nclipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and\\nhanded it to Harry.\\nIt had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it\\nsaid:\\nINQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\\nArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle\\nArtifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for\\nbewitching a Muggle car.\\nMr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of\\nWitchcraft and Wizardry, where the enchanted car\\ncrashed earlier this year, called today for Mr.\\nWeasley’s resignation.\\n“Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,”\\nMr. Malfoy told our reporter. “He is clearly unfit to\\ndraw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle\\nProtection Act should be scrapped immediately.”\\nMr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although\\nhis wife told reporters to clear off or she’d set the\\nfamily ghoul on them.\\n \\n“Well?” said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the\\nclipping back to him. “Don’t you think it’s funny?”\\n“Ha, ha,” said Harry bleakly.\\n“Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should\\nsnap his wand in half and go and join them,” said\\nMalfoy scornfully. “You’d never know the Weasleys\\nwere purebloods, the way they behave.”\\nRon’s — or rather, Crabbe’s — face was contorted\\nwith fury.\\n“What’s up with you, Crabbe?” snapped Malfoy.\\n“Stomachache,” Ron grunted.\\n“Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those\\nMudbloods a kick from me,” said Malfoy, snickering.\\n“You know, I’m surprised the Daily Prophet hasn’t\\nreported all these attacks yet,” he went on\\nthoughtfully. “I suppose Dumbledore’s trying to hush\\nit all up. He’ll be sacked if it doesn’t stop soon.\\nFather’s always said old Dumbledore’s the worst thing\\nthat’s ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-\\nborns. A decent headmaster would never ’ve let slime\\nlike that Creevey in.”\\nMalfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary\\ncamera and did a cruel but accurate impression of\\nColin: “ ‘Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I\\nhave your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please,\\nPotter?’ ”\\nHe dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.\\n“What’s the matter with you two?”\\n \\nFar too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to\\nlaugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe\\nand Goyle were always slow on the uptake.\\n“Saint Potter, the Mudbloods’ friend,” said Malfoy\\nslowly. “He’s another one with no proper wizard\\nfeeling, or he wouldn’t go around with that jumped-up\\nGranger Mudblood. And people think he’s Slytherin’s\\nheir!”\\nHarry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was\\nsurely seconds away from telling them it was him —\\nbut then —\\n“I wish I knew who it is,” said Malfoy petulantly. “I\\ncould help them.”\\nRon’s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more\\nclueless than usual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn’t notice,\\nand Harry, thinking fast, said, “You must have some\\nidea who’s behind it all. ...”\\n“You know I haven’t, Goyle, how many times do I have\\nto tell you?” snapped Malfoy. “And Father won’t tell\\nme anything about the last time the Chamber was\\nopened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it\\nwas before his time, but he knows all about it, and he\\nsays that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious\\nif I know too much about it. But I know one thing —\\nlast time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a\\nMudblood died. So I bet it’s a matter of time before\\none of them’s killed this time. ... I hope it’s Granger,”\\nhe said with relish.\\nRon was clenching Crabbe ’s gigantic fists. Feeling\\nthat it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched\\nMalfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said,\\n“D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber\\nlast time was caught?”\\n \\n“Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,” said\\nMalfoy. “They’re probably still in Azkaban.”\\n“Azkaban?” said Harry, puzzled.\\n“Azkaban — the wizard prison , Goyle,” said Malfoy,\\nlooking at him in disbelief. “Honestly, if you were any\\nslower, you’d be going backward.”\\nHe shifted restlessly in his chair and said, “Father\\nsays to keep my head down and let the Heir of\\nSlytherin get on with it. He says the school needs\\nridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed\\nup in it. Of course, he’s got a lot on his plate at the\\nmoment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our\\nmanor last week?”\\nHarry tried to force Goyle ’s dull face into a look of\\nconcern.\\n“Yeah ...” said Malfoy. “Luckily, they didn’t find much.\\nFather’s got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But\\nluckily, we’ve got our own secret chamber under the\\ndrawing-room floor — ”\\n“Ho!” said Ron.\\nMalfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed.\\nEven his hair was turning red. His nose was also\\nslowly lengthening — their hour was up, Ron was\\nturning back into himself, and from the look of horror\\nhe was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.\\nThey both jumped to their feet.\\n“Medicine for my stomach,” Ron grunted, and without\\nfurther ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin\\ncommon room, hurled themselves at the stone wall,\\nand dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that\\n \\nMalfoy hadn’t noticed anything. Harry could feel his\\nfeet slipping around in Goyle’s huge shoes and had to\\nhoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the\\nsteps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a\\nmuffled pounding coming from the closet where\\nthey’d locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes\\noutside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks\\nup the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle’s\\nbathroom.\\n“Well, it wasn’t a complete waste of time,” Ron\\npanted, closing the bathroom door behind them. “I\\nknow we still haven’t found out who’s doing the\\nattacks, but I’m going to write to Dad tomorrow and\\ntell him to check under the Malfoys’ drawing room.”\\nHarry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was\\nback to normal. He put his glasses on as Ron\\nhammered on the door of Hermione’s stall.\\n“Hermione, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you — ”\\n“Go away!” Hermione squeaked.\\nHarry and Ron looked at each other.\\n“What’s the matter?” said Ron. “You must be back to\\nnormal by now, we are — ”\\nBut Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall\\ndoor. Harry had never seen her looking so happy.\\n“Ooooooh, wait till you see,” she said. “It’s awful — ”\\nThey heard the lock slide back and Hermione\\nemerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head.\\n“What’s up?” said Ron uncertainly. “Have you still got\\nMillicent’s nose or something?”\\n \\nHermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the\\nsink.\\nHer face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had\\nturned yellow and there were long, pointed ears\\npoking through her hair.\\n“It was a c-cat hair!” she howled. “M-Millicent\\nBulstrode m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn’t\\nsupposed to be used for animal transformations!”\\n“Uh-oh,” said Ron.\\n“You’ll be teased something dreadful,” said Myrtle\\nhappily.\\n“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take\\nyou up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never\\nasks too many questions. ...”\\nIt took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the\\nbathroom. Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way\\nwith a hearty guffaw. “Wait till everyone finds out\\nyou’ve got a tail\\\\”\\n \\n* V\\nTHE VERY SECRET DIARY\\nHermione remained in the hospital wing for several\\nweeks. There was a flurry of rumor about her\\ndisappearance when the rest of the school arrived\\nback from their Christmas holidays, because of\\ncourse everyone thought that she had been attacked.\\nSo many students filed past the hospital wing trying\\nto catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took\\nout her curtains again and placed them around\\nHermione’s bed, to spare her the shame of being seen\\nwith a furry face.\\nHarry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When\\nthe new term started, they brought her each day’s\\nhomework.\\n“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,”\\nsaid Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione’s\\nbedside table one evening.\\n“Don’t be silly, Ron, I’ve got to keep up,” said\\nHermione briskly. Her spirits were greatly improved\\nby the fact that all the hair had gone from her face\\n \\nand her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. “I\\ndon’t suppose you’ve got any new leads?” she added\\nin a whisper, so that Madam Pomfrey couldn’t hear\\nher.\\n“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily.\\n“I was so sure it was Malfoy,” said Ron, for about the\\nhundredth time.\\n“What’s that?” asked Harry, pointing to something\\ngold sticking out from under Hermione’s pillow.\\n“Just a get well card,” said Hermione hastily, trying to\\npoke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He\\npulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud:\\n“To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from\\nyour concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart,\\nOrder of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the\\nDark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of\\nWitch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award.”\\nRon looked up at Hermione, disgusted.\\n“You sleep with this under your pillow?”\\nBut Hermione was spared answering by Madam\\nPomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of\\nmedicine.\\n“Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you’ve ever met, or\\nwhat?” Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary\\nand started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower.\\nSnape had given them so much homework, Harry\\nthought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he\\nfinished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had\\nasked Hermione how many rat tails you were\\nsupposed to add to a Hair-Raising Potion when an\\n \\nangry outburst from the floor above reached their\\nears.\\n“That’s Filch,” Harry muttered as they hurried up the\\nstairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard.\\n“You don’t think someone else’s been attacked?” said\\nRon tensely.\\nThey stood still, their heads inclined toward Filch’s\\nvoice, which sounded quite hysterical.\\n“ — even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I\\nhaven’t got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I’m\\ngoing to Dumbledore — ”\\nHis footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor\\nand they heard a distant door slam.\\nThey poked their heads around the corner. Filch had\\nclearly been manning his usual lookout post: They\\nwere once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had\\nbeen attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had\\nbeen shouting about. A great flood of water stretched\\nover half the corridor, and it looked as though it was\\nstill seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle’s\\nbathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they\\ncould hear Myrtle’s wails echoing off the bathroom\\nwalls.\\n“Now what’s up with her?” said Ron.\\n“Let’s go and see,” said Harry, and holding their robes\\nover their ankles they stepped through the great wash\\nof water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign,\\nignored it as always, and entered.\\nMoaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and\\nharder than ever before. She seemed to be hiding\\n \\ndown her usual toilet. It was dark in the bathroom\\nbecause the candles had been extinguished in the\\ngreat rush of water that had left both walls and floor\\nsoaking wet.\\n“What’s up, Myrtle?” said Harry.\\n“Who’s that?” glugged Myrtle miserably. “Come to\\nthrow something else at me?”\\nHarry waded across to her stall and said, “Why would\\nI throw something at you?”\\n“Don’t ask me,” Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave\\nof yet more water, which splashed onto the already\\nsopping floor. “Here I am, minding my own business,\\nand someone thinks it’s funny to throw a book at me.\\n“But it can’t hurt you if someone throws something at\\nyou,” said Harry, reasonably. “I mean, it’d just go\\nright through you, wouldn’t it?”\\nHe had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up\\nand shrieked, “Let’s all throw books at Myrtle,\\nbecause she can’t feel it! Ten points if you can get it\\nthrough her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through\\nher head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don’t\\nthink!”\\n“Who threw it at you, anyway?” asked Harry.\\n“I don’t know. ... I was just sitting in the U-bend,\\nthinking about death, and it fell right through the top\\nof my head,” said Myrtle, glaring at them. “It’s over\\nthere, it got washed out. ...”\\nHarry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle\\nwas pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a\\n \\nshabby black cover and was as wet as everything else\\nin the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up,\\nbut Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.\\n“What?” said Harry.\\n“Are you cra2y?” said Ron. “It could be dangerous.”\\n“ Dangerous ?” said Harry, laughing. “Come off it, how\\ncould it be dangerous?”\\n“You’d be surprised,” said Ron, who was looking\\napprehensively at the book. “Some of the books the\\nMinistry’s confiscated — Dad’s told me — there was\\none that burned your eyes out. And everyone who\\nread Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the\\nrest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a\\nbook that you could never stop reading ! You just had\\nto wander around with your nose in it, trying to do\\neverything one-handed. And — ”\\n“All right, I’ve got the point,” said Harry.\\nThe little book lay on the floor, nondescript and\\nsoggy.\\n“Well, we won’t find out unless we look at it,” he said,\\nand he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the\\nfloor.\\nHarry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded\\nyear on the cover told him it was fifty years old. He\\nopened it eagerly. On the first page he could just\\nmake out the name “T. M. Riddle” in smudged ink.\\n“Hang on,” said Ron, who had approached cautiously\\nand was looking over Harry’s shoulder. “I know that\\nname. ... T. M. Riddle got an award for special\\nservices to the school fifty years ago.”\\n \\n“How on earth d’you know that?” said Harry in\\namazement.\\n“Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty\\ntimes in detention,” said Ron resentfully. “That was\\nthe one I burped slugs all over. If you’d wiped slime\\noff a name for an hour, you’d remember it, too.”\\nHarry peeled the wet pages apart. They were\\ncompletely blank. There wasn’t the faintest trace of\\nwriting on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel’s\\nbirthday, or dentist, half-past three.\\n“He never wrote in it,” said Harry, disappointed.\\n“I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?” said\\nRon curiously.\\nHarry turned to the back cover of the book and saw\\nthe printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road,\\nLondon.\\n“He must’ve been Muggle-born,” said Harry\\nthoughtfully. “To have bought a diary from Vauxhall\\nRoad. ...”\\n“Well, it’s not much use to you,” said Ron. He\\ndropped his voice. “Fifty points if you can get it\\nthrough Myrtle’s nose.”\\nHarry, however, pocketed it.\\nHermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-\\nless, and fur-free, at the beginning of February. On\\nher first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry\\nshowed her T. M. Riddle’s diary and told her the story\\nof how they had found it.\\n \\n“Oooh, it might have hidden powers,” said Hermione\\nenthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it\\nclosely.\\n“If it has, it’s hiding them very well,” said Ron. “Maybe\\nit’s shy. I don’t know why you don’t chuck it, Harry.”\\n“I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,” said\\nHarry. “I wouldn’t mind knowing how Riddle got an\\naward for special services to Hogwarts either.”\\n“Could’ve been anything,” said Ron. “Maybe he got\\nthirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant\\nsquid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would’ve done\\neveryone a favor. ...”\\nBut Harry could tell from the arrested look on\\nHermione ’s face that she was thinking what he was\\nthinking.\\n“What?” said Ron, looking from one to the other.\\n“Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years\\nago, wasn’t it?” he said. “That’s what Malfoy said.”\\n“Yeah ...” said Ron slowly.\\n“And this diary is fifty years old,” said Hermione,\\ntapping it excitedly.\\n“So?”\\n“Oh, Ron, wake up,” snapped Hermione. “We know\\nthe person who opened the Chamber last time was\\nexpelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an\\naward for special services to the school fifty years\\nago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for\\ncatching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would\\nprobably tell us everything — where the Chamber is,\\n \\nand how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in\\nit — the person who’s behind the attacks this time\\nwouldn’t want that lying around, would they?”\\n“That’s a brilliant theory, Hermione,” said Ron, “with\\njust one tiny little flaw. There’s nothing written in his\\ndiary.”\\nBut Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.\\n“It might be invisible ink!” she whispered.\\nShe tapped the diary three times and said,\\n“Aparecium\\\\”\\nNothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her\\nhand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared\\nto be a bright red eraser.\\n“It’s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,” she said.\\nShe rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.\\n“I’m telling you, there’s nothing to find in there,” said\\nRon. “Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and\\ncouldn’t be bothered filling it in.”\\nHarry couldn’t explain, even to himself, why he didn’t\\njust throw Riddle’s diary away. The fact was that even\\nthough he knew the diary was blank, he kept\\nabsentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages,\\nas though it were a story he wanted to finish. And\\nwhile Harry was sure he had never heard the name T.\\nM. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to\\nhim, almost as though Riddle was a friend he’d had\\nwhen he was very small, and had half-forgotten. But\\nthis was absurd. He’d never had friends before\\nHogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.\\n \\nNevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more\\nabout Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the\\ntrophy room to examine Riddle’s special award,\\naccompanied by an interested Hermione and a\\nthoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he’d\\nseen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime.\\nRiddle’s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a\\ncorner cabinet. It didn’t carry details of why it had\\nbeen given to him (“Good thing, too, or it’d be even\\nbigger and I’d still be polishing it,” said Ron).\\nHowever, they did find Riddle’s name on an old Medal\\nfor Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys.\\n“He sounds like Percy,” said Ron, wrinkling his nose\\nin disgust. “Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every\\nclass — ”\\n“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” said Hermione in a\\nslightly hurt voice.\\nThe sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts\\nagain. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more\\nhopeful. There had been no more attacks since those\\non Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam\\nPomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes\\nwere becoming moody and secretive, meaning that\\nthey were fast leaving childhood.\\n“The moment their acne clears up, they’ll be ready for\\nrepotting again,” Harry heard her telling Filch kindly\\none afternoon. “And after that, it won’t be long until\\nwe’re cutting them up and stewing them. You’ll have\\nMrs. Norris back in no time.”\\nPerhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her\\nnerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and\\nriskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the\\nschool so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster,\\n \\nwhatever it was, was even now settling itself down to\\nhibernate for another fifty years. ...\\nErnie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn’t take this cheerful\\nview. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty\\none, that he had “given himself away” at the Dueling\\nClub. Peeves wasn’t helping matters; he kept popping\\nup in the crowded corridors singing “Oh, Potter, you\\nrotter ...” now with a dance routine to match.\\nGilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had\\nmade the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling\\nProfessor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were\\nlining up for Transfiguration.\\n“I don’t think there’ll be any more trouble, Minerva,”\\nhe said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. “I\\nthink the Chamber has been locked for good this\\ntime. The culprit must have known it was only a\\nmatter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to\\nstop now, before I came down hard on him.\\n“You know, what the school needs now is a morale-\\nbooster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won’t\\nsay any more just now, but I think I know just the\\nthing. ...”\\nHe tapped his nose again and strode off.\\nLockhart’s idea of a morale-booster became clear at\\nbreakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn’t\\nhad much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch\\npractice the night before, and he hurried down to the\\nGreat Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment,\\nthat he’d walked through the wrong doors.\\nThe walls were all covered with large, lurid pink\\nflowers. Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling\\nfrom the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the\\n \\nGryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking\\nsickened, and Hermione seemed to have been\\novercome with giggles.\\n“What’s going on?” Harry asked them, sitting down\\nand wiping confetti off his bacon.\\nRon pointed to the teachers’ table, apparently too\\ndisgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink\\nrobes to match the decorations, was waving for\\nsilence. The teachers on either side of him were\\nlooking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could\\nsee a muscle going in Professor McGonagall’s cheek.\\nSnape looked as though someone had just fed him a\\nlarge beaker of Skele-Gro.\\n“Happy Valentine’s Day!” Lockhart shouted. “And may\\nI thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me\\ncards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this\\nlittle surprise for you all — and it doesn’t end here!”\\nLockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to\\nthe entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking\\ndwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had\\nthem all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.\\n“My friendly, card-carrying cupids!” beamed Lockhart.\\n“They will be roving around the school today\\ndelivering your valentines! And the fun doesn’t stop\\nhere! I’m sure my colleagues will want to enter into\\nthe spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor\\nSnape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And\\nwhile you’re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more\\nabout Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I’ve\\never met, the sly old dog!”\\nProfessor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape\\nwas looking as though the first person to ask him for\\na Love Potion would be force-fed poison.\\n \\n“Please, Hermione, tell me you weren’t one of the\\nforty-six,” said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their\\nfirst lesson. Hermione suddenly became very\\ninterested in searching her bag for her schedule and\\ndidn’t answer.\\nAll day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their\\nclasses to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the\\nteachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors\\nwere walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs\\ncaught up with Harry.\\n“Oy, you! ’Arry Potter!” shouted a particularly grim-\\nlooking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to\\nHarry.\\nHot all over at the thought of being given a valentine\\nin front of a line of first years, which happened to\\ninclude Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The\\ndwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by\\nkicking people’s shins, and reached him before he’d\\ngone two paces.\\n“I’ve got a musical message to deliver to ’Arry Potter in\\nperson,” he said, twanging his harp in a threatening\\nsort of way.\\n“Not here,” Harry hissed, trying to escape.\\n“Stay stilll” grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of\\nHarry’s bag and pulling him back.\\n“Let me go!” Harry snarled, tugging.\\nWith a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His\\nbooks, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the\\nfloor and his ink bottle smashed over everything.\\n \\nHarry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up\\nbefore the dwarf started singing, causing something of\\na holdup in the corridor.\\n“What’s going on here?” came the cold, drawling voice\\nof Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything\\nfeverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away\\nbefore Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.\\n“What’s all this commotion?” said another familiar\\nvoice as Percy Weasley arrived.\\nLosing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but\\nthe dwarf seized him around the knees and brought\\nhim crashing to the floor.\\n“Right,” he said, sitting on Harry’s ankles. “Here is\\nyour singing valentine:\\nHis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,\\nHis hair is as dark as a blackboard.\\nI wish he was mine, he’s really divine,\\nThe hero who conquered the Dark Lord.”\\nHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to\\nevaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along\\nwith everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the\\nweight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to\\ndisperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with\\nmirth.\\n“Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago,\\noff to class, now,” he said, shooing some of the\\nyounger students away. “And you, Malfoy — ”\\n \\nHarry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up\\nsomething. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and\\nGoyle, and Harry realized that he’d got Riddle’s diary.\\n“Give that back,” said Harry quietly.\\n“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” said Malfoy,\\nwho obviously hadn’t noticed the year on the cover\\nand thought he had Harry’s own diary. A hush fell\\nover the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary\\nto Harry, looking terrified.\\n“Hand it over, Malfoy,” said Percy sternly.\\n“When I’ve had a look,” said Malfoy, waving the diary\\ntauntingly at Harry.\\nPercy said, “As a school prefect — ” but Harry had lost\\nhis temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted,\\n“ ExpelliarmusV’ and just as Snape had disarmed\\nLockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of\\nhis hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught\\nit.\\n“Harry!” said Percy loudly. “No magic in the corridors.\\nI’ll have to report this, you know!”\\nBut Harry didn’t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and\\nthat was worth five points from Gryffindor any day.\\nMalfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him\\nto enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her,\\n“I don’t think Potter liked your valentine much!”\\nGinny covered her face with her hands and ran into\\nclass. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but\\nHarry pulled him away. Ron didn’t need to spend the\\nwhole of Charms belching slugs.\\n \\nIt wasn’t until they had reached Professor Flitwick’s\\nclass that Harry noticed something rather odd about\\nRiddle’s diary. All his other books were drenched in\\nscarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had\\nbeen before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He\\ntried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having\\ntrouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles\\nwere blossoming out of the end, and he wasn’t much\\ninterested in anything else.\\nJc Jc Jc\\nHarry went to bed before anyone else in his\\ndormitory that night. This was partly because he\\ndidn’t think he could stand Fred and George singing,\\n“His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad” one\\nmore time, and partly because he wanted to examine\\nRiddle’s diary again, and knew that Ron thought he\\nwas wasting his time.\\nHarry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the\\nblank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet\\nink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his\\nbedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped\\na blot onto the first page of the diary.\\nThe ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and\\nthen, as though it was being sucked into the page,\\nvanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second\\ntime and wrote, “My name is Harry Potter.”\\nThe words shone momentarily on the page and they,\\ntoo, sank without trace. Then, at last, something\\nhappened.\\nOozing back out of the page, in his very own ink,\\ncame words Harry had never written.\\n \\n“Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did\\nyou come by my diary?”\\nThese words, too, faded away, but not before Harry\\nhad started to scribble back.\\n“Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.”\\nHe waited eagerly for Riddle’s reply.\\n“Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more\\nlasting way than ink. But I always knew that there\\nwould be those who would not want this diary read.”\\n“What do you mean?” Harry scrawled, blotting the\\npage in his excitement.\\n“I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible\\nthings. Things that were covered up. Things that\\nhappened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\\nWizardry.”\\n“That’s where I am now,” Harry wrote quickly. “I’m at\\nHogwarts, and horrible stuff’s been happening. Do\\nyou know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?”\\nHis heart was hammering. Riddle’s reply came\\nquickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he\\nwas hurrying to tell all he knew.\\n“Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my\\nday, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist.\\nBut this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was\\nopened and the monster attacked several students,\\nfinally killing one. I caught the person who’d opened\\nthe Chamber and he was expelled. But the\\nheadmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a\\nthing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell\\nthe truth. A story was given out that the girl had died\\n \\nin a freak accident They gave me a nice, shiny,\\nengraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep\\nmy mouth shut But I knew it could happen again. The\\nmonster lived on, and the one who had the power to\\nrelease it was not imprisoned.”\\nHarry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write\\nback.\\n“It’s happening again now. There have been three\\nattacks and no one seems to know who’s behind\\nthem. Who was it last time?”\\n“ I can show you, if you like,” came Riddle’s reply. “You\\ndon’t have to take my word for it. I can take you inside\\nmy memory of the night when I caught him.”\\nHarry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary.\\nWhat did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside\\nsomebody else’s memory? He glanced nervously at the\\ndoor to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When\\nhe looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words\\nforming.\\n“Let me show you.”\\nHarry paused for a fraction of a second and then\\nwrote two letters.\\n“OK.”\\nThe pages of the diary began to blow as though\\ncaught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the\\nmonth of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that\\nthe little square for June thirteenth seemed to have\\nturned into a minuscule television screen. His hands\\ntrembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye\\nagainst the little window, and before he knew what\\nwas happening, he was tilting forward; the window\\n \\nwas widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he\\nwas pitched headfirst through the opening in the\\npage, into a whirl of color and shadow.\\nHe felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking,\\nas the blurred shapes around him came suddenly\\ninto focus.\\nHe knew immediately where he was. This circular\\nroom with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore’s\\noffice — but it wasn’t Dumbledore who was sitting\\nbehind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald\\nexcept for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a\\nletter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man\\nbefore.\\n“I’m sorry,” he said shakily. “I didn’t mean to butt in\\nBut the wizard didn’t look up. He continued to read,\\nfrowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and\\nstammered, “Er — I’ll just go, shall I?”\\nStill the wizard ignored him. He didn’t seem even to\\nhave heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be\\ndeaf, Harry raised his voice.\\n“Sorry I disturbed you. I’ll go now,” he half-shouted.\\nThe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up,\\nwalked past Harry without glancing at him, and went\\nto draw the curtains at his window.\\nThe sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed\\nto be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat\\ndown, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.\\nHarry looked around the office. No Fawkes the\\nphoenix — no whirring silver contraptions. This was\\n \\nHogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this\\nunknown wizard was headmaster, not Dumbledore,\\nand he, Harry, was little more than a phantom,\\ncompletely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.\\nThere was a knock on the office door.\\n“Enter,” said the old wizard in a feeble voice.\\nA boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed\\nhat. A silver prefect’s badge was glinting on his chest.\\nHe was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-\\nblack hair.\\n“Ah, Riddle,” said the headmaster.\\n“You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?” said\\nRiddle. He looked nervous.\\n“Sit down,” said Dippet. “I’ve just been reading the\\nletter you sent me.”\\n“Oh,” said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands\\ntogether very tightly.\\n“My dear boy,” said Dippet kindly, “I cannot possibly\\nlet you stay at school over the summer. Surely you\\nwant to go home for the holidays?”\\n“No,” said Riddle at once. “I’d much rather stay at\\nHogwarts than go back to that — to that — ”\\n“You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I\\nbelieve?” said Dippet curiously.\\n“Yes, sir,” said Riddle, reddening slightly.\\n“You are Muggle-born?”\\n \\n“Half-blood, sir,” said Riddle. “Muggle father, witch\\nmother.”\\n“And are both your parents — ?”\\n“My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told\\nme at the orphanage she lived just long enough to\\nname me — Tom after my father, Marvolo after my\\ngrandfather.”\\nDippet clucked his tongue sympathetically.\\n“The thing is, Tom,” he sighed, “special arrangements\\nmight have been made for you, but in the current\\ncircumstances. ...”\\n“You mean all these attacks, sir?” said Riddle, and\\nHarry’s heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of\\nmissing anything.\\n“Precisely,” said the headmaster. “My dear boy, you\\nmust see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to\\nremain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in\\nlight of the recent tragedy . . . the death of that poor\\nlittle girl. ... You will be safer by far at your\\norphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic\\nis even now talking about closing the school. We are\\nno nearer locating the — er — source of all this\\nunpleasantness. ...”\\nRiddle’s eyes had widened.\\n“Sir — if the person was caught — if it all stopped — ”\\n“What do you mean?” said Dippet with a squeak in\\nhis voice, sitting up in his chair. “Riddle, do you mean\\nyou know something about these attacks?”\\n“No, sir,” said Riddle quickly.\\n \\nBut Harry was sure it was the same sort of “no” that\\nhe himself had given Dumbledore.\\nDippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.\\n“You may go, Tom. ...”\\nRiddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room.\\nHarry followed him.\\nDown the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging\\nnext to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle\\nstopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could\\ntell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He\\nwas biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.\\nThen, as though he had suddenly reached a decision,\\nhe hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him.\\nThey didn’t see another person until they reached the\\nentrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping\\nauburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the\\nmarble staircase.\\n“What are you doing, wandering around this late,\\nTom?”\\nHarry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a\\nfifty-year-younger Dumbledore.\\n“I had to see the headmaster, sir,” said Riddle.\\n“Well, hurry off to bed,” said Dumbledore, giving\\nRiddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry\\nknew so well. “Best not to roam the corridors these\\ndays. Not since ...”\\nHe sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode\\noff. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then,\\n \\nmoving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps\\nto the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.\\nBut to Harry’s disappointment, Riddle led him not\\ninto a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to\\nthe very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with\\nSnape. The torches hadn’t been lit, and when Riddle\\npushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just\\nsee him, standing stock-still by the door, watching\\nthe passage outside.\\nIt felt to Harry that they were there for at least an\\nhour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the\\ndoor, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue.\\nAnd just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant\\nand tense and started wishing he could return to the\\npresent, he heard something move beyond the door.\\nSomeone was creeping along the passage. He heard\\nwhoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle\\nwere hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged\\nthrough the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind\\nhim, forgetting that he couldn’t be heard.\\nFor perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps,\\nuntil Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in\\nthe direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak\\nopen, and then someone speaking in a hoarse\\nwhisper.\\n“C’mon ... gotta get yeh outta here. ... C’mon now ...\\nin the box ...”\\nThere was something familiar about that voice. ...\\nRiddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry\\nstepped out behind him. He could see the dark\\noutline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of\\nan open door, a very large box next to it.\\n \\n“ ’Evening, Rubeus,” said Riddle sharply.\\nThe boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\\n“What yer doin’ down here, Tom?”\\nRiddle stepped closer.\\n“It’s all over,” he said. “I’m going to have to turn you\\nin, Rubeus. They’re talking about closing Hogwarts if\\nthe attacks don’t stop.”\\n“What d’yeh — ”\\n“I don’t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters\\ndon’t make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for\\nexercise and — ”\\n“It never killed no one!” said the large boy, backing\\nagainst the closed door. From behind him, Harry\\ncould hear a funny rustling and clicking.\\n“Come on, Rubeus,” said Riddle, moving yet closer.\\n“The dead girl’s parents will be here tomorrow. The\\nleast Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing\\nthat killed their daughter is slaughtered. ...”\\n“It wasn’t him!” roared the boy, his voice echoing in\\nthe dark passage. “He wouldn’! He never!”\\n“Stand aside,” said Riddle, drawing out his wand.\\nHis spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light.\\nThe door behind the large boy flew open with such\\nforce it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of\\nit came something that made Harry let out a long,\\npiercing scream unheard by anyone —\\n \\nA vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black\\nlegs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp\\npincers — Riddle raised his wand again, but he was\\ntoo late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled\\naway, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle\\nscrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his\\nwand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his\\nwand, and threw him back down, yelling,\\n“NOOOOOOO!”\\nThe scene whirled, the darkness became complete;\\nHarry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed\\nspread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor\\ndormitory, Riddle’s diary lying open on his stomach.\\nBefore he had had time to regain his breath, the\\ndormitory door opened and Ron came in.\\n“There you are,” he said.\\nHarry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\\n“What’s up?” said Ron, looking at him with concern.\\n“It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of\\nSecrets fifty years ago.”\\n \\nCORNELIUS FUDGE\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that\\nHagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and\\nmonstrous creatures. During their first year at\\nHogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little\\nwooden house, and it would be a long time before\\nthey forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d\\nchristened “Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard\\nthat a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle,\\nHarry was sure he’d have gone to any lengths for a\\nglimpse of it. He’d probably thought it was a shame\\nthat the monster had been cooped up so long, and\\nthought it deserved the chance to stretch its many\\nlegs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old\\nHagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he\\nwas equally certain that Hagrid would never have\\nmeant to kill anybody.\\nHarry half wished he hadn’t found out how to work\\nRiddle’s diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione\\nmade him recount what he’d seen, until he was\\nheartily sick of telling them and sick of the long,\\ncircular conversations that followed.\\n \\n“Riddle might have got the wrong person,” said\\nHermione. “Maybe it was some other monster that\\nwas attacking people. ...”\\n“How many monsters d’you think this place can\\nhold?” Ron asked dully.\\n“We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,” said\\nHarry miserably. “And the attacks must’ve stopped\\nafter Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle\\nwouldn’t have got his award.”\\nRon tried a different tack.\\n“Riddle does sound like Percy — who asked him to\\nsqueal on Hagrid, anyway?”\\n“But the monster had killed someone, Ron,” said\\nHermione.\\n“And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle\\norphanage if they closed Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I\\ndon’t blame him for wanting to stay here. ...”\\n“You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn’t you,\\nHarry?”\\n“He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” said\\nHarry quickly.\\nThe three of them fell silent. After a long pause,\\nHermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a\\nhesitant voice.\\n“Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it\\nall?”\\n \\n“That’d be a cheerful visit,” said Ron. “ ‘Hello, Hagrid.\\nTell us, have you been setting anything mad and\\nhairy loose in the castle lately?’ ”\\nIn the end, they decided that they would not say\\nanything to Hagrid unless there was another attack,\\nand as more and more days went by with no whisper\\nfrom the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that\\nthey would never need to talk to him about why he\\nhad been expelled. It was now nearly four months\\nsince Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been\\nPetrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that\\nthe attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good.\\nPeeves had finally got bored of his “Oh, Potter, you\\nrotter” song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite\\npolitely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in\\nHerbology one day, and in March several of the\\nMandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in\\ngreenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very\\nhappy.\\n“The moment they start trying to move into each\\nother’s pots, we’ll know they’re fully mature,” she told\\nHarry. “Then we’ll be able to revive those poor people\\nin the hospital wing.”\\nThe second years were given something new to think\\nabout during their Easter holidays. The time had\\ncome to choose their subjects for the third year, a\\nmatter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.\\n“It could affect our whole future,” she told Harry and\\nRon as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking\\nthem with checks.\\n“I just want to give up Potions,” said Harry.\\n \\n“We can’t,” said Ron gloomily. “We keep all our old\\nsubjects, or I’d’ve ditched Defense Against the Dark\\nArts.”\\n“But that’s very important!” said Hermione, shocked.\\n“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t\\nlearned anything from him except not to set pixies\\nloose.”\\nNeville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the\\nwitches and wizards in his family, all giving him\\ndifferent advice on what to choose. Confused and\\nworried, he sat reading the subject lists with his\\ntongue poking out, asking people whether they\\nthought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the\\nstudy of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like\\nHarry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing\\nhis eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking\\nthe subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody’s\\nadvice but signed up for everything.\\nHarry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried\\nto discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that\\nhe didn’t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager\\nto share his experience.\\n“Depends where you want to go, Harry,” he said. “It’s\\nnever too early to think about the future, so I’d\\nrecommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is\\na soft option, but I personally think wizards should\\nhave a thorough understanding of the non-magical\\ncommunity, particularly if they’re thinking of working\\nin close contact with them — look at my father, he\\nhas to deal with Muggle business all the time. My\\nbrother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type,\\nso he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your\\nstrengths, Harry.”\\n \\nBut the only thing Harry felt he was really good at\\nwas Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new\\nsubjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them,\\nat least he’d have someone friendly to help him.\\nGryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against\\nHufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices\\nevery night after dinner, so that Harry barely had\\ntime for anything but Quidditch and homework.\\nHowever, the training sessions were getting better, or\\nat least drier, and the evening before Saturday’s\\nmatch he went up to his dormitory to drop off his\\nbroomstick feeling Gryffindor’s chances for the\\nQuidditch Cup had never been better.\\nBut his cheerful mood didn’t last long. At the top of\\nthe stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville\\nLongbottom, who was looking frantic.\\n“Harry — I don’t know who did it — I just found — ”\\nWatching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the\\ndoor.\\nThe contents of Harry’s trunk had been thrown\\neverywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The\\nbedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the\\ndrawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet,\\nthe contents strewn over the mattress.\\nHarry walked over to the bed, openmouthed, treading\\non a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and\\nNeville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron,\\nDean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly.\\n“What happened, Harry?”\\n“No idea,” said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry’s\\nrobes. All the pockets were hanging out.\\n \\n“Someone’s been looking for something,” said Ron. “Is\\nthere anything missing?”\\nHarry started to pick up all his things and throw\\nthem into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last\\nof the Lockhart books back into it that he realized\\nwhat wasn’t there.\\n“Riddle’s diary’s gone,” he said in an undertone to\\nRon.\\n“What?”\\nHarry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and\\nRon followed him out. They hurried down to the\\nGryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and\\njoined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a\\nbook called Ancient Runes Made Easy.\\nHermione looked aghast at the news.\\n“But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody\\nelse knows our password — ”\\n“Exactly,” said Harry.\\nThey woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a\\nlight, refreshing breeze.\\n“Perfect Quidditch conditions!” said Wood\\nenthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the\\nteam’s plates with scrambled eggs. “Harry, buck up\\nthere, you need a decent breakfast.”\\nHarry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor\\ntable, wondering if the new owner of Riddle’s diary\\nwas right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been\\nurging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn’t like\\nthe idea. He’d have to tell a teacher all about the\\n \\ndiary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had\\nbeen expelled fifty years ago? He didn’t want to be the\\none who brought it all up again.\\nAs he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go\\nand collect his Quidditch things, another very serious\\nworry was added to Harry’s growing list. He had just\\nset foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet\\nagain —\\n“ Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear ...”\\nHe shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both\\njumped away from him in alarm.\\n“The voice!” said Harry, looking over his shoulder. “I\\njust heard it again — didn’t you?”\\nRon shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however,\\nclapped a hand to her forehead.\\n“Harry — I think I’ve just understood something! I’ve\\ngot to go to the library!”\\nAnd she sprinted away, up the stairs.\\n“ What does she understand?” said Harry distractedly,\\nstill looking around, trying to tell where the voice had\\ncome from.\\n“Loads more than I do,” said Ron, shaking his head.\\n“But why’s she got to go to the library?”\\n“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron,\\nshrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library.”\\nHarry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice\\nagain, but people were now emerging from the Great\\n \\nHall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the\\nfront doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.\\n“You’d better get moving,” said Ron. “It’s nearly eleven\\n— the match — ”\\nHarry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his\\nNimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd\\nswarming across the grounds, but his mind was still\\nin the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he\\npulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his\\nonly comfort was that everyone was now outside to\\nwatch the game.\\nThe teams walked onto the field to tumultuous\\napplause. Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight\\naround the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the\\nballs. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow,\\nwere standing in a huddle, having a last-minute\\ndiscussion of tactics.\\nHarry was just mounting his broom when Professor\\nMcGonagall came half marching, half running across\\nthe pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.\\nHarry’s heart dropped like a stone.\\n“This match has been canceled,” Professor\\nMcGonagall called through the megaphone,\\naddressing the packed stadium. There were boos and\\nshouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and\\nran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off\\nhis broomstick.\\n“But, Professor!” he shouted. “We’ve got to play — the\\nCup — Gryffindor — ”\\nProfessor McGonagall ignored him and continued to\\nshout through her megaphone:\\n \\n“All students are to make their way back to the House\\ncommon rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give\\nthem further information. As quickly as you can,\\nplease!”\\nThen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned\\nHarry over to her.\\n“Potter, I think you’d better come with me. ...”\\nWondering how she could possibly suspect him this\\ntime, Harry saw Ron detach himself from the\\ncomplaining crowd; he came running up to them as\\nthey set off toward the castle. To Harry’s surprise,\\nProfessor McGonagall didn’t object.\\n“Yes, perhaps you’d better come, too, Weasley. ...”\\nSome of the students swarming around them were\\ngrumbling about the match being canceled; others\\nlooked worried. Harry and Ron followed Professor\\nMcGonagall back into the school and up the marble\\nstaircase. But they weren’t taken to anybody’s office\\nthis time.\\n“This will be a bit of a shock,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they\\napproached the infirmary. “There has been another\\nattack ... another double attack.”\\nHarry’s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor\\nMcGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron\\nentered.\\nMadam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth-year girl\\nwith long, curly hair. Harry recognized her as the\\nRavenclaw they’d accidentally asked for directions to\\nthe Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to\\nher was —\\n \\n“HermioneY’ Ron groaned.\\nHermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.\\n“They were found near the library,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall. “I don’t suppose either of you can\\nexplain this? It was on the floor next to them. ...”\\nShe was holding up a small, circular mirror.\\nHarry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at\\nHermione.\\n“I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall heavily. “I need to address the\\nstudents in any case.”\\n“All students will return to their House common\\nrooms by six o’clock in the evening. No student is to\\nleave the dormitories after that time. You will be\\nescorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to\\nuse the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All\\nfurther Quidditch training and matches are to be\\npostponed. There will be no more evening activities.”\\nThe Gryffindors packed inside the common room\\nlistened to Professor McGonagall in silence. She rolled\\nup the parchment from which she had been reading\\nand said in a somewhat choked voice, “I need hardly\\nadd that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely\\nthat the school will be closed unless the culprit\\nbehind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone\\nwho thinks they might know anything about them to\\ncome forward.”\\nShe climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait\\nhole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately.\\n \\n“That’s two Gryffindors down, not counting a\\nGryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff,”\\nsaid the Weasley twins’ friend Lee Jordan, counting\\non his fingers. “Haven’t any of the teachers noticed\\nthat the Slytherins are all safe? Isn’t it obvious all this\\nstuff’s coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin,\\nthe monster of Slytherin — why don’t they just chuck\\nall the Slytherins out?” he roared, to nods and\\nscattered applause.\\nPercy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but\\nfor once he didn’t seem keen to make his views heard.\\nHe was looking pale and stunned.\\n“Percy’s in shock,” George told Harry quietly. “That\\nRavenclaw girl — Penelope Clearwater — she’s a\\nprefect. I don’t think he thought the monster would\\ndare attack a prefect.”\\nBut Harry was only half-listening. He didn’t seem to\\nbe able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on\\nthe hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if\\nthe culprit wasn’t caught soon, he was looking at a\\nlifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had\\nturned Hagrid in because he was faced with the\\nprospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed.\\nHarry now knew exactly how he had felt.\\n“What’re we going to do?” said Ron quietly in Harry’s\\near. “D’you think they suspect Hagrid?”\\n“We’ve got to go and talk to him,” said Harry, making\\nup his mind. “I can’t believe it’s him this time, but if\\nhe set the monster loose last time he’ll know how to\\nget inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.”\\n“But McGonagall said we’ve got to stay in our tower\\nunless we’re in class — ”\\n \\n“I think,” said Harry, more quietly still, “it’s time to\\nget my dad’s old cloak out again.”\\nHarry had inherited just one thing from his father: a\\nlong and silvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only\\nchance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid\\nwithout anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at\\nthe usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and\\nSeamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of\\nSecrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed\\nagain, and threw the cloak over themselves.\\nThe journey through the dark and deserted castle\\ncorridors wasn’t enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered\\nthe castle at night several times before, had never\\nseen it so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects,\\nand ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs,\\nstaring around for any unusual activity. Their\\nInvisibility Cloak didn’t stop them making any noise,\\nand there was a particularly tense moment when Ron\\nstubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape\\nstood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at\\nalmost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with\\nrelief that they reached the oak front doors and eased\\nthem open.\\nIt was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the\\nlit windows of Hagrid ’s house and pulled off the cloak\\nonly when they were right outside his front door.\\nSeconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open.\\nThey found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a\\ncrossbow at them. Fang the boarhound barked loudly\\nbehind him.\\n“Oh,” he said, lowering the weapon and staring at\\nthem. “What ’re you two doin’ here?”\\n \\n“What’s that for?” said Harry, pointing at the\\ncrossbow as they stepped inside.\\n“Nothin’ — nothin’ — “ Hagrid muttered. “I’ve bin\\nexpectin’ — doesn’ matter — Sit down — I’ll make tea\\nHe hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He\\nnearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the\\nkettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a\\nnervous jerk of his massive hand.\\n“Are you okay, Hagrid?” said Harry. “Did you hear\\nabout Hermione?”\\n“Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said Hagrid, a slight break in\\nhis voice.\\nHe kept glancing nervously at the windows. He\\npoured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had\\nforgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab\\nof fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock\\non the door.\\nHagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron\\nexchanged panic-stricken looks, then threw the\\nInvisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated\\ninto a corner. Hagrid checked that they were hidden,\\nseized his crossbow, and flung open his door once\\nmore.\\n“Good evening, Hagrid.”\\nIt was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly\\nserious, and was followed by a second, very odd-\\nlooking man.\\nThe stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious\\nexpression, and was wearing a strange mixture of\\n \\nclothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black\\ncloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he\\ncarried a lime-green bowler.\\n“That’s Dad’s boss!” Ron breathed. “Cornelius Fudge,\\nthe Minister of Magic!”\\nHarry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.\\nHagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into\\none of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to\\nCornelius Fudge.\\n“Bad business, Hagrid,” said Fudge in rather clipped\\ntones. “Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks\\non Muggle-borns. Things’ve gone far enough.\\nMinistry’s got to act.”\\n“I never,” said Hagrid, looking imploringly at\\nDumbledore. “You know I never, Professor\\nDumbledore, sir — ”\\n“I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my\\nfull confidence,” said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.\\n“Look, Albus,” said Fudge, uncomfortably. “Hagrid’s\\nrecord’s against him. Ministry’s got to do something\\n— the school governors have been in touch — ”\\n“Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid\\naway will not help in the slightest,” said Dumbledore.\\nHis blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen\\nbefore.\\n“Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge,\\nfidgeting with his bowler. “I’m under a lot of pressure.\\nGot to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it\\nwasn’t Hagrid, he’ll be back and no more said. But\\n \\nI’ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn’t be doing my\\nduty — ”\\n“Take me?” said Hagrid, who was trembling. “Take me\\nwhere?”\\n“For a short stretch only,” said Fudge, not meeting\\nHagrid ’s eyes. “Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a\\nprecaution. If someone else is caught, you’ll be let out\\nwith a full apology — ”\\n“Not Azkaban?” croaked Hagrid.\\nBefore Fudge could answer, there was another loud\\nrap on the door.\\nDumbledore answered it. It was Harry’s turn for an\\nelbow in the ribs; he’d let out an audible gasp.\\nMr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid’s hut, swathed\\nin a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and\\nsatisfied smile. Fang started to growl.\\n“Already here, Fudge,” he said approvingly. “Good,\\ngood...”\\n“What’re you doin’ here?” said Hagrid furiously. “Get\\noutta my house!”\\n“My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure\\nat all in being inside your — er — d’you call this a\\nhouse?” said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked\\naround the small cabin. “I simply called at the school\\nand was told that the headmaster was here.”\\n“And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?”\\nsaid Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was\\nstill blazing in his blue eyes.\\n \\n“ Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,” said Malfoy lazily,\\ntaking out a long roll of parchment, “but the\\ngovernors feel it’s time for you to step aside. This is\\nan Order of Suspension — you’ll find all twelve\\nsignatures on it. I’m afraid we feel you’re losing your\\ntouch. How many attacks have there been now? Two\\nmore this afternoon, wasn’t it? At this rate, there’ll be\\nno Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know\\nwhat an awful loss that would be to the school.”\\n“Oh, now, see here, Lucius,” said Fudge, looking\\nalarmed, “Dumbledore suspended — no, no — last\\nthing we want just now — ”\\n“The appointment — or suspension — of the\\nheadmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,”\\nsaid Mr. Malfoy smoothly. “And as Dumbledore has\\nfailed to stop these attacks — ”\\n“See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can’t stop them,”\\nsaid Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, “I\\nmean to say, who can?”\\n“That remains to be seen,” said Mr. Malfoy with a\\nnasty smile. “But as all twelve of us have voted — ”\\nHagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing\\nthe ceiling.\\n“An’ how many did yeh have ter threaten an’\\nblackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?” he roared.\\n“Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead\\nyou into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,” said Mr.\\nMalfoy. “I would advise you not to shout at the\\nAzkaban guards like that. They won’t like it at all.”\\n“Yeh can’ take Dumbledore!” yelled Hagrid, making\\nFang the boarhound cower and whimper in his\\n \\nbasket. “Take him away, an’ the Muggle-borns won’\\nstand a chance! There’ll be killin’ next!”\\n“Calm yourself, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore sharply. He\\nlooked at Lucius Malfoy.\\n“If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of\\ncourse step aside — ”\\n“But — ” stuttered Fudge.\\n“iVo!” growled Hagrid.\\nDumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off\\nLucius Malfoy’s cold gray ones.\\n“However,” said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly\\nand clearly so that none of them could miss a word,\\n“you will find that I will only truly have left this school\\nwhen none here are loyal to me. You will also find\\nthat help will always be given at Hogwarts to those\\nwho ask for it.”\\nFor a second, Harry was almost sure Dumbledore’s\\neyes flickered toward the corner where he and Ron\\nstood hidden.\\n“Admirable sentiments,” said Malfoy, bowing. “We\\nshall all miss your — er — highly individual way of\\nrunning things, Albus, and only hope that your\\nsuccessor will manage to prevent any — ah — killins.”\\nHe strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed\\nDumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler,\\nwaited for Hagrid to go ahead of him, but Hagrid\\nstood his ground, took a deep breath, and said\\ncarefully, “If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff,\\nall they’d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders.\\nThat’d lead ’em right! That’s all I’m sayin’.”\\n \\nFudge stared at him in amazement.\\n“All right, I’m cornin’,” said Hagrid, pulling on his\\nmoleskin overcoat. But as he was about to follow\\nFudge through the door, he stopped again and said\\nloudly, “An’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang while I’m\\naway.”\\nThe door banged shut and Ron pulled off the\\nInvisibility Cloak.\\n“We’re in trouble now,” he said hoarsely. “No\\nDumbledore. They might as well close the school\\ntonight. There’ll be an attack a day with him gone.”\\nFang started howling, scratching at the closed door.\\n \\nARAGOG\\nSummer was creeping over the grounds around the\\ncastle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and\\nflowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the\\ngreenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the\\ncastle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his\\nheels, the scene didn’t look right to Harry; no better,\\nin fact, than the inside of the castle, where things\\nwere so horribly wrong.\\nHarry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but\\nvisitors were now barred from the hospital wing.\\n“We’re taking no more chances,” Madam Pomfrey told\\nthem severely through a crack in the infirmary door.\\n“No, I’m sorry, there’s every chance the attacker might\\ncome back to finish these people off. ...”\\nWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never\\nbefore, so that the sun warming the castle walls\\noutside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows.\\nThere was barely a face to be seen in the school that\\ndidn’t look worried and tense, and any laughter that\\n \\nrang through the corridors sounded shrill and\\nunnatural and was quickly stifled.\\nHarry constantly repeated Dumbledore’s final words\\nto himself. “I will only truly have left this school when\\nnone here are loyal to me. . . . Help will always be given\\nat Hog warts to those who ask for it.” But what good\\nwere these words? Who exactly were they supposed to\\nask for help, when everyone was just as confused and\\nscared as they were?\\nHagrid’s hint about the spiders was far easier to\\nunderstand — the trouble was, there didn’t seem to\\nbe a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry\\nlooked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly)\\nby Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact\\nthat they weren’t allowed to wander off on their own\\nbut had to move around the castle in a pack with the\\nother Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students\\nseemed glad that they were being shepherded from\\nclass to class by teachers, but Harry found it very\\nirksome.\\nOne person, however, seemed to be thoroughly\\nenjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion.\\nDraco Malfoy was strutting around the school as\\nthough he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry\\ndidn’t realize what he was so pleased about until the\\nPotions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and\\nHagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy,\\nHarry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.\\n“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid\\nof Dumbledore,” he said, not troubling to keep his\\nvoice down. “I told you he thinks Dumbledore’s the\\nworst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll\\nget a decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t\\nwant the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall\\nwon’t last long, she’s only filling in. ...”\\n \\nSnape swept past Harry, making no comment about\\nHermione’s empty seat and cauldron.\\n“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t you apply for\\nthe headmaster’s job?”\\n“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t\\nsuppress a thin-lipped smile. “Professor Dumbledore\\nhas only been suspended by the governors. I daresay\\nhe’ll be back with us soon enough.”\\n“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I expect you’d\\nhave Father’s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the\\njob — I’ll tell Father you’re the best teacher here, sir\\nSnape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon,\\nfortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was\\npretending to vomit into his cauldron.\\n“I’m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven’t all packed\\ntheir bags by now,” Malfoy went on. “Bet you five\\nGalleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn’t Granger — ”\\nThe bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at\\nMalfoy’s last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in\\nthe scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts\\nto reach Malfoy went unnoticed.\\n“Let me at him,” Ron growled as Harry and Dean\\nhung onto his arms. “I don’t care, I don’t need my\\nwand, I’m going to kill him with my bare hands — ”\\n“Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,”\\nbarked Snape over the class’s heads, and off they\\nmarched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the\\nrear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only safe to\\nlet go of him when Snape had seen them out of the\\n \\ncastle and they were making their way across the\\nvegetable patch toward the greenhouses.\\nThe Herbology class was very subdued; there were\\nnow two missing from their number, Justin and\\nHermione.\\nProfessor Sprout set them all to work pruning the\\nAbyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of\\nwithered stalks onto the compost heap and found\\nhimself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took\\na deep breath and said, very formally, “I just want to\\nsay, Harry, that I’m sorry I ever suspected you. I\\nknow you’d never attack Hermione Granger, and I\\napologize for all the stuff I said. We’re all in the same\\nboat now, and, well — ”\\nHe held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.\\nErnie and his friend Hannah came to work at the\\nsame Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron.\\n“That Draco Malfoy character,” said Ernie, breaking\\noff dead twigs, “he seems very pleased about all this,\\ndoesn’t he? D’you know, I think he might be\\nSlytherin’s heir.”\\n“That’s clever of you,” said Ron, who didn’t seem to\\nhave forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry.\\n“Do you think it’s Malfoy, Harry?” Ernie asked.\\n“No,” said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah\\nstared.\\nA second later, Harry spotted something.\\nSeveral large spiders were scuttling over the ground\\non the other side of the glass, moving in an\\n \\nunnaturally straight line as though taking the\\nshortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit\\nRon over the hand with his pruning shears.\\n“Ouch\\\\ What ’re you — ”\\nHarry pointed out the spiders, following their progress\\nwith his eyes screwed up against the sun.\\n“Oh, yeah,” said Ron, trying, and failing, to look\\npleased. “But we can’t follow them now — ”\\nErnie and Hannah were listening curiously.\\nHarry’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If\\nthey pursued their fixed course, there could be no\\ndoubt about where they would end up.\\n“Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest.\\nAnd Ron looked even unhappier about that.\\nAt the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the\\nclass to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.\\nHarry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could\\ntalk out of earshot.\\n“Well have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,” Harry\\ntold Ron. “We can take Fang with us. He’s used to\\ngoing into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some\\nhelp.”\\n“Right,” said Ron, who was twirling his wand\\nnervously in his fingers. “Er — aren’t there — aren’t\\nthere supposed to be werewolves in the forest?” he\\nadded as they took their usual places at the back of\\nLockhart’s classroom.\\n \\nPreferring not to answer that question, Harry said,\\n“There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are\\nall right, and the unicorns ...”\\nRon had never been into the Forbidden Forest before.\\nHarry had entered it only once and had hoped never\\nto do so again.\\nLockhart bounded into the room and the class stared\\nat him. Every other teacher in the place was looking\\ngrimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing\\nshort of buoyant.\\n“Come now,” he cried, beaming around him. “Why all\\nthese long faces?”\\nPeople swapped exasperated looks, but nobody\\nanswered.\\n“Don’t you people realize,” said Lockhart, speaking\\nslowly, as though they were all a bit dim, “the danger\\nhas passed! The culprit has been taken away — ”\\n“Says who?” said Dean Thomas loudly.\\n“My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn’t\\nhave taken Hagrid if he hadn’t been one hundred\\npercent sure that he was guilty,” said Lockhart, in the\\ntone of someone explaining that one and one made\\ntwo.\\n“Oh, yes he would,” said Ron, even more loudly than\\nDean.\\n“I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid ’s\\narrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,” said Lockhart in a\\nself-satisfied tone.\\n \\nRon started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow,\\nbut stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him\\nhard under the desk.\\n“We weren’t there, remember?” Harry muttered.\\nBut Lockhart’s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that\\nhe had always thought Hagrid was no good, his\\nconfidence that the whole business was now at an\\nend, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw\\nGadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart’s stupid face.\\nInstead he contented himself with scrawling a note to\\nRon: Let’s do it tonight\\nRon read the message, swallowed hard, and looked\\nsideways at the empty seat usually filled by\\nHermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and\\nhe nodded.\\nThe Gryffindor common room was always very\\ncrowded these days, because from six o’clock onward\\nthe Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had\\nplenty to talk about, with the result that the common\\nroom often didn’t empty until past midnight.\\nHarry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his\\ntrunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting\\non it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George\\nchallenged Harry and Ron to a few games of\\nExploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very\\nsubdued in Hermione ’s usual chair. Harry and Ron\\nkept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games\\nquickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when\\nFred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.\\nHarry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two\\ndormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak,\\n \\nthrowing it over themselves, and climbing through the\\nportrait hole.\\nIt was another difficult journey through the castle,\\ndodging all the teachers. At last they reached the\\nentrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front\\ndoors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any\\ncreaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.\\n“ ’Course,” said Ron abruptly as they strode across\\nthe black grass, “we might get to the forest and find\\nthere’s nothing to follow. Those spiders might not’ve\\nbeen going there at all. I know it looked like they were\\nmoving in that sort of general direction, but ...”\\nHis voice trailed away hopefully.\\nThey reached Hagrid’s house, sad and sorry-looking\\nwith its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door\\nopen, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them.\\nWorried he might wake everyone at the castle with his\\ndeep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle\\ntoffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his\\nteeth together.\\nHarry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid’s table.\\nThere would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.\\n“C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said Harry,\\npatting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the\\nhouse behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest,\\nand lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.\\nHarry took out his wand, murmured, “Lumos\\\\” and a\\ntiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let\\nthem watch the path for signs of spiders.\\n“Good thinking,” said Ron. “I’d light mine, too, but\\nyou know — it’d probably blow up or something. ...”\\n \\nHarry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the\\ngrass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from\\nthe wandlight into the shade of the trees.\\n“Okay,” Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst,\\n“I’m ready. Let’s go.”\\nSo, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree\\nroots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow\\nof Harry’s wand, they followed the steady trickle of\\nspiders moving along the path. They walked behind\\nthem for about twenty minutes, not speaking,\\nlistening hard for noises other than breaking twigs\\nand rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become\\nthicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no\\nlonger visible, and Harry’s wand shone alone in the\\nsea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the\\npath.\\nHarry paused, trying to see where the spiders were\\ngoing, but everything outside his little sphere of light\\nwas pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the\\nforest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid\\nadvising him not to leave the forest path last time\\nhe’d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now,\\nprobably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also\\nsaid to follow the spiders.\\nSomething wet touched Harry’s hand and he jumped\\nbackward, crushing Ron’s foot, but it was only Fang’s\\nnose.\\n“What d’you reckon?” Harry said to Ron, whose eyes\\nhe could just make out, reflecting the light from his\\nwand.\\n“We’ve come this far,” said Ron.\\n \\nSo they followed the darting shadows of the spiders\\ninto the trees. They couldn’t move very quickly now;\\nthere were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely\\nvisible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang’s\\nhot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to\\nstop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the\\nspiders in the wandlight.\\nThey walked for what seemed like at least half an\\nhour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and\\nbrambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground\\nseemed to be sloping downward, though the trees\\nwere as thick as ever.\\nThen Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark,\\nmaking both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins.\\n“What?” said Ron loudly, looking around into the\\npitch-dark, and gripping Harry’s elbow very hard.\\n“There’s something moving over there,” Harry\\nbreathed. “Listen ... sounds like something big. ...”\\nThey listened. Some distance to their right, the\\nsomething big was snapping branches as it carved a\\npath through the trees.\\n“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh — ”\\n“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.”\\n“Hear me?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice.\\n“It’s already heard Fang!”\\nThe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs\\nas they stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange\\nrumbling noise and then silence.\\n“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry.\\n \\n“Probably getting ready to pounce,” said Ron.\\nThey waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.\\n“D’you think it’s gone?” Harry whispered.\\n“Dunno — ”\\nThen, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so\\nbright in the darkness that both of them flung up\\ntheir hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried\\nto run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped\\neven louder.\\n“Harry!” Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief.\\n“Harry, it’s our car!”\\n“What?”\\n“Come on!”\\nHarry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling\\nand tripping, and a moment later they had emerged\\ninto a clearing.\\nMr. Weasley’s car was standing, empty, in the middle\\nof a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense\\nbranches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked,\\nopenmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him,\\nexactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.\\n“It’s been here all the time!” said Ron delightedly,\\nwalking around the car. “Look at it. The forest’s\\nturned it wild. ...”\\nThe sides of the car were scratched and smeared with\\nmud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the\\nforest on its own. Fang didn’t seem at all keen on it;\\nhe kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering.\\n \\nHis breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his\\nwand back into his robes.\\n“And we thought it was going to attack us!” said Ron,\\nleaning against the car and patting it. “I wondered\\nwhere it had gone!”\\nHarry squinted around on the floodlit ground for\\nsigns of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away\\nfrom the glare of the headlights.\\n“We’ve lost the trail,” he said. “C’mon, let’s go and find\\nthem.”\\nRon didn’t speak. He didn’t move. His eyes were fixed\\non a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right\\nbehind Harry. His face was livid with terror.\\nHarry didn’t even have time to turn around. There\\nwas a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt\\nsomething long and hairy seize him around the\\nmiddle and lift him off the ground, so that he was\\nhanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard\\nmore clicking, and saw Ron’s legs leave the ground,\\ntoo, heard Fang whimpering and howling — next\\nmoment, he was being swept away into the dark\\ntrees.\\nHead hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him\\nwas marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the\\nfront two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining\\nblack pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of\\nthe creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were\\nmoving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could\\nhear Fang fighting to free himself from a third\\nmonster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn’t have\\nyelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left\\nhis voice back with the car in the clearing.\\n \\nHe never knew how long he was in the creature’s\\nclutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly\\nlifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn\\nground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his\\nneck sideways, he realized that they had reached the\\nridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared\\nof trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the\\nworst scene he had ever laid eyes on.\\nSpiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the\\nleaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-\\neyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive\\nspecimen that was carrying Harry made its way down\\nthe steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very\\ncenter of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all\\naround it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight\\nof its load.\\nHarry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider\\nreleased him. Ron and Fang thudded down next to\\nhim. Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but cowering\\nsilently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt.\\nHis mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent\\nscream and his eyes were popping.\\nHarry suddenly realized that the spider that had\\ndropped him was saying something. It had been hard\\nto tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word\\nhe spoke.\\n“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!”\\nAnd from the middle of the misty, domed web, a\\nspider the size of a small elephant emerged, very\\nslowly. There was gray in the black of his body and\\nlegs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head\\nwas milky white. He was blind.\\n“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.\\n \\n“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.\\n“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight\\nmilky eyes wandering vaguely.\\n“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.\\n“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping.\\n“We’re friends of Hagrid ’s,” Harry shouted. His heart\\nseemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat.\\nClick, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all\\naround the hollow.\\nAragog paused.\\n“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,”\\nhe said slowly.\\n“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast.\\n“That’s why we’ve come.”\\n“In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought\\nhe heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. “But\\nwhy has he sent you?”\\nHarry thought of getting to his feet but decided\\nagainst it; he didn’t think his legs would support him.\\nSo he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could.\\n“They think, up at the school, that Hagrid’s been\\nsetting a — a — something on students. They’ve\\ntaken him to Azkaban.”\\nAragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around\\nthe hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of\\n \\nspiders; it was like applause, except applause didn’t\\nusually make Harry feel sick with fear.\\n“But that was years ago,” said Aragog fretfully. “Years\\nand years ago. I remember it well. That’s why they\\nmade him leave the school. They believed that I was\\nthe monster that dwells in what they call the\\nChamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had\\nopened the Chamber and set me free.”\\n“And you ... you didn’t come from the Chamber of\\nSecrets?” said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his\\nforehead.\\n“I!” said Aragog, clicking angrily. “I was not born in\\nthe castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave\\nme to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was only a\\nboy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the\\ncastle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid is\\nmy good friend, and a good man. When I was\\ndiscovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he\\nprotected me. I have lived here in the forest ever\\nsince, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me\\na wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown,\\nall through Hagrid ’s goodness. ...”\\nHarry summoned what remained of his courage.\\n“So you never — never attacked anyone?”\\n“Never,” croaked the old spider. “It would have been\\nmy instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never\\nharmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed\\nwas discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of\\nthe castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our\\nkind like the dark and the quiet. ...”\\n \\n“But then . . . Do you know what did kill that girl?”\\nsaid Harry. “Because whatever it is, it’s back and\\nattacking people again — ”\\nHis words were drowned by a loud outbreak of\\nclicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting\\nangrily; large black shapes shifted all around him.\\n“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an\\nancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well\\ndo I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go,\\nwhen I sensed the beast moving about the school.”\\n“What is it?” said Harry urgently.\\nMore loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed\\nto be closing in.\\n“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do\\nnot name it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that\\ndread creature, though he asked me, many times.”\\nHarry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the\\nspiders pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to\\nbe tired of talking. He was backing slowly into his\\ndomed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch\\nslowly toward Harry and Ron.\\n“Well just go, then,” Harry called desperately to\\nAragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him.\\n“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. ...”\\n“But — but — ”\\n“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my\\ncommand. But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when\\nit wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye,\\nfriend of Hagrid.”\\n \\nHarry spun around. Feet away, towering above him,\\nwas a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes\\ngleaming in their ugly black heads.\\nEven as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was\\nno good, there were too many of them, but as he tried\\nto stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note\\nsounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the\\nhollow.\\nMr. Weasley’s car was thundering down the slope,\\nheadlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking\\nspiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs,\\ntheir endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched\\nto a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew\\nopen.\\n“Get Fang!” Harry yelled, diving into the front seat;\\nRon seized the boarhound around the middle and\\nthrew him, yelping, into the back of the car — the\\ndoors slammed shut — Ron didn’t touch the\\naccelerator but the car didn’t need him; the engine\\nroared and they were off, hitting more spiders. They\\nsped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were\\nsoon crashing through the forest, branches whipping\\nthe windows as the car wound its way cleverly\\nthrough the widest gaps, following a path it obviously\\nknew.\\nHarry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still\\nopen in the silent scream, but his eyes weren’t\\npopping anymore.\\n“Are you okay?”\\nRon stared straight ahead, unable to speak.\\nThey smashed their way through the undergrowth,\\nFang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw\\n \\nthe side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large\\noak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned,\\nand Harry could again see patches of sky.\\nThe car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly\\nthrown into the windshield. They had reached the\\nedge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in\\nhis anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the\\ndoor, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid’s house,\\ntail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a\\nminute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his\\nlimbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring.\\nHarry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back\\ninto the forest and disappeared from view.\\nHarry went back into Hagrid’s cabin to get the\\nInvisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a\\nblanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again,\\nhe found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin\\npatch.\\n“Follow the spiders,” said Ron weakly, wiping his\\nmouth on his sleeve. “I’ll never forgive Hagrid. We’re\\nlucky to be alive.”\\n“I bet he thought Aragog wouldn’t hurt friends of his,”\\nsaid Harry.\\n“That’s exactly Hagrid’s problem!” said Ron, thumping\\nthe wall of the cabin. “He always thinks monsters\\naren’t as bad as they’re made out, and look where it’s\\ngot him! A cell in Azkaban!” He was shivering\\nuncontrollably now. “What was the point of sending\\nus in there? What have we found out, I’d like to\\nknow?”\\n“That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,”\\nsaid Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding\\nhim in the arm to make him walk. “He was innocent.”\\n \\nRon gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in\\na cupboard wasn’t his idea of being innocent.\\nAs the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak\\nto make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the\\ncreaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back\\nacross the entrance hall and up the marble staircase,\\nholding their breath as they passed corridors where\\nwatchful sentries were walking. At last they reached\\nthe safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the\\nfire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off\\nthe cloak and climbed the winding stair to their\\ndormitory.\\nRon fell onto his bed without bothering to get\\nundressed. Harry, however, didn’t feel very sleepy. He\\nsat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about\\neverything Aragog had said.\\nThe creature that was lurking somewhere in the\\ncastle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster\\nVoldemort — even other monsters didn’t want to\\nname it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out\\nwhat it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even\\nHagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of\\nSecrets.\\nHarry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned\\nback against his pillows, watching the moon glinting\\nat him through the tower window.\\nHe couldn’t see what else they could do. They had hit\\ndead ends everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong\\nperson, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one\\ncould tell whether it was the same person, or a\\ndifferent one, who had opened the Chamber this time.\\nThere was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still\\nthinking about what Aragog had said.\\n \\nHe was becoming drowsy when what seemed like\\ntheir very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly\\nsat bolt upright.\\n“Ron,” he hissed through the dark, “Ron — ”\\nRon woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly\\naround, and saw Harry.\\n“Ron — that girl who died. Aragog said she was found\\nin a bathroom,” said Harry, ignoring Neville’s\\nsnuffling snores from the corner. “What if she never\\nleft the bathroom? What if she’s still there?”\\nRon rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight.\\nAnd then he understood, too.\\n“You don’t think — not Moaning Myrtle ?”\\n \\nTHE CHAMBER OF SECRETS\\nAll those times we were in that bathroom, and she\\nwas just three toilets away,” said Ron bitterly at\\nbreakfast next day, “and we could’ve asked her, and\\nnow ...”\\nIt had been hard enough trying to look for spiders.\\nEscaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a\\ngirls’ bathroom, the girls’ bathroom, moreover, right\\nnext to the scene of the first attack, was going to be\\nalmost impossible.\\nBut something happened in their first lesson,\\nTransfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets\\nout of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten\\nminutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told\\nthem that their exams would start on the first of\\nJune, one week from today.\\n“Exams?” howled Seamus Finnigan. “We’re still\\ngetting exams?”\\n \\nThere was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville\\nLongbottom’s wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs\\non his desk. Professor McGonagall restored it with a\\nwave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to\\nSeamus.\\n“The whole point of keeping the school open at this\\ntime is for you to receive your education,” she said\\nsternly. “The exams will therefore take place as usual,\\nand I trust you are all studying hard.”\\nStudying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that\\nthere would be exams with the castle in this state.\\nThere was a great deal of mutinous muttering around\\nthe room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl\\neven more darkly.\\n“Professor Dumbledore’s instructions were to keep the\\nschool running as normally as possible,” she said.\\n“And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out\\nhow much you have learned this year.”\\nHarry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was\\nsupposed to be turning into slippers. What had he\\nlearned so far this year? He couldn’t seem to think of\\nanything that would be useful in an exam.\\nRon looked as though he’d just been told he had to go\\nand live in the Forbidden Forest.\\n“Can you imagine me taking exams with this?” he\\nasked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just\\nstarted whistling loudly.\\nThree days before their first exam, Professor\\nMcGonagall made another announcement at\\nbreakfast.\\n \\n“I have good news,” she said, and the Great Hall,\\ninstead of falling silent, erupted.\\n“Dumbledore’s coming back!” several people yelled\\njoyfully.\\n“You’ve caught the Heir of Slytherin!” squealed a girl\\nat the Ravenclaw table.\\n“Quidditch matches are back on!” roared Wood\\nexcitedly.\\nWhen the hubbub had subsided, Professor\\nMcGonagall said, “Professor Sprout has informed me\\nthat the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last.\\nTonight, we will be able to revive those people who\\nhave been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that\\none of them may well be able to tell us who, or what,\\nattacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year\\nwill end with our catching the culprit.”\\nThere was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over\\nat the Slytherin table and wasn’t at all surprised to\\nsee that Draco Malfoy hadn’t joined in. Ron, however,\\nwas looking happier than he’d looked in days.\\n“It won’t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!” he\\nsaid to Harry. “Hermione’ll probably have all the\\nanswers when they wake her up! Mind you, she’ll go\\ncrazy when she finds out we’ve got exams in three\\ndays’ time. She hasn’t studied. It might be kinder to\\nleave her where she is till they’re over.”\\nJust then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down\\nnext to Ron. She looked tense and nervous, and Harry\\nnoticed that her hands were twisting in her lap.\\n“What’s up?” said Ron, helping himself to more\\nporridge.\\n \\nGinny didn’t say anything, but glanced up and down\\nthe Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face\\nthat reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn’t\\nthink who.\\n“Spit it out,” said Ron, watching her.\\nHarry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She\\nwas rocking backward and forward slightly in her\\nchair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering\\non the edge of revealing forbidden information.\\n“I’ve got to tell you something,” Ginny mumbled,\\ncarefully not looking at Harry.\\n“What is it?” said Harry.\\nGinny looked as though she couldn’t find the right\\nwords.\\n“What?” said Ron.\\nGinny opened her mouth, but no sound came out.\\nHarry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only\\nGinny and Ron could hear him.\\n“Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have\\nyou seen something? Someone acting oddly?”\\nGinny drew a deep breath and, at that precise\\nmoment, Percy Weasley appeared, looking tired and\\nwan.\\n“If you’ve finished eating, I’ll take that seat, Ginny. I’m\\nstarving, I’ve only just come off patrol duty.”\\nGinny jumped up as though her chair had just been\\nelectrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and\\n \\nscampered away. Percy sat down and grabbed a mug\\nfrom the center of the table.\\n“Percy!” said Ron angrily. “She was just about to tell\\nus something important!”\\nHalfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.\\n“What sort of thing?” he said, coughing.\\n“I just asked her if she’d seen anything odd, and she\\nstarted to say — ”\\n“Oh — that — that’s nothing to do with the Chamber\\nof Secrets,” said Percy at once.\\n“How do you know?” said Ron, his eyebrows raised.\\n“Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on\\nme the other day when I was — well, never mind —\\nthe point is, she spotted me doing something and I,\\num, I asked her not to mention it to anybody. I must\\nsay, I did think she’d keep her word. It’s nothing,\\nreally, I’d just rather — ”\\nHarry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.\\n“What were you doing, Percy?” said Ron, grinning.\\n“Go on, tell us, we won’t laugh.”\\nPercy didn’t smile back.\\n“Pass me those rolls, Harry, I’m starving.”\\nHarry knew the whole mystery might be solved\\ntomorrow without their help, but he wasn’t about to\\npass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up —\\nand to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were\\nbeing led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.\\n \\nLockhart, who had so often assured them that all\\ndanger had passed, only to be proved wrong right\\naway, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was\\nhardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the\\ncorridors. His hair wasn’t as sleek as usual; it seemed\\nhe had been up most of the night, patrolling the\\nfourth floor.\\n“Mark my words,” he said, ushering them around a\\ncorner. “The first words out of those poor Petrified\\npeople’s mouths will be ‘It was Hagrid.’ Frankly, I’m\\nastounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these\\nsecurity measures are necessary.”\\n“I agree, sir,” said Harry, making Ron drop his books\\nin surprise.\\n“Thank you, Harry,” said Lockhart graciously while\\nthey waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. “I\\nmean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on\\nwith, without walking students to classes and\\nstanding guard all night. ...”\\n“That’s right,” said Ron, catching on. “Why don’t you\\nleave us here, sir, we’ve only got one more corridor to\\ngo-”\\n“You know, Weasley, I think I will,” said Lockhart. “I\\nreally should go and prepare my next class — ”\\nAnd he hurried off.\\n“Prepare his class,” Ron sneered after him. “Gone to\\ncurl his hair, more like.”\\nThey let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of\\nthem, then darted down a side passage and hurried\\noff toward Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. But just as\\n \\nthey were congratulating each other on their brilliant\\nscheme —\\n“Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?”\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the\\nthinnest of thin lines.\\n“We were — we were — ” Ron stammered. “We were\\ngoing to — to go and see — ”\\n“Hermione,” said Harry. Ron and Professor\\nMcGonagall both looked at him.\\n“We haven’t seen her for ages, Professor,” Harry went\\non hurriedly, treading on Ron’s foot, “and we thought\\nwe’d sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell\\nher the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to\\nworry — ”\\nProfessor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for\\na moment, Harry thought she was going to explode,\\nbut when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky\\nvoice.\\n“Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear\\nglistening in her beady eye. “Of course, I realize this\\nhas all been hardest on the friends of those who have\\nbeen ... I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you\\nmay visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns\\nwhere you’ve gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given\\nmy permission.”\\nHarry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe\\nthat they’d avoided detention. As they turned the\\ncorner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall\\nblow her nose.\\n \\n“That,” said Ron fervently, “was the best story you’ve\\never come up with.”\\nThey had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing\\nand tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor\\nMcGonagall’s permission to visit Hermione.\\nMadam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.\\n“There’s just no point talking to a Petrified person,”\\nshe said, and they had to admit she had a point when\\nthey’d taken their seats next to Hermione. It was\\nplain that Hermione didn’t have the faintest inkling\\nthat she had visitors, and that they might just as well\\ntell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it\\nwould do.\\n“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said\\nRon, looking sadly at Hermione ’s rigid face. “Because\\nif he sneaked up on them all, no one’ll ever know. ...”\\nBut Harry wasn’t looking at Hermione’s face. He was\\nmore interested in her right hand. It lay clenched on\\ntop of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a\\npiece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.\\nMaking sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near,\\nhe pointed this out to Ron.\\n“Try and get it out,” Ron whispered, shifting his chair\\nso that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey’s view.\\nIt was no easy task. Hermione’s hand was clamped so\\ntightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was\\ngoing to tear it. While Ron kept watch he tugged and\\ntwisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the\\npaper came free.\\n \\nIt was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry\\nsmoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read\\nit, too.\\nOf the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam\\nour land, there is none more curious or more deadly\\nthan the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents.\\nThis snake, which may reach gigantic size and live\\nmany hundreds of years, is born from a chicken’s egg,\\nhatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are\\nmost wondrous, for aside from its deadly and\\nvenomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare,\\nand all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall\\nsuffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk,\\nfor it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only\\nfrom the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.\\nAnd beneath this, a single word had been written, in\\na hand Harry recognized as Hermione’s. Pipes.\\nIt was as though somebody had just flicked a light on\\nin his brain.\\n“Ron,” he breathed. “This is it. This is the answer. The\\nmonster in the Chamber’s a basilisk — a giant\\nserpent! That’s why I’ve been hearing that voice all\\nover the place, and nobody else has heard it. It’s\\nbecause I understand Parseltongue. ...”\\nHarry looked up at the beds around him.\\n“The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no\\none’s died — because no one looked it straight in the\\neye. Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk\\nburned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got\\nPetrified. Justin ... Justin must’ve seen the basilisk\\nthrough Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast\\n \\nof it, but he couldn’t die again ... and Hermione and\\nthat Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next\\nto them. Hermione had just realized the monster was\\na basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first\\nperson she met to look around corners with a mirror\\nfirst! And that girl pulled out her mirror — and — ”\\nRon’s jaw had dropped.\\n“And Mrs. Norris?” he whispered eagerly.\\nHarry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night\\nof Halloween.\\n“The water ...” he said slowly. “The flood from\\nMoaning Myrtle’s bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris\\nonly saw the reflection. ...”\\nHe scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more\\nhe looked at it, the more it made sense.\\n\"... The crowing of the rooster ... is fatal to if!” he read\\naloud. “Hagrid’s roosters were killed! The Heir of\\nSlytherin didn’t want one anywhere near the castle\\nonce the Chamber was opened! Spiders flee before it\\\\\\nIt all fits!”\\n“But how’s the basilisk been getting around the\\nplace?” said Ron. “A giant snake ... Someone would’ve\\nseen ...”\\nHarry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had\\nscribbled at the foot of the page.\\n“Pipes,” he said. “Pipes ... Ron, it’s been using the\\nplumbing. I’ve been hearing that voice inside the\\nwalls. ...”\\nRon suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm.\\n \\n“The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!” he said\\nhoarsely. “What if it’s a bathroom? What if it’s in — ”\\n“ — Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom,” said Harry.\\nThey sat there, excitement coursing through them,\\nhardly able to believe it.\\n“This means,” said Harry, “I can’t be the only\\nParselmouth in the school. The Heir of Slytherin’s\\none, too. That’s how he’s been controlling the\\nbasilisk.”\\n“What’re we going to do?” said Ron, whose eyes were\\nflashing. “Should we go straight to McGonagall?”\\n“Let’s go to the staffroom,” said Harry, jumping up.\\n“She’ll be there in ten minutes. It’s nearly break.”\\nThey ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered\\nhanging around in another corridor, they went\\nstraight into the deserted staffroom. It was a large,\\npaneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. Harry and\\nRon paced around it, too excited to sit down.\\nBut the bell to signal break never came.\\nInstead, echoing through the corridors came Professor\\nMcGonagall’s voice, magically magnified.\\n“All students to return to their House dormitories at\\nonce. All teachers return to the staffroom. Immediately,\\nplease.”\\nHarry wheeled around to stare at Ron.\\n“Not another attack? Not now?”\\n \\n“What’ll we do?” said Ron, aghast. “Go back to the\\ndormitory?”\\n“No,” said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly\\nsort of wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers’\\ncloaks. “In here. Let’s hear what it’s all about. Then\\nwe can tell them what we’ve found out.”\\nThey hid themselves inside it, listening to the\\nrumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and\\nthe staffroom door banging open. From between the\\nmusty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers\\nfiltering into the room. Some of them were looking\\npuzzled, others downright scared. Then Professor\\nMcGonagall arrived.\\n“It has happened,” she told the silent staffroom. “A\\nstudent has been taken by the monster. Right into\\nthe Chamber itself.”\\nProfessor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout\\nclapped her hands over her mouth. Snape gripped the\\nback of a chair very hard and said, “How can you be\\nsure?”\\n“The Heir of Slytherin,” said Professor McGonagall,\\nwho was very white, “left another message. Right\\nunderneath the first one. ‘Her skeleton will lie in the\\nChamber forever.’ ”\\nProfessor Flitwick burst into tears.\\n“Who is it?” said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-\\nkneed, into a chair. “Which student?”\\n“Ginny Weasley,” said Professor McGonagall.\\nHarry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe\\nfloor beside him.\\n \\n“We shall have to send all the students home\\ntomorrow,” said Professor McGonagall. “This is the\\nend of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always said ...”\\nThe staffroom door banged open again. For one wild\\nmoment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore.\\nBut it was Lockhart, and he was beaming.\\n“So sorry — dozed off — what have I missed?”\\nHe didn’t seem to notice that the other teachers were\\nlooking at him with something remarkably like\\nhatred. Snape stepped forward.\\n“Just the man,” he said. “The very man. A girl has\\nbeen snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into\\nthe Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come\\nat last.”\\nLockhart blanched.\\n“That’s right, Gilderoy,” chipped in Professor Sprout.\\n“Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known\\nall along where the entrance to the Chamber of\\nSecrets is?”\\n“I — well, I — ” sputtered Lockhart.\\n“Yes, didn’t you tell me you were sure you knew what\\nwas inside it?” piped up Professor Flitwick.\\n“D-did I? I don’t recall — ”\\n“I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you\\nhadn’t had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was\\narrested,” said Snape. “Didn’t you say that the whole\\naffair had been bungled, and that you should have\\nbeen given a free rein from the first?”\\n \\nLockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.\\n“I — I really never — you may have misunderstood — ”\\n“Well leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall. “Tonight will be an excellent time to do\\nit. Well make sure everyone’s out of your way. You’ll\\nbe able to tackle the monster all by yourself. A free\\nrein at last.”\\nLockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody\\ncame to the rescue. He didn’t look remotely handsome\\nanymore. His lip was trembling, and in the absence of\\nhis usually toothy grin, he looked weak-chinned and\\nfeeble.\\n“V-very well,” he said. “I’ll — I’ll be in my office,\\ngetting — getting ready.”\\nAnd he left the room.\\n“Right,” said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils\\nwere flared, “that’s got him out from under our feet.\\nThe Heads of Houses should go and inform their\\nstudents what has happened. Tell them the Hogwarts\\nExpress will take them home first thing tomorrow.\\nWill the rest of you please make sure no students\\nhave been left outside their dormitories.”\\nThe teachers rose and left, one by one.\\nIt was probably the worst day of Harry’s entire life.\\nHe, Ron, Fred, and George sat together in a corner of\\nthe Gryffindor common room, unable to say anything\\nto each other. Percy wasn’t there. He had gone to\\nsend an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut\\nhimself up in his dormitory.\\n \\nNo afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had\\nGryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet.\\nNear sunset, Fred and George went up to bed, unable\\nto sit there any longer.\\n“She knew something, Harry,” said Ron, speaking for\\nthe first time since they had entered the wardrobe in\\nthe staffroom. “That’s why she was taken. It wasn’t\\nsome stupid thing about Percy at all. She’d found out\\nsomething about the Chamber of Secrets. That must\\nbe why she was — ” Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. “I\\nmean, she was a pureblood. There can’t be any other\\nreason.”\\nHarry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the\\nskyline. This was the worst he had ever felt. If only\\nthere was something they could do. Anything.\\n“Harry,” said Ron. “D’you think there’s any chance at\\nall she’s not — you know — ”\\nHarry didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t see how\\nGinny could still be alive.\\n“D’you know what?” said Ron. “I think we should go\\nand see Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He’s going\\nto try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him\\nwhere we think it is, and tell him it’s a basilisk in\\nthere.”\\nBecause Harry couldn’t think of anything else to do,\\nand because he wanted to be doing something, he\\nagreed. The Gryffindors around them were so\\nmiserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that\\nnobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the\\nroom, and left through the portrait hole.\\nDarkness was falling as they walked down to\\nLockhart’s office. There seemed to be a lot of activity\\n \\ngoing on inside it. They could hear scraping, thumps,\\nand hurried footsteps.\\nHarry knocked and there was a sudden silence from\\ninside. Then the door opened the tiniest crack and\\nthey saw one of Lockhart’s eyes peering through it.\\n“Oh — Mr. Potter — Mr. Weasley — ” he said, opening\\nthe door a bit wider. “I’m rather busy at the moment\\n— if you would be quick — ”\\n“Professor, we’ve got some information for you,” said\\nHarry. “We think it’ll help you.”\\n“Er — well — it’s not terribly — ” The side of\\nLockhart’s face that they could see looked very\\nuncomfortable. “I mean — well — all right — ”\\nHe opened the door and they entered.\\nHis office had been almost completely stripped. Two\\nlarge trunks stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-\\ngreen, lilac, midnight-blue, had been hastily folded\\ninto one of them; books were jumbled untidily into\\nthe other. The photographs that had covered the walls\\nwere now crammed into boxes on the desk.\\n“Are you going somewhere?” said Harry.\\n“Er, well, yes,” said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster\\nof himself from the back of the door as he spoke and\\nstarting to roll it up. “Urgent call — unavoidable —\\ngot to go — ”\\n“What about my sister?” said Ron jerkily.\\n“Well, as to that — most unfortunate — ” said\\nLockhart, avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open a\\n \\ndrawer and started emptying the contents into a bag.\\n“No one regrets more than I — ”\\n“You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!”\\nsaid Harry. “You can’t go now! Not with all the Dark\\nstuff going on here!”\\n“Well — I must say — when I took the job — ”\\nLockhart muttered, now piling socks on top of his\\nrobes, “nothing in the job description — didn’t expect\\n“You mean you’re running away? said Harry\\ndisbelievingly. “After all that stuff you did in your\\nbooks — ”\\n“Books can be misleading,” said Lockhart delicately.\\n“You wrote them!” Harry shouted.\\n“My dear boy,” said Lockhart, straightening up and\\nfrowning at Harry. “Do use your common sense. My\\nbooks wouldn’t have sold half as well if people didn’t\\nthink I’d done all those things. No one wants to read\\nabout some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did\\nsave a village from werewolves. He’d look dreadful on\\nthe front cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch\\nwho banished the Bandon Banshee had a hairy chin.\\nI mean, come on — ”\\n“So you’ve just been taking credit for what a load of\\nother people have done?” said Harry incredulously.\\n“Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, shaking his head\\nimpatiently, “it’s not nearly as simple as that. There\\nwas work involved. I had to track these people down.\\nAsk them exactly how they managed to do what they\\ndid. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so\\nthey wouldn’t remember doing it. If there’s one thing I\\n \\npride myself on, it’s my Memory Charms. No, it’s been\\na lot of work, Harry. It’s not all book signings and\\npublicity photos, you know. You want fame, you have\\nto be prepared for a long hard slog.”\\nHe banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked\\nthem.\\n“Let’s see,” he said. “I think that’s everything. Yes.\\nOnly one thing left.”\\nHe pulled out his wand and turned to them.\\n“Awfully sorry, boys, but I’ll have to put a Memory\\nCharm on you now. Can’t have you blabbing my\\nsecrets all over the place. I’d never sell another book\\nHarry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had\\nbarely raised his, when Harry bellowed,\\n“ Expelliarmus\\\\ ”\\nLockhart was blasted backward, falling over his\\ntrunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it,\\nand flung it out of the open window.\\n“Shouldn’t have let Professor Snape teach us that\\none,” said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk\\naside. Lockhart was looking up at him, feeble once\\nmore. Harry was still pointing his wand at him.\\n“What d’you want me to do?” said Lockhart weakly. “I\\ndon’t know where the Chamber of Secrets is. There’s\\nnothing I can do.”\\n“You’re in luck,” said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his\\nfeet at wandpoint. “We think we know where it is.\\nAnd what’s inside it. Let’s go.”\\n \\nThey marched Lockhart out of his office and down the\\nnearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the\\nmessages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning\\nMyrtle’s bathroom.\\nThey sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see\\nthat he was shaking.\\nMoaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end\\ntoilet.\\n“Oh, it’s you,” she said when she saw Harry. “What do\\nyou want this time?”\\n“To ask you how you died,” said Harry.\\nMyrtle’s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as\\nthough she had never been asked such a flattering\\nquestion.\\n“Ooooh, it was dreadful,” she said with relish. “It\\nhappened right in here. I died in this very stall. I\\nremember it so well. I’d hidden because Olive Hornby\\nwas teasing me about my glasses. The door was\\nlocked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody\\ncome in. They said something funny. A different\\nlanguage, I think it must have been. Anyway, what\\nreally got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I\\nunlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own\\ntoilet, and then — ” Myrtle swelled importantly, her\\nface shining. “I died.”\\n“How?” said Harry.\\n“No idea,” said Myrtle in hushed tones. “I just\\nremember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. My\\nwhole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating\\naway. ...” She looked dreamily at Harry. “And then I\\ncame back again. I was determined to haunt Olive\\n \\nHornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she’d ever\\nlaughed at my glasses.”\\n“Where exactly did you see the eyes?” said Harry.\\n“Somewhere there,” said Myrtle, pointing vaguely\\ntoward the sink in front of her toilet.\\nHarry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was\\nstanding well back, a look of utter terror on his face.\\nIt looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every\\ninch of it, inside and out, including the pipes below.\\nAnd then Harry saw it: Scratched on the side of one of\\nthe copper taps was a tiny snake.\\n“That tap’s never worked,” said Myrtle brightly as he\\ntried to turn it.\\n“Harry,” said Ron. “Say something. Something in\\nParseltongue.”\\n“But — ” Harry thought hard. The only times he’d ever\\nmanaged to speak Parseltongue were when he’d been\\nfaced with a real snake. He stared hard at the tiny\\nengraving, trying to imagine it was real.\\n“Open up,” he said.\\nHe looked at Ron, who shook his head.\\n“English,” he said.\\nHarry looked back at the snake, willing himself to\\nbelieve it was alive. If he moved his head, the\\ncandlelight made it look as though it were moving.\\n“Open up,” he said.\\n \\nExcept that the words weren’t what he heard; a\\nstrange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap\\nglowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin.\\nNext second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact,\\nsank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed,\\na pipe wide enough for a man to slide into.\\nHarry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had\\nmade up his mind what he was going to do.\\n“I’m going down there,” he said.\\nHe couldn’t not go, not now they had found the\\nentrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the\\nfaintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might\\nbe alive.\\n“Me too,” said Ron.\\nThere was a pause.\\n“Well, you hardly seem to need me,” said Lockhart,\\nwith a shadow of his old smile. “I’ll just — ”\\nHe put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry\\nboth pointed their wands at him.\\n“You can go first,” Ron snarled.\\nWhite-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the\\nopening.\\n“Boys,” he said, his voice feeble. “Boys, what good will\\nit do?”\\nHarry jabbed him in the back with his wand.\\nLockhart slid his legs into the pipe.\\n \\n“I really don’t think — ” he started to say, but Ron\\ngave him a push, and he slid out of sight. Harry\\nfollowed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into the\\npipe, then let go.\\nIt was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark\\nslide. He could see more pipes branching off in all\\ndirections, but none as large as theirs, which twisted\\nand turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew\\nthat he was falling deeper below the school than even\\nthe dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron,\\nthudding slightly at the curves.\\nAnd then, just as he had begun to worry about what\\nwould happen when he hit the ground, the pipe\\nleveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet\\nthud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone\\ntunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting\\nto his feet a little ways away, covered in slime and\\nwhite as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came\\nwhizzing out of the pipe, too.\\n“We must be miles under the school,” said Harry, his\\nvoice echoing in the black tunnel.\\n“Under the lake, probably,” said Ron, squinting\\naround at the dark, slimy walls.\\nAll three of them turned to stare into the darkness\\nahead.\\n“Lumosl” Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again.\\n“C’mon,” he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they\\nwent, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor.\\nThe tunnel was so dark that they could only see a\\nlittle distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls\\nlooked monstrous in the wandlight.\\n \\n“Remember,” Harry said quietly as they walked\\ncautiously forward, “any sign of movement, close your\\neyes right away. ...”\\nBut the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first\\nunexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as\\nRon stepped on what turned out to be a rat’s skull.\\nHarry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw\\nthat it was littered with small animal bones. Trying\\nvery hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if\\nthey found her, Harry led the way forward, around a\\ndark bend in the tunnel.\\n“Harry — there’s something up there — ” said Ron\\nhoarsely, grabbing Harry’s shoulder.\\nThey froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline\\nof something huge and curved, lying right across the\\ntunnel. It wasn’t moving.\\n“Maybe it’s asleep,” he breathed, glancing back at the\\nother two. Lockhart’s hands were pressed over his\\neyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart\\nbeating so fast it hurt.\\nVery slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make\\nthem and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand\\nheld high.\\nThe light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid,\\npoisonous green, lying curled and empty across the\\ntunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have\\nbeen twenty feet long at least.\\n“Blimey,” said Ron weakly.\\nThere was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy\\nLockhart’s knees had given way.\\n \\n“Get up,” said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at\\nLockhart.\\nLockhart got to his feet — then he dived at Ron,\\nknocking him to the ground.\\nHarry jumped forward, but too late — Lockhart was\\nstraightening up, panting, Ron’s wand in his hand\\nand a gleaming smile back on his face.\\n“The adventure ends here, boys!” he said. “I shall take\\na bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I\\nwas too late to save the girl, and that you two\\ntragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled\\nbody — say good-bye to your memories!”\\nHe raised Ron’s Spellotaped wand high over his head\\nand yelled, “Obliviatel”\\nThe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb.\\nHarry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping\\nover the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great\\nchunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the\\nfloor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at\\na solid wall of broken rock.\\n“Ron!” he shouted. “Are you okay? Ron!”\\n“I’m here!” came Ron’s muffled voice from behind the\\nrock-fall. “I’m okay — this git’s not, though — he got\\nblasted by the wand — ”\\nThere was a dull thud and a loud “ow!” It sounded as\\nthough Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins.\\n“What now?” Ron’s voice said, sounding desperate.\\n“We can’t get through — it’ll take ages. ...”\\n \\nHarry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks\\nhad appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart\\nanything as large as these rocks by magic, and now\\ndidn’t seem a good moment to try — what if the whole\\ntunnel caved in?\\nThere was another thud and another “ow!” from\\nbehind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had\\nalready been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours. ...\\nHarry knew there was only one thing to do.\\n“Wait there,” he called to Ron. “Wait with Lockhart. I’ll\\ngo on. ... If I’m not back in an hour ...”\\nThere was a very pregnant pause.\\n“I’ll try and shift some of this rock,” said Ron, who\\nseemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. “So you\\ncan — can get back through. And, Harry — ”\\n“See you in a bit,” said Harry, trying to inject some\\nconfidence into his shaking voice.\\nAnd he set off alone past the giant snake skin.\\nSoon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the\\nrocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again.\\nEvery nerve in Harry’s body was tingling\\nunpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet\\ndreaded what he’d find when it did. And then, at last,\\nas he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid\\nwall ahead on which two entwined serpents were\\ncarved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.\\nHarry approached, his throat very dry. There was no\\nneed to pretend these stone snakes were real; their\\neyes looked strangely alive.\\n \\nHe could guess what he had to do. He cleared his\\nthroat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker.\\n“Open,” said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.\\nThe serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the\\nhalves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking\\nfrom head to foot, walked inside.\\n \\nTHE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN\\nHe was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit\\nchamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more\\ncarved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in\\ndarkness, casting long, black shadows through the\\nodd, greenish gloom that filled the place.\\nHis heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to\\nthe chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a\\nshadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was\\nGinny?\\nHe pulled out his wand and moved forward between\\nthe serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed\\nloudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes\\nnarrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest\\nsign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone\\nsnakes seemed to be following him. More than once,\\nwith a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir.\\nThen, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a\\nstatue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view,\\nstanding against the back wall.\\n \\nHarry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant\\nface above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a\\nlong, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the\\nwizard’s sweeping stone robes, where two enormous\\ngray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And\\nbetween the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed\\nfigure with flaming-red hair.\\n“Ginnyl” Harry muttered, sprinting to her and\\ndropping to his knees. “Ginny — don’t be dead —\\nplease don’t be dead — ” He flung his wand aside,\\ngrabbed Ginny’s shoulders, and turned her over. Her\\nface was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes\\nwere closed, so she wasn’t Petrified. But then she\\nmust be —\\n“Ginny, please wake up,” Harry muttered desperately,\\nshaking her. Ginny’s head lolled hopelessly from side\\nto side.\\n“She won’t wake,” said a soft voice.\\nHarry jumped and spun around on his knees.\\nA tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the\\nnearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred\\naround the edges, as though Harry were looking at\\nhim through a misted window. But there was no\\nmistaking him —\\n“Tom — Tom Riddle?”\\nRiddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry’s face.\\n“What d’you mean, she won’t wake?” Harry said\\ndesperately. “She’s not — she’s not — ?”\\n“She’s still alive,” said Riddle. “But only just.”\\n \\nHarry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at\\nHogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird,\\nmisty light shining about him, not a day older than\\nsixteen.\\n“Are you a ghost?” Harry said uncertainly.\\n“A memory,” said Riddle quietly. “Preserved in a diary\\nfor fifty years.”\\nHe pointed toward the floor near the statue’s giant\\ntoes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry\\nhad found in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. For a\\nsecond, Harry wondered how it had got there — but\\nthere were more pressing matters to deal with.\\n“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” Harry said, raising\\nGinny’s head again. “We’ve got to get her out of here.\\nThere’s a basilisk ... I don’t know where it is, but it\\ncould be along any moment. ... Please, help me — ”\\nRiddle didn’t move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist\\nGinny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand\\nagain.\\nBut his wand had gone.\\n“Did you see — ?”\\nHe looked up. Riddle was still watching him —\\ntwirling Harry’s wand between his long fingers.\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.\\nA smile curled the corners of Riddle’s mouth. He\\ncontinued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.\\n \\n“Listen,” said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with\\nGinny’s dead weight. “We’ve got to go\\\\ If the basilisk\\ncomes — ”\\n“It won’t come until it is called,” said Riddle calmly.\\nHarry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to\\nhold her up any longer.\\n“What d’you mean?” he said. “Look, give me my wand,\\nI might need it — ”\\nRiddle’s smile broadened.\\n“You won’t be needing it,” he said.\\nHarry stared at him.\\n“What d’you mean, I won’t be — ?”\\n“I’ve waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,” said\\nRiddle. “For the chance to see you. To speak to you.”\\n“Look,” said Harry, losing patience, “I don’t think you\\nget it. We’re in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk\\nlater — ”\\n“We’re going to talk now,” said Riddle, still smiling\\nbroadly, and he pocketed Harry’s wand.\\nHarry stared at him. There was something very funny\\ngoing on here. ...\\n“How did Ginny get like this?” he asked slowly.\\n“Well, that’s an interesting question,” said Riddle\\npleasantly. “And quite a long story. I suppose the real\\nreason Ginny Weasley’s like this is because she\\n \\nopened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an\\ninvisible stranger.”\\n“What are you talking about?” said Harry.\\n“The diary,” said Riddle. “My diary. Little Ginny’s been\\nwriting in it for months and months, telling me all her\\npitiful worries and woes — how her brothers tease\\nher, how she had to come to school with secondhand\\nrobes and books, how” — Riddle’s eyes glinted —\\n“how she didn’t think famous, good, great Harry\\nPotter would ever like her. ...”\\nAll the time he spoke, Riddle’s eyes never left Harry’s\\nface. There was an almost hungry look in them.\\n“It’s very boring, having to listen to the silly little\\ntroubles of an eleven-year-old girl,” he went on. “But I\\nwas patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was\\nkind. Ginny simply loved me. No one’s ever\\nunderstood me like you, Tom. ... I’m so glad I’ve got\\nthis diary to confide in. ... It’s like having a friend I can\\ncarry around in my pocket. ...”\\nRiddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn’t suit\\nhim. It made the hairs stand up on the back of\\nHarry’s neck.\\n“If I say it myself, Harry, I’ve always been able to\\ncharm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her\\nsoul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what\\nI wanted. ... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of\\nher deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew\\npowerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley.\\nPowerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few\\nof my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back\\ninto her ...”\\n \\n“What d’you mean?” said Harry, whose mouth had\\ngone very dry.\\n“Haven’t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?” said Riddle\\nsoftly. “Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of\\nSecrets. She strangled the school roosters and\\ndaubed threatening messages on the walls. She set\\nthe Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the\\nSquib’s cat.”\\n“No,” Harry whispered.\\n“Yes,” said Riddle, calmly. “Of course, she didn’t know\\nwhat she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I\\nwish you could have seen her new diary entries . . . far\\nmore interesting, they became. ... Dear Tom,” he\\nrecited, watching Harry’s horrified face, “7 think I’m\\nlosing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over\\nmy robes and I don’t know how they got there. Dear\\nTom, I can’t remember what I did on the night of\\nHalloween, but a cat was attacked and I’ve got paint\\nall down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me\\nI’m pale and I’m not myself. I think he suspects me. . . .\\nThere was another attack today and I don’t know\\nwhere I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I’m\\ngoing mad. ... I think I’m the one attacking everyone,\\nTom\\\\”\\nHarry’s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep\\ninto his palms.\\n“It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop\\ntrusting her diary,” said Riddle. “But she finally\\nbecame suspicious and tried to dispose of it. And\\nthat’s where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I\\ncouldn’t have been more delighted. Of all the people\\nwho could have picked it up, it was you, the very\\nperson I was most anxious to meet. ...”\\n \\n“And why did you want to meet me?” said Harry.\\nAnger was coursing through him, and it was an effort\\nto keep his voice steady.\\n“Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,”\\nsaid Riddle. “Your whole fascinating history.” His eyes\\nroved over the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead, and\\ntheir expression grew hungrier. “I knew I must find\\nout more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could.\\nSo I decided to show you my famous capture of that\\ngreat oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust — ”\\n“Hagrid’s my friend,” said Harry, his voice now\\nshaking. “And you framed him, didn’t you? I thought\\nyou made a mistake, but — ”\\nRiddle laughed his high laugh again.\\n“It was my word against Hagrid’s, Harry. Well, you\\ncan imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On\\nthe one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant,\\nparentless but so brave, school prefect, model student\\n... on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in\\ntrouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf\\ncubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden\\nForest to wrestle trolls ... but I admit, even / was\\nsurprised how well the plan worked. I thought\\nsomeone must realize that Hagrid couldn’t possibly be\\nthe Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years\\nto find out everything I could about the Chamber of\\nSecrets and discover the secret entrance ... as though\\nHagrid had the brains, or the power!\\n“Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore,\\nseemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded\\nDippet to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper.\\nYes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed. ...\\nDumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the\\nother teachers did. ...”\\n \\n“I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,” said\\nHarry, his teeth gritted.\\n“Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on\\nme after Hagrid was expelled,” said Riddle carelessly.\\n“I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again\\nwhile I was still at school. But I wasn’t going to waste\\nthose long years I’d spent searching for it. I decided to\\nleave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old\\nself in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would\\nbe able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish\\nSalazar Slytherin’s noble work.”\\n“Well, you haven’t finished it,” said Harry\\ntriumphantly. “No one’s died this time, not even the\\ncat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be\\nready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right\\nagain — ”\\n“Haven’t I already told you,” said Riddle quietly, “that\\nkilling Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore? For\\nmany months now, my new target has been — you.”\\nHarry stared at him.\\n“Imagine how angry I was when the next time my\\ndiary was opened, it was Ginny who was writing to\\nme, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and\\npanicked. What if you found out how to work it, and I\\nrepeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I\\ntold you who’d been strangling roosters? So the\\nfoolish little brat waited until your dormitory was\\ndeserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must\\ndo. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of\\nSlytherin’s heir. From everything Ginny had told me\\nabout you, I knew you would go to any lengths to\\nsolve the mystery — particularly if one of your best\\nfriends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the\\n \\nwhole school was buzzing because you could speak\\nParseltongue. ...\\n“So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall\\nand come down here to wait. She struggled and cried\\nand became very boring. But there isn’t much life left\\nin her. ... She put too much into the diary, into me.\\nEnough to let me leave its pages at last. ... I have\\nbeen waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I\\nknew you’d come. I have many questions for you,\\nHarry Potter.”\\n“Like what?” Harry spat, fists still clenched.\\n“Well,” said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, “how is it that\\nyou — a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical\\ntalent — managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all\\ntime? How did you escape with nothing but a scar,\\nwhile Lord Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?”\\nThere was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.\\n“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly.\\n“Voldemort was after your time. ...”\\n“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present,\\nand future, Harry Potter. ...”\\nHe pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to\\ntrace it through the air, writing three shimmering\\nwords:\\ntom marvolo riddle\\nThen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his\\nname rearranged themselves:\\ni am lord voldemort\\n \\n“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already\\nusing at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only,\\nof course. You think I was going to use my filthy\\nMuggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs\\nthe blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my\\nmother’s side? I, keep the name of a foul, common\\nMuggle, who abandoned me even before I was born,\\njust because he found out his wife was a witch? No,\\nHarry — I fashioned myself a new name, a name I\\nknew wizards everywhere would one day fear to\\nspeak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the\\nworld!”\\nHarry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared\\nnumbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had\\ngrown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so\\nmany others. ... At last he forced himself to speak.\\n“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.\\n“Not what?” snapped Riddle.\\n“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry,\\nbreathing fast. “Sorry to disappoint you and all that,\\nbut the greatest wizard in the world is Albus\\nDumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were\\nstrong, you didn’t dare try and take over at Hogwarts.\\nDumbledore saw through you when you were at\\nschool and he still frightens you now, wherever you’re\\nhiding these days — ”\\nThe smile had gone from Riddle’s face, to be replaced\\nby a very ugly look.\\n“Dumbledore ’s been driven out of this castle by the\\nmere memory of me!” he hissed.\\n \\n“He’s not as gone as you might think!” Harry retorted.\\nHe was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle,\\nwishing rather than believing it to be true —\\nRiddle opened his mouth, but froze.\\nMusic was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled\\naround to stare down the empty Chamber. The music\\nwas growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling,\\nunearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry’s scalp and made\\nhis heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its\\nnormal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch\\nthat Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames\\nerupted at the top of the nearest pillar.\\nA crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared,\\npiping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a\\nglittering golden tail as long as a peacock’s and\\ngleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged\\nbundle.\\nA second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It\\ndropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet,\\nthen landed heavily on his shoulder. As it folded its\\ngreat wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long,\\nsharp golden beak and a beady black eye.\\nThe bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to\\nHarry’s cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle.\\n“That’s a phoenix. ...” said Riddle, staring shrewdly\\nback at it.\\n“Fawkes?” Harry breathed, and he felt the bird’s\\ngolden claws squeeze his shoulder gently.\\n“And that — ” said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing\\nthat Fawkes had dropped, “that’s the old school\\nSorting Hat — ”\\n \\nSo it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay\\nmotionless at Harry’s feet.\\nRiddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that\\nthe dark Chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles\\nwere laughing at once —\\n“This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A\\nsongbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry\\nPotter? Do you feel safe now?”\\nHarry didn’t answer. He might not see what use\\nFawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer\\nalone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with\\nhis courage mounting.\\n“To business, Harry,” said Riddle, still smiling\\nbroadly. “Twice — in your past, in my future — we\\nhave met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you\\nsurvive ? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,” he\\nadded softly, “the longer you stay alive.”\\nHarry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle\\nhad the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting\\nHat, neither of which would be much good in a duel.\\nIt looked bad, all right . . . but the longer Riddle stood\\nthere, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny ... and\\nin the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle’s\\noutline was becoming clearer, more solid. ... If it had\\nto be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner\\nthan later.\\n“No one knows why you lost your powers when you\\nattacked me,” said Harry abruptly. “I don’t know\\nmyself. But I know why you couldn’t kill me. Because\\nmy mother died to save me. My common Muggle-born\\nmother,” he added, shaking with suppressed rage.\\n“She stopped you killing me. And I’ve seen the real\\nyou, I saw you last year. You’re a wreck. You’re barely\\n \\nalive. That’s where all your power got you. You’re in\\nhiding. You’re ugly, you’re foul — ”\\nRiddle’s face contorted. Then he forced it into an\\nawful smile.\\n“So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that’s a\\npowerful counter-charm. I can see now ... there is\\nnothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you\\nsee. There are strange likenesses between us, after\\nall. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods,\\norphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two\\nParselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great\\nSlytherin himself. We even look something alike ...\\nbut after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved\\nyou from me. That’s all I wanted to know.”\\nHarry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his\\nwand. But Riddle’s twisted smile was widening again.\\n“Now, Harry, I’m going to teach you a little lesson.\\nLet’s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of\\nSalazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and\\nthe best weapons Dumbledore can give him. ...”\\nHe cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting\\nHat, then walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his\\nnumb legs, watched Riddle stop between the high\\npillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin,\\nhigh above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened\\nhis mouth wide and hissed — but Harry understood\\nwhat he was saying. . . .\\n“ Speak to me, Slytherin , greatest of the Hogwarts\\nFour.”\\nHarry wheeled around to look up at the statue,\\nFawkes swaying on his shoulder.\\n \\nSlytherin’s gigantic stone face was moving.\\nHorrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider\\nand wider, to make a huge black hole.\\nAnd something was stirring inside the statue’s mouth.\\nSomething was slithering up from its depths.\\nHarry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber\\nwall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes’\\nwing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted\\nto shout, “Don’t leave me!” but what chance did a\\nphoenix have against the king of serpents?\\nSomething huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber.\\nHarry felt it shudder — he knew what was happening,\\nhe could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent\\nuncoiling itself from Slytherin’s mouth. Then he heard\\nRiddle’s hissing voice:\\n“Kill him.”\\nThe basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear\\nits heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty\\nfloor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run\\nblindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his\\nway — Voldemort was laughing —\\nHarry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted\\nblood — the serpent was barely feet from him, he\\ncould hear it coming —\\nThere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above\\nhim, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard\\nthat he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs\\nto sink through his body he heard more mad hissing,\\nsomething thrashing wildly off the pillars —\\nHe couldn’t help it — he opened his eyes wide enough\\nto squint at what was going on.\\n \\nThe enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick\\nas an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and\\nits great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between\\nthe pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes\\nif it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.\\nFawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk\\nwas snapping furiously at him with fangs long and\\nthin as sabers —\\nFawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight\\nand a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the\\nfloor. The snake’s tail thrashed, narrowly missing\\nHarry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned\\n— Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its\\neyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been\\npunctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the\\nfloor, and the snake was spitting in agony.\\n“NO!” Harry heard Riddle screaming. “LEAVE THE\\nBIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU!\\nYOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM! KILL HIM!”\\nThe blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly.\\nFawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song,\\njabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood\\npoured from its ruined eyes.\\n“Help me, help me,” Harry muttered wildly, “someone\\n— anyone — ”\\nThe snake’s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry\\nducked. Something soft hit his face.\\nThe basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry’s\\narms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only\\nchance — he rammed it onto his head and threw\\nhimself flat onto the floor as the basilisk’s tail swung\\nover him again.\\n \\nHelp me — help me — Harry thought, his eyes\\nscrewed tight under the hat. Please help me —\\nThere was no answering voice. Instead, the hat\\ncontracted, as though an invisible hand was\\nsqueezing it very tightly.\\nSomething very hard and heavy thudded onto the top\\nof Harry’s head, almost knocking him out. Stars\\nwinking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the\\nhat to pull it off and felt something long and hard\\nbeneath it.\\nA gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat,\\nits handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs.\\n“KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS\\nBEHIND YOU! SNIFF — SMELL HIM!”\\nHarry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk’s head was\\nfalling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it\\ntwisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye\\nsockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough\\nto swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his\\nsword, thin, glittering, venomous —\\nIt lunged blindly — Harry dodged and it hit the\\nChamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue\\nlashed Harry’s side. He raised the sword in both his\\nhands —\\nThe basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was\\ntrue — Harry threw his whole weight behind the\\nsword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the\\nserpent’s mouth —\\nBut as warm blood drenched Harry’s arms, he felt a\\nsearing pain just above his elbow. One long,\\npoisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into\\n \\nhis arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over\\nsideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.\\nHarry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that\\nwas spreading poison through his body and wrenched\\nit out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-\\nhot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the\\nwound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his\\nown blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy.\\nThe Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.\\nA patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft\\nclatter of claws beside him.\\n“Fawkes,” said Harry thickly. “You were fantastic,\\nFawkes. ...” He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on\\nthe spot where the serpent’s fang had pierced him.\\nHe could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark\\nshadow moved in front of him.\\n“You’re dead, Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s voice above\\nhim. “Dead. Even Dumbledore’s bird knows it. Do you\\nsee what he’s doing, Potter? He’s crying.”\\nHarry blinked. Fawkes’s head slid in and out of focus.\\nThick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy\\nfeathers.\\n“I’m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter.\\nTake your time. I’m in no hurry.”\\nHarry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to\\nbe spinning.\\n“So ends the famous Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s\\ndistant voice. “Alone in the Chamber of Secrets,\\nforsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark\\nLord he so unwisely challenged. You’ll be back with\\n \\nyour dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. ... She\\nbought you twelve years of borrowed time . . . but Lord\\nVoldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must.\\nIf this is dying, thought Harry, it’s not so bad.\\nEven the pain was leaving him. ...\\nBut was this dying? Instead of going black, the\\nChamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry\\ngave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes,\\nstill resting his head on Harry’s arm. A pearly patch\\nof tears was shining all around the wound — except\\nthat there was no wound —\\n“Get away, bird,” said Riddle’s voice suddenly. “Get\\naway from him — I said, get away — ”\\nHarry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry’s\\nwand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and\\nFawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.\\n“Phoenix tears ...” said Riddle quietly, staring at\\nHarry’s arm. “Of course ... healing powers ... I forgot\\nHe looked into Harry’s face. “But it makes no\\ndifference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and\\nme, Harry Potter ... you and me. ...”\\nHe raised the wand —\\nThen, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back\\noverhead and something fell into Harry’s lap — the\\ndiary.\\nFor a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still\\nraised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without\\n \\nconsidering, as though he had meant to do it all\\nalong, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next\\nto him and plunged it straight into the heart of the\\nbook.\\nThere was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink\\nspurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over\\nHarry’s hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing\\nand twisting, screaming and flailing and then —\\nHe had gone. Harry’s wand fell to the floor with a\\nclatter and there was silence. Silence except for the\\nsteady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The\\nbasilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right\\nthrough it.\\nShaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head\\nwas spinning as though he’d just traveled miles by\\nFloo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand\\nand the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved\\nthe glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk’s\\nmouth.\\nThen came a faint moan from the end of the\\nChamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried\\ntoward her, she sat up. Her bemused eyes traveled\\nfrom the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry,\\nin his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his\\nhand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears\\nbegan to pour down her face.\\n“Harry — oh, Harry — I tried to tell you at b-\\nbreakfast, but I c -couldn’t say it in front of Percy — it\\nwas me, Harry — but I — I s-swear I d-didn’t mean to\\n— R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over — and —\\nhow did you kill that — that thing? W-where’s Riddle?\\nThe last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the\\ndiary — ”\\n \\n“It’s all right,” said Harry, holding up the diary, and\\nshowing Ginny the fang hole, “Riddle’s finished. Look!\\nHim and the basilisk. C’mon, Ginny, let’s get out of\\nhere — ”\\n“I’m going to be expelled!” Ginny wept as Harry helped\\nher awkwardly to her feet. “I’ve looked forward to\\ncoming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now\\nI’ll have to leave and — w-what’ll Mum and Dad say?”\\nFawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the\\nChamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they\\nstepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk,\\nthrough the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.\\nHarry heard the stone doors close behind them with a\\nsoft hiss.\\nAfter a few minutes’ progress up the dark tunnel, a\\ndistant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry’s\\nears.\\n“Ron!” Harry yelled, speeding up. “Ginny’s okay! I’ve\\ngot her!”\\nHe heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned\\nthe next bend to see his eager face staring through\\nthe sizable gap he had managed to make in the\\nrockfall.\\n“Ginny\\\\” Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the\\nrock to pull her through first. “You’re alive! I don’t\\nbelieve it! What happened? How — what — where did\\nthat bird come from?”\\nFawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.\\n“He’s Dumbledore’s,” said Harry, squeezing through\\nhimself.\\n \\n“How come you’ve got a sword?” said Ron, gaping at\\nthe glittering weapon in Harry’s hand.\\n“I’ll explain when we get out of here,” said Harry with\\na sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder\\nthan ever.\\n“But — ”\\n“Later,” Harry said shortly. He didn’t think it was a\\ngood idea to tell Ron yet who’d been opening the\\nChamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway. “Where’s\\nLockhart?”\\n“Back there,” said Ron, still looking puzzled but\\njerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe. “He’s\\nin a bad way. Come and see.”\\nLed by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a\\nsoft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the\\nway back to the mouth of the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart\\nwas sitting there, humming placidly to himself.\\n“His memory’s gone,” said Ron. “The Memory Charm\\nbackfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn’t got a clue\\nwho he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to\\ncome and wait here. He’s a danger to himself.”\\nLockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.\\n“Hello,” he said. “Odd sort of place, this, isn’t it? Do\\nyou live here?”\\n“No,” said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.\\nHarry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.\\n“Have you thought how we’re going to get back up\\nthis?” he said to Ron.\\n \\nRon shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had\\nswooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of\\nhim, his beady eyes bright in the dark. He was waving\\nhis long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly\\nat him.\\n“He looks like he wants you to grab hold ...” said Ron,\\nlooking perplexed. “But you’re much too heavy for a\\nbird to pull up there — ”\\n“Fawkes,” said Harry, “isn’t an ordinary bird.” He\\nturned quickly to the others. “We’ve got to hold on to\\neach other. Ginny, grab Ron’s hand. Professor\\nLockhart — ”\\n“He means you,” said Ron sharply to Lockhart.\\n“You hold Ginny’s other hand — ”\\nHarry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his\\nbelt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry’s robes, and\\nHarry reached out and took hold of Fawkes’s\\nstrangely hot tail feathers.\\nAn extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through\\nhis whole body and the next second, in a rush of\\nwings, they were flying upward through the pipe.\\nHarry could hear Lockhart dangling below him,\\nsaying, “Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!”\\nThe chill air was whipping through Harry’s hair, and\\nbefore he’d stopped enjoying the ride, it was over —\\nall four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning\\nMyrtle’s bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his\\nhat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into\\nplace.\\nMyrtle goggled at them.\\n“You’re alive,” she said blankly to Harry.\\n \\n“There’s no need to sound so disappointed,” he said\\ngrimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his\\nglasses.\\n“Oh, well ... I’d just been thinking ... if you had died,\\nyou’d have been welcome to share my toilet,” said\\nMyrtle, blushing silver.\\n“Urgh!” said Ron as they left the bathroom for the\\ndark, deserted corridor outside. “Harry! I think\\nMyrtle’s grown fond of you! You’ve got competition,\\nGinny!”\\nBut tears were still flooding silently down Ginny’s\\nface.\\n“Where now?” said Ron, with an anxious look at\\nGinny. Harry pointed.\\nFawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the\\ncorridor. They strode after him, and moments later,\\nfound themselves outside Professor McGonagall’s\\noffice.\\nHarry knocked and pushed the door open.\\n \\nDOBBY’S REWARD\\nFor a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron,\\nGinny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in\\nmuck and slime and (in Harry’s case) blood. Then\\nthere was a scream.\\n“Ginny\\\\”\\nIt was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in\\nfront of the fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed\\nby Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on\\ntheir daughter.\\nHarry, however, was looking past them. Professor\\nDumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece,\\nbeaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was\\ntaking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest.\\nFawkes went whooshing past Harry’s ear and settled\\non Dumbledore ’s shoulder, just as Harry found\\nhimself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasley’s tight\\nembrace.\\n“You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?”\\n \\n“I think we’d all like to know that,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall weakly.\\nMrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a\\nmoment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon\\nit the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted sword, and\\nwhat remained of Riddle’s diary.\\nThen he started telling them everything. For nearly a\\nquarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He\\ntold them about hearing the disembodied voice, how\\nHermione had finally realized that he was hearing a\\nbasilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed\\nthe spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them\\nwhere the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he\\nhad guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the\\nvictim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of\\nSecrets might be in her bathroom. ...\\n“Very well,” Professor McGonagall prompted him as\\nhe paused, “so you found out where the entrance was\\n— breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along\\nthe way, I might add — but how on earth did you all\\nget out of there alive, Potter?”\\nSo Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this\\ntalking, told them about Fawkes’s timely arrival and\\nabout the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then\\nhe faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle’s\\ndiary — or Ginny. She was standing with her head\\nagainst Mrs. Weasley ’s shoulder, and tears were still\\ncoursing silently down her cheeks. What if they\\nexpelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle’s diary\\ndidn’t work anymore. ... How could they prove it had\\nbeen he who’d made her do it all?\\nInstinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who\\nsmiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon\\nspectacles.\\n \\n“What interests me most,” said Dumbledore gently, “is\\nhow Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny,\\nwhen my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in\\nthe forests of Albania.”\\nRelief — warm, sweeping, glorious relief — swept over\\nHarry.\\n“W-what’s that?” said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice.\\n“You-Know-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny ’s not\\n... Ginny hasn’t been ... has she?”\\n“It was this diary,” said Harry quickly, picking it up\\nand showing it to Dumbledore. “Riddle wrote it when\\nhe was sixteen. ...”\\nDumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered\\nkeenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and\\nsoggy pages.\\n“Brilliant,” he said softly. “Of course, he was probably\\nthe most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.”\\nHe turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking\\nutterly bewildered.\\n“Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once\\ncalled Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years\\nago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the\\nschool . . . traveled far and wide . . . sank so deeply into\\nthe Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our\\nkind, underwent so many dangerous, magical\\ntransformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord\\nVoldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone\\nconnected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome\\nboy who was once Head Boy here.”\\n“But, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What’s our Ginny\\ngot to do with — with — him?”\\n \\n“His d-diary!” Ginny sobbed. “I’ve b-been writing in it,\\nand he’s been w- writing back all year — ”\\n“Ginnyl” said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. “Haven’t I\\ntaught you anything ? What have I always told you?\\nNever trust anything that can think for itself if you\\ncan’t see where it keeps its brain. Why didn’t you\\nshow the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious\\nobject like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic — ”\\n“I d-didn’t know,” sobbed Ginny. “I found it inside one\\nof the books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had\\njust left it in there and forgotten about it — ”\\n“Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right\\naway,” Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. “This\\nhas been a terrible ordeal for her. There will be no\\npunishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have\\nbeen hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.” He strode over\\nto the door and opened it. “Bed rest and perhaps a\\nlarge, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find\\nthat cheers me up,” he added, twinkling kindly down\\nat her. “You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still\\nawake. She’s just giving out Mandrake juice — I\\ndaresay the basilisk’s victims will be waking up any\\nmoment.”\\n“So Hermione’s okay!” said Ron brightly.\\n“There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,” said\\nDumbledore.\\nMrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley\\nfollowed, still looking deeply shaken.\\n“You know, Minerva,” Professor Dumbledore said\\nthoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, “I think all this\\nmerits a good feast Might I ask you to go and alert\\nthe kitchens?”\\n \\n“Right,” said Professor McGonagall crisply, also\\nmoving to the door. “Ill leave you to deal with Potter\\nand Weasley, shall I?”\\n“Certainly,” said Dumbledore.\\nShe left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at\\nDumbledore. What exactly had Professor McGonagall\\nmeant, deal with them? Surely — surely — they\\nweren’t about to be punished?\\n“I seem to remember telling you both that I would\\nhave to expel you if you broke any more school rules,”\\nsaid Dumbledore.\\nRon opened his mouth in horror.\\n“Which goes to show that the best of us must\\nsometimes eat our words,” Dumbledore went on,\\nsmiling. “You will both receive Special Awards for\\nServices to the School and — let me see — yes, I think\\ntwo hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.”\\nRon went as brightly pink as Lockhart’s valentine\\nflowers and closed his mouth again.\\n“But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet\\nabout his part in this dangerous adventure,”\\nDumbledore added. “Why so modest, Gilderoy?”\\nHarry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about\\nLockhart. He turned and saw that Lockhart was\\nstanding in a corner of the room, still wearing his\\nvague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him,\\nLockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was\\ntalking to.\\n \\n“Professor Dumbledore,” Ron said quickly, “there was\\nan accident down in the Chamber of Secrets.\\nProfessor Lockhart — ”\\n“Am I a professor?” said Lockhart in mild surprise.\\n“Goodness. I expect I was hopeless, was I?”\\n“He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand\\nbackfired,” Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore.\\n“Dear me,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his\\nlong silver mustache quivering. “Impaled upon your\\nown sword, Gilderoy!”\\n“Sword?” said Lockhart dimly. “Haven’t got a sword.\\nThat boy has, though.” He pointed at Harry. “He’ll\\nlend you one.”\\n“Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the\\ninfirmary, too?” Dumbledore said to Ron. “I’d like a\\nfew more words with Harry. ...”\\nLockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at\\nDumbledore and Harry as he closed the door.\\nDumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.\\n“Sit down, Harry,” he said, and Harry sat, feeling\\nunaccountably nervous.\\n“First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,” said\\nDumbledore, eyes twinkling again. “You must have\\nshown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing\\nbut that could have called Fawkes to you.”\\nHe stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down\\nonto his knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as\\nDumbledore watched him.\\n \\n“And so you met Tom Riddle,” said Dumbledore\\nthoughtfully. “I imagine he was most interested in\\nyou. ...”\\nSuddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came\\ntumbling out of his mouth.\\n“Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I’m like him.\\nStrange likenesses, he said. ...”\\n“ Did he, now?” said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully\\nat Harry from under his thick silver eyebrows. “And\\nwhat do you think, Harry?”\\n“I don’t think I’m like him!” said Harry, more loudly\\nthan he’d intended. “I mean, I’m — I’m in Gryffindor,\\nI’m ...”\\nBut he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his\\nmind.\\n“Professor,” he started again after a moment. “The\\nSorting Hat told me I’d — I’d have done well in\\nSlytherin. Everyone thought / was Slytherin’s heir for\\na while ... because I can speak Parseltongue. ...”\\n“You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said\\nDumbledore calmly, “because Lord Voldemort — who\\nis the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin\\n— can speak Parseltongue. Unless I’m much\\nmistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to\\nyou the night he gave you that scar. Not something he\\nintended to do, I’m sure. ...”\\n“Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” Harry said,\\nthunderstruck.\\n“It certainly seems so.”\\n \\n“So I should be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking\\ndesperately into Dumbledore ’s face. “The Sorting Hat\\ncould see Slytherin ’s power in me, and it — ”\\n“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly.\\n“Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many\\nqualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked\\nstudents. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue —\\nresourcefulness — determination — a certain\\ndisregard for rules,” he added, his mustache\\nquivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in\\nGryffindor. You know why that was. Think.”\\n“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a\\ndefeated voice, “because I asked not to go in\\nSlytherin. ...”\\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, beaming once more.\\n“Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It\\nis our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far\\nmore than our abilities.” Harry sat motionless in his\\nchair, stunned. “If you want proof, Harry, that you\\nbelong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely\\nat this.”\\nDumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall’s\\ndesk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and\\nhanded it to Harry. Dully, Harry turned it over, the\\nrubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the\\nname engraved just below the hilt.\\nGodric Gryffindor.\\n“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of\\nthe hat, Harry,” said Dumbledore simply.\\nFor a minute, neither of them spoke. Then\\nDumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in\\n \\nProfessor McGonagall’s desk and took out a quill and\\na bottle of ink.\\n“What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I\\nsuggest you go down to the feast, while I write to\\nAzkaban — we need our gamekeeper back. And I\\nmust draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet,\\ntoo,” he added thoughtfully. “Well be needing a new\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher. ... Dear me,\\nwe do seem to run through them, don’t we?”\\nHarry got up and crossed to the door. He had just\\nreached for the handle, however, when the door burst\\nopen so violently that it bounced back off the wall.\\nLucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And\\ncowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in\\nbandages, was Dobby.\\n“Good evening, Lucius,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.\\nMr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept\\ninto the room. Dobby went scurrying in after him,\\ncrouching at the hem of his cloak, a look of abject\\nterror on his face.\\nThe elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was\\nattempting to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoy ’s shoes.\\nApparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a great hurry,\\nfor not only were his shoes half-polished, but his\\nusually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf\\nbobbing apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his\\ncold eyes upon Dumbledore.\\n“So!” he said “You’ve come back. The governors\\nsuspended you, but you still saw fit to return to\\nHogwarts.”\\n \\n“Well, you see, Lucius,” said Dumbledore, smiling\\nserenely, “the other eleven governors contacted me\\ntoday. It was something like being caught in a\\nhailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They’d heard that\\nArthur Weasley’s daughter had been killed and\\nwanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I\\nwas the best man for the job after all. Very strange\\ntales they told me, too. ... Several of them seemed to\\nthink that you had threatened to curse their families\\nif they didn’t agree to suspend me in the first place.”\\nMr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes\\nwere still slits of fury.\\n“So — have you stopped the attacks yet?” he sneered.\\n“Have you caught the culprit?”\\n“We have,” said Dumbledore, with a smile.\\n“Well?” said Mr. Malfoy sharply. “Who is it?”\\n“The same person as last time, Lucius,” said\\nDumbledore. “But this time, Lord Voldemort was\\nacting through somebody else. By means of this\\ndiary.”\\nHe held up the small black book with the large hole\\nthrough the center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely.\\nHarry, however, was watching Dobby.\\nThe elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes\\nfixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the\\ndiary, then at Mr. Malfoy, and then hitting himself\\nhard on the head with his fist.\\n“I see ...” said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.\\n“A clever plan,” said Dumbledore in a level voice, still\\nstaring Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. “Because if\\n \\nHarry here” — Mr. Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp\\nlook — “and his friend Ron hadn’t discovered this\\nbook, why — Ginny Weasley might have taken all the\\nblame. No one would ever have been able to prove she\\nhadn’t acted of her own free will. ...”\\nMr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly\\nmasklike.\\n“And imagine,” Dumbledore went on, “what might\\nhave happened then. ... The Weasleys are one of our\\nmost prominent pure-blood families. Imagine the\\neffect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection\\nAct, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and\\nkilling Muggle-borns. ... Very fortunate the diary was\\ndiscovered, and Riddle’s memories wiped from it. Who\\nknows what the consequences might have been\\notherwise. ...”\\nMr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.\\n“Very fortunate,” he said stiffly.\\nAnd still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first\\nto the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching\\nhimself in the head.\\nAnd Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at\\nDobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting\\nhis ears in punishment.\\n“Don’t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that\\ndiary, Mr. Malfoy?” said Harry.\\nLucius Malfoy rounded on him.\\n“How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold\\nof it?” he said.\\n \\n“Because you gave it to her,” said Harry. “In Flourish\\nand Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration\\nbook and slipped the diary inside it, didn’t you?”\\nHe saw Mr. Malfoy’s white hands clench and\\nunclench.\\n“Prove it,” he hissed.\\n“Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said Dumbledore,\\nsmiling at Harry. “Not now that Riddle has vanished\\nfrom the book. On the other hand, I would advise you,\\nLucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord\\nVoldemort’s old school things. If any more of them\\nfind their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur\\nWeasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back\\nto you. ...”\\nLucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry\\ndistinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was\\nlonging to reach for his wand. Instead, he turned to\\nhis house-elf.\\n“We’re going, Dobby!”\\nHe wrenched open the door and as the elf came\\nhurrying up to him, he kicked him right through it.\\nThey could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the\\nway along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment,\\nthinking hard. Then it came to him —\\n“Professor Dumbledore,” he said hurriedly. “Can I give\\nthat diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?”\\n“Certainly, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly. “But\\nhurry. The feast, remember. ...”\\nHarry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office.\\nHe could hear Dobby’s squeals of pain receding\\n \\naround the corner. Quickly, wondering if this plan\\ncould possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes,\\npulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary\\ninto it. Then he ran down the dark corridor.\\nHe caught up with them at the top of the stairs.\\n“Mr. Malfoy,” he gasped, skidding to a halt, “I’ve got\\nsomething for you — ”\\nAnd he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy’s\\nhand.\\n“What the — ?”\\nMr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it\\naside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to\\nHarry.\\n“You’ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one\\nof these days, Harry Potter,” he said softly. “They were\\nmeddlesome fools, too.”\\nHe turned to go.\\n“Come, Dobby. I said, come.”\\nBut Dobby didn’t move. He was holding up Harry’s\\ndisgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it\\nwere a priceless treasure.\\n“Master has given a sock,” said the elf in wonderment.\\n“Master gave it to Dobby.”\\n“What’s that?” spat Mr. Malfoy. “What did you say?”\\n“Got a sock,” said Dobby in disbelief. “Master threw it,\\nand Dobby caught it, and Dobby — Dobby is free.”\\n \\nLucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he\\nlunged at Harry.\\n“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!”\\nBut Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry\\nPotter!”\\nThere was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown\\nbackward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a\\ntime, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing\\nbelow. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his\\nwand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.\\n“You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at\\nMr. Malfoy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You\\nshall go now.”\\nLucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed\\nstare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around\\nhim and hurried out of sight.\\n“Harry Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing\\nup at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window\\nreflected in his orb-like eyes. “Harry Potter set Dobby\\nfree!”\\n“Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning. “Just\\npromise never to try and save my life again.”\\nThe elf’s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide,\\ntoothy smile.\\n“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said Harry as\\nDobby pulled on Harry’s sock with shaking hands.\\n“You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-\\nMust-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well — ”\\n \\n“It was a clue, sir,” said Dobby, his eyes widening, as\\nthough this was obvious. “Was giving you a clue. The\\nDark Lord, before he changed his name, could be\\nfreely named, you see?”\\n“Right,” said Harry weakly. “Well, I’d better go. There’s\\na feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by\\nnow. ...”\\nDobby threw his arms around Harry’s middle and\\nhugged him.\\n“Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!” he\\nsobbed. “Farewell, Harry Potter!”\\nAnd with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.\\nHarry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never\\none quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas,\\nand the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn’t know\\nwhether the best bit was Hermione running toward\\nhim, screaming “You solved it! You solved it!” or\\nJustin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to\\nwring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting\\nhim, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing\\nHarry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they\\nwere knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and\\nRon’s four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the\\nHouse Cup for the second year running, or Professor\\nMcGonagall standing up to tell them all that the\\nexams had been canceled as a school treat (“Oh, no!”\\nsaid Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that,\\nunfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to\\nreturn next year, owing to the fact that he needed to\\ngo away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the\\nteachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.\\n“Shame,” said Ron, helping himself to a jam\\ndoughnut. “He was starting to grow on me.”\\n \\nThe rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing\\nsunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a\\nfew, small differences — Defense Against the Dark\\nArts classes were canceled (“but we’ve had plenty of\\npractice at that anyway,” Ron told a disgruntled\\nHermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a\\nschool governor. Draco was no longer strutting\\naround the school as though he owned the place. On\\nthe contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the\\nother hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy\\nagain.\\nToo soon, it was time for the journey home on the\\nHogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred,\\nGeorge, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves.\\nThey made the most of the last few hours in which\\nthey were allowed to do magic before the holidays.\\nThey played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of\\nFred and George’s Filibuster fireworks, and practiced\\ndisarming each other by magic. Harry was getting\\nvery good at it.\\nThey were almost at King’s Cross when Harry\\nremembered something.\\n“Ginny — what did you see Percy doing, that he didn’t\\nwant you to tell anyone?”\\n“Oh, that,” said Ginny, giggling. “Well — Percy’s got a\\ngirlfriend.”\\nFred dropped a stack of books on George’s head.\\n“What?”\\n“It’s that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,”\\nsaid Ginny. “That’s who he was writing to all last\\nsummer. He’s been meeting her all over the school in\\nsecret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty\\n \\nclassroom one day. He was so upset when she was —\\nyou know — attacked. You won’t tease him, will you?”\\nshe added anxiously.\\n“Wouldn’t dream of it,” said Fred, who was looking\\nlike his birthday had come early.\\n“Definitely not,” said George, sniggering.\\nThe Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.\\nHarry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and\\nturned to Ron and Hermione.\\n“This is called a telephone number,” he told Ron,\\nscribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and\\nhanding it to them. “I told your dad how to use a\\ntelephone last summer — he’ll know. Call me at the\\nDursleys’, okay? I can’t stand another two months\\nwith only Dudley to talk to. ...”\\n“Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won’t\\nthey?” said Hermione as they got off the train and\\njoined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted\\nbarrier. “When they hear what you did this year?\\n“Proud?” said Harry. “Are you crazy? All those times I\\ncould’ve died, and I didn’t manage it? They’ll be\\nfurious. ...”\\nAnd together they walked back through the gateway\\nto the Muggle world.\\n \\n/\\nOWL POST\\nHarry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways.\\nFor one thing, he hated the summer holidays more\\nthan any other time of year. For another, he really\\nwanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in\\nsecret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to\\nbe a wizard.\\nIt was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his\\nstomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his\\nhead like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large\\nleather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda\\nBagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry\\nmoved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page,\\nfrowning as he looked for something that would help\\nhim write his essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth\\nCentury Was Completely Pointless — discuss.”\\nThe quill paused at the top of a likely-looking\\nparagraph. Harry pushed his round glasses up the\\nbridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the\\nbook, and read:\\n \\nNon-magic people (more commonly known as\\nMuggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval\\ntimes, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare\\noccasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard,\\nburning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard\\nwould perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and\\nthen pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a\\ngentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird\\nenjoyed being burned so much that she allowed\\nherself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in\\nvarious disguises.\\nHarry put his quill between his teeth and reached\\nunderneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of\\nparchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed\\nthe ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to\\nwrite, pausing every now and then to listen, because\\nif any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill\\non their way to the bathroom, he’d probably find\\nhimself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for\\nthe rest of the summer.\\nThe Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was\\nthe reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer\\nholidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son,\\nDudley, were Harry’s only living relatives. They were\\nMuggles, and they had a very medieval attitude\\ntoward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had been a\\nwitch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned\\nunder the Dursleys’ roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and\\nUncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as\\ndowntrodden as possible, they would be able to\\nsquash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had\\nbeen unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of\\nanyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the\\nlast two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\\nWizardry. The most they could do, however, was to\\nlock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and\\n \\nbroomstick at the start of the summer break, and\\nforbid him to talk to the neighbors.\\nThis separation from his spellbooks had been a real\\nproblem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts\\nhad given him a lot of holiday work. One of the\\nessays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking\\npotions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher,\\nProfessor Snape, who would be delighted to have an\\nexcuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had\\ntherefore seized his chance in the first week of the\\nholidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and\\nDudley had gone out into the front garden to admire\\nUncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices,\\nso that the rest of the street would notice it too),\\nHarry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the\\ncupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his\\nbooks, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as\\nhe didn’t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the\\nDursleys need never know that he was studying\\nmagic by night.\\nHarry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his\\naunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already\\nin an especially bad mood with him, all because he’d\\nreceived a telephone call from a fellow wizard one\\nweek into the school vacation.\\nRon Weasley, who was one of Harry’s best friends at\\nHogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. This\\nmeant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn’t, but\\nhad never used a telephone before. Most unluckily it\\nhad been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.\\n“Vernon Dursley speaking.”\\nHarry, who happened to be in the room at the time,\\nfroze as he heard Ron’s voice answer.\\n \\n“HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I — WANT —\\nTO — TALK — TO — HARRY — POTTER!”\\nRon was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped\\nand held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring\\nat it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm.\\n“WHO IS THIS?” he roared in the direction of the\\nmouthpiece. “WHO ARE YOU?”\\n“RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he\\nand Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends\\nof a football field. “I’M — A — FRIEND — OF —\\nHARRY’S — FROM — SCHOOL — ”\\nUncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry,\\nwho was rooted to the spot.\\n“THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared,\\nnow holding the receiver at arm’s length, as though\\nfrightened it might explode. “I DONT KNOW WHAT\\nSCHOOL YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER\\nCONTACT ME AGAIN! DONT YOU COME NEAR MY\\nFAMILY!”\\nAnd he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as\\nif dropping a poisonous spider.\\nThe fight that had followed had been one of the worst\\never.\\n“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE\\nLIKE — PEOPLE LIKE YOU!” Uncle Vernon had\\nroared, spraying Harry with spit.\\nRon obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into\\ntrouble, because he hadn’t called again. Harry’s other\\nbest friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn’t\\nbeen in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had\\n \\nwarned Hermione not to call, which was a pity,\\nbecause Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry’s\\nyear, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to\\nuse a telephone, and would probably have had\\nenough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.\\nSo Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding\\nfriends for five long weeks, and this summer was\\nturning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There\\nwas just one very small improvement — after\\nswearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to\\nany of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his\\nowl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in\\nbecause of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked\\nin her cage all the time.\\nHarry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and\\npaused to listen again. The silence in the dark house\\nwas broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his\\nenormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late, Harry\\nthought. His eyes were itching with tiredness.\\nPerhaps he’d finish this essay tomorrow night. ...\\nHe replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old\\npillowcase from under his bed; put the flashlight, A\\nHistory of Magic, his essay, quill, and ink inside it; got\\nout of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard\\nunder his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and\\nchecked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his\\nbedside table.\\nIt was one o’clock in the morning. Harry’s stomach\\ngave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years old,\\nwithout realizing it, for a whole hour.\\nYet another unusual thing about Harry was how little\\nhe looked forward to his birthdays. He had never\\nreceived a birthday card in his life. The Dursleys had\\n \\ncompletely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had\\nno reason to suppose they would remember this one.\\nHarry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig’s\\nlarge, empty cage, to the open window. He leaned on\\nthe sill, the cool night air pleasant on his face after a\\nlong time under the blankets. Hedwig had been\\nabsent for two nights now. Harry wasn’t worried\\nabout her: she’d been gone this long before. But he\\nhoped she’d be back soon — she was the only living\\ncreature in this house who didn’t flinch at the sight of\\nhim.\\nHarry, though still rather small and skinny for his\\nage, had grown a few inches over the last year. His\\njet-black hair, however, was just as it always had\\nbeen — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The\\neyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his\\nforehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin\\nscar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.\\nOf all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was\\nthe most extraordinary of all. It was not, as the\\nDursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of\\nthe car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, because\\nLily and James Potter had not died in a car crash.\\nThey had been murdered, murdered by the most\\nfeared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord\\nVoldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack\\nwith nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where\\nVoldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had\\nrebounded upon its originator. Barely alive,\\nVoldemort had fled. ...\\nBut Harry had come face-to-face with him at\\nHogwarts. Remembering their last meeting as he\\nstood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was\\nlucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.\\n \\nHe scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig,\\nperhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse\\ndangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing\\nabsently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before\\nHarry realized what he was seeing.\\nSilhouetted against the golden moon, and growing\\nlarger every moment, was a large, strangely lopsided\\ncreature, and it was flapping in Harry’s direction. He\\nstood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For\\na split second he hesitated, his hand on the window\\nlatch, wondering whether to slam it shut. But then\\nthe bizarre creature soared over one of the street\\nlamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it\\nwas, leapt aside.\\nThrough the window soared three owls, two of them\\nholding up the third, which appeared to be\\nunconscious. They landed with a soft flump on\\nHarry’s bed, and the middle owl, which was large and\\ngray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was\\na large package tied to its legs.\\nHarry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his\\nname was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley\\nfamily. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords\\naround Errol’s legs, took off the parcel, and then\\ncarried Errol to Hedwig’s cage. Errol opened one\\nbleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to\\ngulp some water.\\nHarry turned back to the remaining owls. One of\\nthem, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig.\\nShe, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely\\npleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate\\nnip with her beak as he removed her burden, then\\nflew across the room to join Errol.\\n \\nHarry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome\\ntawny one, but he knew at once where it had come\\nfrom, because in addition to a third package, it was\\ncarrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When\\nHarry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its\\nfeathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off\\nthrough the window into the night.\\nHarry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol’s\\npackage, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a\\npresent wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday\\ncard. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the\\nenvelope. Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a\\nnewspaper clipping.\\nThe clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding\\nnewspaper, the Daily Prophet, because the people in\\nthe black-and-white picture were moving. Harry\\npicked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:\\nMINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE\\nSCOOPS GRAND PRIZE\\nArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts\\nOffice at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual\\nDaily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.\\nA delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, “We\\nwill be spending the gold on a summer holiday in\\nEgypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse\\nbreaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank. ”\\nThe Weasley family will be spending a month in\\nEgypt, returning for the start of the new school year\\nat Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children\\ncurrently attend.\\n \\nHarry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin\\nspread across his face as he saw all nine of the\\nWeasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of\\na large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall,\\nbalding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all\\n(though the black-and-white picture didn’t show it)\\nwith flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of the\\npicture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat,\\nScabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his\\nlittle sister, Ginny.\\nHarry couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a\\nlarge pile of gold more than the Weasleys, who were\\nvery nice and extremely poor. He picked up Ron’s\\nletter and unfolded it.\\nDear Harry,\\nHappy birthday!\\nLook, I’m really sorry about that telephone call. I hope\\nthe Muggles didn’t give you a hard time. I asked Dad,\\nand he reckons I shouldn’t have shouted.\\nIt’s amazing here in Egypt. Bill’s taken us around all\\nthe tombs and you wouldn’t believe the curses those\\nold Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum wouldn’t let\\nGinny come in the last one. There were all these\\nmutant skeletons in there, of Muggles who’d broken in\\nand grown extra heads and stuff.\\nI couldn’t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet\\nDraw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it’s gone on\\nthis trip, but they’re going to buy me a new wand for\\nnext year.\\nHarry remembered only too well the occasion when\\nRon’s old wand had snapped. It had happened when\\n \\nthe car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts\\nhad crashed into a tree on the school grounds.\\nWe’ll be back about a week before term starts and\\nwe’ll be going up to London to get my wand and our\\nnew books. Any chance of meeting you there?\\nDon’t let the Muggles get you down!\\nTry and come to London,\\nRon\\nPS. Percy’s Head Boy. He got the letter last week.\\nHarry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who\\nwas in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, was\\nlooking particularly smug. He had pinned his Head\\nBoy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his\\nneat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the\\nEgyptian sun.\\nHarry now turned to his present and unwrapped it.\\nInside was what looked like a miniature glass\\nspinning top. There was another note from Ron\\nbeneath it.\\nHarry — this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there’s\\nsomeone untrustworthy around, it’s supposed to light\\nup and spin. Bill says it’s rubbish sold for wizard\\ntourists and isn’t reliable, because it kept lighting up at\\ndinner last night. But he didn’t realize Fred and George\\nhad put beetles in his soup.\\nBye —\\nRon\\n \\nHarry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside\\ntable, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point,\\nreflecting the luminous hands of his clock. He looked\\nat it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the\\nparcel Hedwig had brought.\\nInside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card,\\nand a letter, this time from Hermione.\\nDear Harry,\\nRon wrote to me and told me about his phone call to\\nyour Uncle Vernon. I do hope you’re all right.\\nI’m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn’t\\nknow how I was going to send this to you — what if\\nthey’d opened it at customs? — but then Hedwig\\nturned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got\\nsomething for your birthday for a change. I bought your\\npresent by owl-order; there was an advertisement in\\nthe Daily Prophet (I’ve been getting it delivered; it’s so\\ngood to keep up with what’s going on in the wizarding\\nworld). Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a\\nweek ago? I bet he’s learning loads. I’m really jealous\\n— the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating.\\nThere’s some interesting local history of witchcraft\\nhere, too. I’ve rewritten my whole History of Magic\\nessay to include some of the things I’ve found out. I\\nhope it’s not too long — it’s two rolls of parchment more\\nthan Professor Binns asked for.\\nRon says he’s going to be in London in the last week of\\nthe holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and\\nuncle let you come? I really hope you can. If not, I’ll see\\nyou on the Hogwarts Express on September first!\\nLove from\\n \\nHermione\\nPS. Ron says Percy’s Head Boy. I’ll bet Percy’s really\\npleased.\\nRon doesn’t seem too happy about it.\\nHarry laughed as he put Hermione ’s letter aside and\\npicked up her present. It was very heavy. Knowing\\nHermione, he was sure it would be a large book full of\\nvery difficult spells — but it wasn’t. His heart gave a\\nhuge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a\\nsleek black leather case, with silver words stamped\\nacross it, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit.\\n“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the\\ncase to look inside.\\nThere was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish\\nHandle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig\\nClippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom\\nfor long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself\\nBroomcare.\\nApart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed\\nmost about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most\\npopular sport in the magical world — highly\\ndangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks.\\nHarry happened to be a very good Quidditch player;\\nhe had been the youngest person in a century to be\\npicked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of\\nHarry’s most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two\\nThousand racing broom.\\nHarry put the leather case aside and picked up his\\nlast parcel. He recognized the untidy scrawl on the\\nbrown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the\\nHogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of\\npaper and glimpsed something green and leathery,\\n \\nbut before he could unwrap it properly, the parcel\\ngave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it\\nsnapped loudly — as though it had jaws.\\nHarry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send\\nhim anything dangerous on purpose, but then,\\nHagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of what\\nwas dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend\\ngiant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from\\nmen in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his\\ncabin.\\nHarry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly\\nagain. Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside\\ntable, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over\\nhis head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of\\nthe wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.\\nAnd out fell — a book. Harry just had time to register\\nits handsome green cover, emblazoned with the\\ngolden title The Monster Book of Monsters, before it\\nflipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the\\nbed like some weird crab.\\n“Uh-oh,” Harry muttered.\\nThe book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and\\nshuffled rapidly across the room. Harry followed it\\nstealthily. The book was hiding in the dark space\\nunder his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still\\nfast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees\\nand reached toward it.\\n“Ouch!”\\nThe book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped\\npast him, still scuttling on its covers. Harry\\nscrambled around, threw himself forward, and\\n \\nmanaged to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud,\\nsleepy grunt in the room next door.\\nHedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry\\nclamped the struggling book tightly in his arms,\\nhurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt,\\nwhich he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book\\nshuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap,\\nso Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for\\nHagrid’s card.\\nDear Harry,\\nHappy birthday!\\nThink you might find this useful for next year.\\nWon’t say no more here. Tell you when I see you.\\nHope the Muggles are treating you right.\\nAll the best,\\nHagrid\\nIt struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a\\nbiting book would come in useful, but he put Hagrid’s\\ncard up next to Ron’s and Hermione’s, grinning more\\nbroadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from\\nHogwarts left.\\nNoticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry\\nslit open the envelope, pulled out the first page of\\nparchment within, and read:\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\nPlease note that the new school year will begin on\\nSeptember the first. The Hogwarts Express will leave\\n \\nfrom King’s Cross station, platform nine and three-\\nquarters, at eleven o’clock.\\nThird years are permitted to visit the village of\\nHogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the\\nenclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to\\nsign.\\nA list of books for next year is enclosed.\\nYours sincerely,\\nProfessor M. McGonagall\\nDeputy Headmistress\\nHarry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and\\nlooked at it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful\\nto visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an\\nentirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot\\nthere. But how on earth was he going to persuade\\nUncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form?\\nHe looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two\\no’clock in the morning.\\nDeciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form\\nwhen he woke up, Harry got back into bed and\\nreached up to cross off another day on the chart he’d\\nmade for himself, counting down the days left until\\nhis return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses\\nand lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday\\ncards.\\nExtremely unusual though he was, at that moment\\nHarry Potter felt just like everyone else — glad, for the\\nfirst time in his life, that it was his birthday.\\n \\nAUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE\\nHarry went down to breakfast the next morning to\\nfind the three Dursleys already sitting around the\\nkitchen table. They were watching a brand-new\\ntelevision, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present\\nfor Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about\\nthe long walk between the fridge and the television in\\nthe living room. Dudley had spent most of the\\nsummer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on\\nthe screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate\\ncontinually.\\nHarry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a\\nlarge, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of\\nmustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday,\\nnone of the Dursleys made any sign that they had\\nnoticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too\\nused to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of\\ntoast and then looked up at the reporter on the\\ntelevision, who was halfway through a report on an\\nescaped convict:\\n \\n\"... The public is warned that Black is armed and\\nextremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set\\nup, and any sighting of Black should be reported\\nimmediately.”\\n“No need to tell us he’s no good,” snorted Uncle\\nVernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the\\nprisoner. “Look at the state of him, the filthy\\nlayabout! Look at his hair!”\\nHe shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy\\nhair had always been a source of great annoyance to\\nUncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the\\ntelevision, however, whose gaunt face was\\nsurrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry\\nfelt very well groomed indeed.\\nThe reporter had reappeared.\\n“The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will\\nannounce today — ”\\n“Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at\\nthe reporter. “You didn’t tell us where that maniac’s\\nescaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be\\ncoming up the street right now!”\\nAunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced,\\nwhipped around and peered intently out of the\\nkitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would\\nsimply love to be the one to call the hot line number.\\nShe was the nosiest woman in the world and spent\\nmost of her life spying on the boring, law-abiding\\nneighbors.\\n“When will they learn,” said Uncle Vernon, pounding\\nthe table with his large purple fist, “that hanging’s the\\nonly way to deal with these people?”\\n \\n“Very true,” said Aunt Petunia, who was still\\nsquinting into next door’s runner beans.\\nUncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his\\nwatch, and added, “I’d better be off in a minute,\\nPetunia. Marge’s train gets in at ten.”\\nHarry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the\\nBroomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth\\nwith an unpleasant bump.\\n“Aunt Marge?” he blurted out. “Sh — she’s not\\ncoming here, is she?”\\nAunt Marge was Uncle Vernon’s sister. Even though\\nshe was not a blood relative of Harry’s (whose mother\\nhad been Aunt Petunia’s sister), he had been forced to\\ncall her “Aunt” all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the\\ncountry, in a house with a large garden, where she\\nbred bulldogs. She didn’t often stay at Privet Drive,\\nbecause she couldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs,\\nbut each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in\\nHarry’s mind.\\nAt Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had\\nwhacked Harry around the shins with her walking\\nstick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical\\nstatues. A few years later, she had turned up at\\nChristmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and\\na box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the\\nyear before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had\\naccidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog.\\nRipper had chased Harry out into the garden and up\\na tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off\\nuntil past midnight. The memory of this incident still\\nbrought tears of laughter to Dudley’s eyes.\\n“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled,\\n“and while we’re on the subject” — he pointed a fat\\n \\nfinger threateningly at Harry — “we need to get a few\\nthings straight before I go and collect her.”\\nDudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the\\ntelevision. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle\\nVernon was Dudley’s favorite form of entertainment.\\n“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil\\ntongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.”\\n“All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s\\ntalking to me.”\\n“Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he\\nhad not heard Harry’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know\\nanything about your abnormality, I don’t want any —\\nany funny stuff while she’s here. You behave yourself,\\ngot me?”\\n“I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth.\\n“And thirdly,” said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes\\nnow slits in his great purple face, “we’ve told Marge\\nyou attend St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably\\nCriminal Boys.”\\n“What?” Harry yelled.\\n“And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be\\ntrouble,” spat Uncle Vernon.\\nHarry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at\\nUncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge\\ncoming for a week-long visit — it was the worst\\nbirthday present the Dursleys had ever given him,\\nincluding that pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks.\\n \\n“Well, Petunia,” said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to\\nhis feet, “111 be off to the station, then. Want to come\\nalong for the ride, Dudders?”\\n“No,” said Dudley, whose attention had returned to\\nthe television now that Uncle Vernon had finished\\nthreatening Harry.\\n“Duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie,”\\nsaid Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley’s thick blond\\nhair. “Mummy’s bought him a lovely new bow tie.”\\nUncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder.\\n“See you in a bit, then,” he said, and he left the\\nkitchen.\\nHarry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified\\ntrance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he\\ngot quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to\\nthe front door.\\nUncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.\\n“I’m not taking you,” he snarled as he turned to see\\nHarry watching him.\\n“Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly. “I want to\\nask you something.”\\nUncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.\\n“Third years at Hog — at my school are allowed to\\nvisit the village sometimes,” said Harry.\\n“So?” snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from\\na hook next to the door.\\n \\n“I need you to sign the permission form,” said Harry\\nin a rush.\\n“And why should I do that?” sneered Uncle Vernon.\\n“Well,” said Harry, choosing his words carefully, “it’ll\\nbe hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that\\nSt. Whatsits — ”\\n“St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal\\nBoys!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased\\nto hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon’s\\nvoice.\\n“Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle\\nVernon’s large, purple face. “It’s a lot to remember. I’ll\\nhave to make it sound convincing, won’t I? What if I\\naccidentally let something slip?”\\n“ You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you?”\\nroared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist\\nraised. But Harry stood his ground.\\n“Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt\\nMarge forget what I could tell her,” he said grimly.\\nUncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an\\nugly puce.\\n“But if you sign my permission form,” Harry went on\\nquickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to\\ngo to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal\\nand everything.”\\nHarry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it\\nover, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was\\nthrobbing in his temple.\\n \\n“Right,” he snapped finally. “I shall monitor your\\nbehavior carefully during Marge’s visit. If, at the end\\nof it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, I’ll\\nsign your ruddy form.”\\nHe wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and\\nslammed it so hard that one of the little panes of\\nglass at the top fell out.\\nHarry didn’t return to the kitchen. He went back\\nupstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a\\nreal Muggle, he’d better start now. Slowly and sadly\\nhe gathered up all his presents and his birthday\\ncards and hid them under the loose floorboard with\\nhis homework. Then he went to Hedwig’s cage. Errol\\nseemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both\\nasleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then\\npoked them both awake.\\n“Hedwig,” he said gloomily, “you’re going to have to\\nclear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron’ll look after\\nyou. I’ll write him a note, explaining. And don’t look at\\nme like that” — Hedwig’s large amber eyes were\\nreproachful — “it’s not my fault. It’s the only way I’ll\\nbe allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and\\nHermione.”\\nTen minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note\\nto Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window\\nand out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly\\nmiserable, put the empty cage away inside the\\nwardrobe.\\nBut Harry didn’t have long to brood. In next to no\\ntime, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for\\nHarry to come down and get ready to welcome their\\nguest.\\n \\n“Do something about your hair!” Aunt Petunia\\nsnapped as he reached the hall.\\nHarry couldn’t see the point of trying to make his hair\\nlie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the\\nuntidier he looked, the happier she would be.\\nAll too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as\\nUncle Vernon’s car pulled back into the driveway,\\nthen the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the\\ngarden path.\\n“Get the door!” Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.\\nA feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled\\nthe door open.\\nOn the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like\\nUncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple-faced, she\\neven had a mustache, though not as bushy as his. In\\none hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked\\nunder the other was an old and evil-tempered\\nbulldog.\\n“Where’s my Dudders?” roared Aunt Marge. “Where’s\\nmy neffy-poo?”\\nDudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair\\nplastered flat to his fat head, a bow tie just visible\\nunder his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the\\nsuitcase into Harry’s stomach, knocking the wind out\\nof him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and\\nplanted a large kiss on his cheek.\\nHarry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up\\nwith Aunt Marge’s hugs because he was well paid for\\nit, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley\\nhad a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.\\n \\n“Petunia!” shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as\\nthough he was a hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt\\nPetunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her\\nlarge jaw against Aunt Petunia’s bony cheekbone.\\nUncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut\\nthe door.\\n“Tea, Marge?” he said. “And what will Ripper take?”\\n“Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,” said\\nAunt Marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen,\\nleaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase. But\\nHarry wasn’t complaining; any excuse not to be with\\nAunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the\\ncase upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long\\nas he could.\\nBy the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge\\nhad been supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper\\nwas lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt\\nPetunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool\\nflecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.\\n“Who’s looking after the other dogs, Marge?” Uncle\\nVernon asked.\\n“Oh, I’ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,”\\nboomed Aunt Marge. “He’s retired now, good for him\\nto have something to do. But I couldn’t leave poor old\\nRipper. He pines if he’s away from me.”\\nRipper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This\\ndirected Aunt Marge’s attention to Harry for the first\\ntime.\\n“So!” she barked. “Still here, are you?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\n \\n“Don’t you say ‘yes’ in that ungrateful tone,” Aunt\\nMarge growled. “It’s damn good of Vernon and\\nPetunia to keep you. Wouldn’t have done it myself.\\nYou’d have gone straight to an orphanage if you’d\\nbeen dumped on my doorstep.”\\nHarry was bursting to say that he’d rather live in an\\norphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of\\nthe Hogsmeade form stopped him. He forced his face\\ninto a painful smile.\\n“Don’t you smirk at me!” boomed Aunt Marge. “I can\\nsee you haven’t improved since I last saw you. I hoped\\nschool would knock some manners into you.” She\\ntook a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and\\nsaid, “Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?”\\n“St. Brutus’s,” said Uncle Vernon promptly. “It’s a\\nfirst-rate institution for hopeless cases.”\\n“I see,” said Aunt Marge. “Do they use the cane at St.\\nBrutus’s, boy?” she barked across the table.\\n“Er — ”\\nUncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge’s\\nback.\\n“Yes,” said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do\\nthe thing properly, he added, “all the time.”\\n“Excellent,” said Aunt Marge. “I won’t have this\\nnamby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not\\nhitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing is\\nwhat’s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred.\\nHave you been beaten often?”\\n“Oh, yeah,” said Harry, “loads of times.”\\n \\nAunt Marge narrowed her eyes.\\n“I still don’t like your tone, boy,” she said. “If you can\\nspeak of your beatings in that casual way, they\\nclearly aren’t hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I’d\\nwrite if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the\\nuse of extreme force in this boy’s case.”\\nPerhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might\\nforget their bargain; in any case, he changed the\\nsubject abruptly.\\n“Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about\\nthat escaped prisoner, eh?”\\nAs Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry\\ncaught himself thinking almost longingly of life at\\nnumber four without her. Uncle Vernon and Aunt\\nPetunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their\\nway, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt\\nMarge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her\\neye at all times, so that she could boom out\\nsuggestions for his improvement. She delighted in\\ncomparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge\\npleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while\\nglaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he\\nhadn’t got a present too. She also kept throwing out\\ndark hints about what made Harry such an\\nunsatisfactory person.\\n“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s\\nturned out, Vernon,” she said over lunch on the third\\nday. “If there’s something rotten on the inside, there’s\\nnothing anyone can do about it.”\\nHarry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands\\nshook and his face was starting to burn with anger.\\nRemember the form, he told himself. Think about\\nHogsmeade. Don’t say anything. Don’t rise —\\n \\nAunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.\\n“It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said. “You\\nsee it all the time with dogs. If there’s something\\nwrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong\\nwith the pup — ”\\nAt that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was\\nholding exploded in her hand. Shards of glass flew in\\nevery direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and\\nblinked, her great ruddy face dripping.\\n“Marge!” squealed Aunt Petunia. “Marge, are you all\\nright?”\\n“Not to worry,” grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face\\nwith her napkin. “Must have squeezed it too hard. Did\\nthe same thing at Colonel Fubster’s the other day. No\\nneed to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip ...”\\nBut Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both\\nlooking at Harry suspiciously, so he decided he’d\\nbetter skip dessert and escape from the table as soon\\nas he could.\\nOutside in the hall, he leaned against the wall,\\nbreathing deeply. It had been a long time since he’d\\nlost control and made something explode. He couldn’t\\nafford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form\\nwasn’t the only thing at stake — if he carried on like\\nthat, he’d be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic.\\nHarry was still an underage wizard, and he was\\nforbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school.\\nHis record wasn’t exactly clean either. Only last\\nsummer he’d gotten an official warning that had\\nstated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of\\nany more magic in Privet Drive, Harry would face\\nexpulsion from Hogwarts.\\n \\nHe heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried\\nupstairs out of the way.\\nHarry got through the next three days by forcing\\nhimself to think about his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself\\nBroomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him. This\\nworked quite well, though it seemed to give him a\\nglazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the\\nopinion that he was mentally subnormal.\\nAt last, at long last, the final evening of Marge’s stay\\narrived. Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and\\nUncle Vernon uncorked several bottles of wine. They\\ngot all the way through the soup and the salmon\\nwithout a single mention of Harry’s faults; during the\\nlemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them all\\nwith a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making\\ncompany; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle\\nVernon brought out a bottle of brandy.\\n“Can I tempt you, Marge?”\\nAunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her\\nhuge face was very red.\\n“Just a small one, then,” she chuckled. “A bit more\\nthan that ... and a bit more ... that’s the ticket.”\\nDudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt\\nPetunia was sipping coffee with her little finger\\nsticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear into his\\nbedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon’s angry little eyes\\nand knew he would have to sit it out.\\n“Aah,” said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and\\nputting the empty brandy glass back down. “Excellent\\nnosh, Petunia. It’s normally just a fry-up for me of an\\nevening, with twelve dogs to look after. ...” She\\nburped richly and patted her great tweed stomach.\\n \\n“Pardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-sized boy,”\\nshe went on, winking at Dudley. “You’ll be a proper-\\nsized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I’ll have a\\nspot more brandy, Vernon. ...”\\n“Now, this one here — ”\\nShe jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach\\nclench. The Handbook, he thought quickly.\\n“This one’s got a mean, runty look about him. You get\\nthat with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last\\nyear. Ratty little thing it was. Weak. Underbred.”\\nHarry was trying to remember page twelve of his\\nbook: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers.\\n“It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other\\nday. Bad blood will out. Now, I’m saying nothing\\nagainst your family, Petunia” — she patted Aunt\\nPetunia’s bony hand with her shovellike one — “but\\nyour sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best\\nfamilies. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here’s\\nthe result right in front of us.”\\nHarry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his\\nears. Grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he thought.\\nBut he couldn’t remember what came next. Aunt\\nMarge’s voice seemed to be boring into him like one of\\nUncle Vernon’s drills.\\n“This Potter,” said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the\\nbrandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and\\nover the tablecloth, “you never told me what he did?”\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking\\nextremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his\\npie to gape at his parents.\\n \\n“He — didn’t work,” said Uncle Vernon, with half a\\nglance at Harry. “Unemployed.”\\n“As I expected!” said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig\\nof brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. “A no-\\naccount, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who — ”\\n“He was not,” said Harry suddenly. The table went\\nvery quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He had never\\nfelt so angry in his life.\\n“MORE BRANDY!” yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone\\nvery white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge’s\\nglass. “You, boy,” he snarled at Harry. “Go to bed, go\\non — ”\\n“No, Vernon,” hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a\\nhand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry’s. “Go\\non, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They\\ngo and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I\\nexpect) — ”\\n“They didn’t die in a car crash!” said Harry, who\\nfound himself on his feet.\\n“They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left\\nyou to be a burden on their decent, hardworking\\nrelatives!” screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury.\\n“You are an insolent, ungrateful little — ”\\nBut Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a\\nmoment, it looked as though words had failed her.\\nShe seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger —\\nbut the swelling didn’t stop. Her great red face started\\nto expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth\\nstretched too tightly for speech — next second,\\nseveral buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket\\nand pinged off the walls — she was inflating like a\\nmonstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her\\n \\ntweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a\\nsalami —\\n“MARGE!” yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia\\ntogether as Aunt Marge’s whole body began to rise off\\nher chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round,\\nnow, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her\\nhands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up\\ninto the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper\\ncame skidding into the room, barking madly.\\n“NOOOOOOO!”\\nUncle Vernon seized one of Marge’s feet and tried to\\npull her down again, but was almost lifted from the\\nfloor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and\\nsank his teeth into Uncle Vernon’s leg.\\nHarry tore from the dining room before anyone could\\nstop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs.\\nThe cupboard door burst magically open as he\\nreached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the\\nfront door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself\\nunder the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard,\\nand grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and\\nbirthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig’s\\nempty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his\\ntrunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining\\nroom, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.\\n“COME BACK IN HERE!” he bellowed. “COME BACK\\nAND PUT HER RIGHT!”\\nBut a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked\\nhis trunk open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at\\nUncle Vernon.\\n“She deserved it,” Harry said, breathing very fast.\\n“She deserved what she got. You keep away from me.”\\n \\nHe fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.\\n“I’m going,” Harry said. “I’ve had enough.”\\nAnd in the next moment, he was out in the dark,\\nquiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him,\\nHedwig’s cage under his arm.\\n \\n3\\nTHE KNIGHT BUS\\nHarry was several streets away before he collapsed\\nonto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from\\nthe effort of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still,\\nanger still surging through him, listening to the\\nfrantic thumping of his heart.\\nBut after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new\\nemotion overtook him: panic. Whichever way he\\nlooked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. He was\\nstranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with\\nabsolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he\\nhad just done serious magic, which meant that he\\nwas almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had\\nbroken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage\\nWizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic\\nrepresentatives weren’t swooping down on him where\\nhe sat.\\nHarry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia\\nCrescent. What was going to happen to him? Would\\nhe be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from\\nthe wizarding world? He thought of Ron and\\n \\nHermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was\\nsure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would\\nwant to help him now, but they were both abroad,\\nand with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting\\nthem.\\nHe didn’t have any Muggle money, either. There was a\\nlittle wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of\\nhis trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had\\nleft him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding\\nBank in London. He’d never be able to drag his trunk\\nall the way to London. Unless ...\\nHe looked down at his wand, which he was still\\nclutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his\\nheart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit more\\nmagic couldn’t hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he\\nhad inherited from his father — what if he bewitched\\nthe trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his\\nbroomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to\\nLondon? Then he could get the rest of his money out\\nof his vault and ... begin his life as an outcast. It was\\na horrible prospect, but he couldn’t sit on this wall\\nforever, or he’d find himself trying to explain to\\nMuggle police why he was out in the dead of night\\nwith a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.\\nHarry opened his trunk again and pushed the\\ncontents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak —\\nbut before he had found it, he straightened up\\nsuddenly, looking around him once more.\\nA funny prickling on the back of his neck had made\\nHarry feel he was being watched, but the street\\nappeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from\\nany of the large square houses.\\nHe bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately\\nstood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand.\\n \\nHe had sensed rather than heard it: someone or\\nsomething was standing in the narrow gap between\\nthe garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted\\nat the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he’d\\nknow whether it was just a stray cat or — something\\nelse.\\n“Lumos,” Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the\\nend of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high\\nover his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number\\ntwo suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and\\nbetween them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking\\noutline of something very big, with wide, gleaming\\neyes.\\nHarry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and\\nhe tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung\\nout an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in\\nthe gutter —\\nThere was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his\\nhands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding\\nlight —\\nWith a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in\\ntime. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and\\nheadlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry\\nhad just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw\\nwhen he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently\\npurple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold\\nlettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus.\\nFor a split second, Harry wondered if he had been\\nknocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple\\nuniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak\\nloudly to the night.\\n“Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for\\nthe stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your\\n \\nwand hand, step on board, and we can take you\\nanywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike,\\nand I will be your conductor this eve — ”\\nThe conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught\\nsight of Harry, who was still sitting on the ground.\\nHarry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to\\nhis feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was\\nonly a few years older than he was, eighteen or\\nnineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and\\nquite a few pimples.\\n“What were you doin’ down there?” said Stan,\\ndropping his professional manner.\\n“Fell over,” said Harry.\\n“ ’Choo fall over for?” sniggered Stan.\\n“I didn’t do it on purpose,” said Harry, annoyed. One\\nof the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he\\nhad thrown out to break his fall was bleeding. He\\nsuddenly remembered why he had fallen over and\\nturned around quickly to stare at the alleyway\\nbetween the garage and fence. The Knight Bus’s\\nheadlamps were flooding it with light, and it was\\nempty.\\n“ ’Choo lookin’ at?” said Stan.\\n“There was a big black thing,” said Harry, pointing\\nuncertainly into the gap. “Like a dog ... but massive\\nHe looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly\\nopen. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan’s eyes\\nmove to the scar on Harry’s forehead.\\n“Woss that on your ’ead?” said Stan abruptly.\\n \\n“Nothing,” said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over\\nhis scar. If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him,\\nhe didn’t want to make it too easy for them.\\n“Woss your name?” Stan persisted.\\n“Neville Longbottom,” said Harry, saying the first\\nname that came into his head. “So — so this bus,” he\\nwent on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, “did you say\\nit goes anywhere?”\\n“Yep,” said Stan proudly, “anywhere you like, long’s\\nit’s on land. Can’t do nuffink underwater. ’Ere,” he\\nsaid, looking suspicious again, “you did flag us down,\\ndincha? Stuck out your wand ’and, dincha?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry quickly. “Listen, how much would it\\nbe to get to London?”\\n“Eleven Sickles,” said Stan, “but for firteen you get ’ot\\nchocolate, and for fifteen you get an ’ot water bottle\\nan’ a toofbrush in the color of your choice.”\\nHarry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted\\nhis money bag, and shoved some gold into Stan’s\\nhand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with\\nHedwig’s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the\\nbus.\\nThere were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass\\nbedsteads stood beside the curtained windows.\\nCandles were burning in brackets beside each bed,\\nilluminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in\\na nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, “Not now,\\nthanks, I’m pickling some slugs” and rolled over in his\\nsleep.\\n“You ’ave this one,” Stan whispered, shoving Harry’s\\ntrunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was\\n \\nsitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel.\\n“This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This is Neville\\nLongbottom, Ern.”\\nErnie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick\\nglasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his\\nbangs again and sat down on his bed.\\n“Take ’er away, Ern,” said Stan, sitting down in the\\narmchair next to Ernie’s.\\nThere was another tremendous BANG, and the next\\nmoment Harry found himself flat on his bed, thrown\\nbackward by the speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling\\nhimself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and\\nsaw that they were now bowling along a completely\\ndifferent street. Stan was watching Harry’s stunned\\nface with great enjoyment.\\n“This is where we was before you flagged us down,” he\\nsaid. “Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?”\\n“Ar,” said Ernie.\\n“How come the Muggles don’t hear the bus?” said\\nHarry.\\n“Them!” said Stan contemptuously. “Don’ listen\\nproperly, do they? Don’ look properly either. Never\\nnotice nuffink, they don’.”\\n“Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,” said Ern.\\n“Well be in Abergavenny in a minute.”\\nStan passed Harry’s bed and disappeared up a\\nnarrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out\\nof the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie\\ndidn’t seem to have mastered the use of a steering\\nwheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement,\\n \\nbut it didn’t hit anything; lines of lampposts,\\nmailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it\\napproached and back into position once it had\\npassed.\\nStan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly\\ngreen witch wrapped in a traveling cloak.\\n“ ’Ere you go, Madam Marsh,” said Stan happily as\\nErn stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or\\nso toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh\\nclamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered\\ndown the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and\\nrammed the doors shut; there was another loud\\nBANG, and they were thundering down a narrow\\ncountry lane, trees leaping out of the way.\\nHarry wouldn’t have been able to sleep even if he had\\nbeen traveling on a bus that didn’t keep banging\\nloudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His\\nstomach churned as he fell back to wondering what\\nwas going to happen to him, and whether the\\nDursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the\\nceiling yet.\\nStan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and\\nwas now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A\\nlarge photograph of a sunken-faced man with long,\\nmatted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front\\npage. He looked strangely familiar.\\n“That man!” Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a\\nmoment. “He was on the Muggle news!”\\nStanley turned to the front page and chuckled.\\n“Sirius Black,” he said, nodding. “ ’Course ’e was on\\nthe Muggle news, Neville, where you been?”\\n \\nHe gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look\\non Harry’s face, removed the front page, and handed\\nit to Harry.\\n“You oughta read the papers more, Neville.”\\nHarry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:\\nBLACK STILL AT LARGE\\nSirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner\\never to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding\\ncapture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.\\n“We are doing all we can to recapture Black,” said the\\nMinister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning,\\n“and we beg the magical community to remain calm.”\\nFudge has been criticized by some members of the\\nInternational Federation of Warlocks for informing the\\nMuggle Prime Minister of the crisis.\\n“Well, really, I had to, don’t you know,” said an\\nirritable Fudge. “Black is mad. He’s a danger to\\nanyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the\\nPrime Minister’s assurance that he will not breathe a\\nword of Black’s true identity to anyone. And let’s face\\nit — who’d believe him if he did?”\\nWhile Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a\\ngun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill\\neach other), the magical community lives in fear of a\\nmassacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black\\nmurdered thirteen people with a single curse.\\nHarry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black,\\nthe only part of the sunken face that seemed alive.\\n \\nHarry had never met a vampire, but he had seen\\npictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts\\nclasses, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked\\njust like one.\\n“Scary-lookin’ fing, inee?” said Stan, who had been\\nwatching Harry read.\\n“He murdered thirteen people?” said Harry, handing\\nthe page back to Stan, “with one curse?”\\n“Yep,” said Stan, “in front of witnesses an’ all. Broad\\ndaylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?”\\n“Ar,” said Ern darkly.\\nStan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back,\\nthe better to look at Harry.\\n“Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-’Oo,” he said.\\n“What, Voldemort?” said Harry, without thinking.\\nEven Stan’s pimples went white; Ern jerked the\\nsteering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to\\njump aside to avoid the bus.\\n“You outta your tree?” yelped Stan. “ ’Choo say ’is\\nname for?”\\n“Sorry,” said Harry hastily. “Sorry, I — I forgot — ”\\n“Forgot!” said Stan weakly. “Blimey, my ’eart’s goin’\\nthat fast...”\\n“So — so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?”\\nHarry prompted apologetically.\\n \\n“Yeah,” said Stan, still rubbing his chest. “Yeah,\\nthat’s right. Very close to You-Know-’Oo, they say.\\nAnyway, when little ’Arry Potter got the better of You-\\nKnow-’Oo — ”\\nHarry nervously flattened his bangs down again.\\n“ — all You-Know-’Oo’s supporters was tracked down,\\nwasn’t they, Ern? Most of ’em knew it was all over,\\nwiv You-Know-’Oo gone, and they came quiet. But not\\nSirius Black. I ’eard he thought ’e’d be second-in-\\ncommand once You-Know-’Oo ’ad taken over.\\n“Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street\\nfull of Muggles an’ Black took out ’is wand and ’e\\nblasted ’alf the street apart, an’ a wizard got it, an’ so\\ndid a dozen Muggles what got in the way. ’Orrible, eh?\\nAn’ you know what Black did then?” Stan continued\\nin a dramatic whisper.\\n“What?” said Harry.\\n“Laughed,” said Stan. “Jus’ stood there an’ laughed.\\nAn’ when reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic\\ngot there, ’e went wiv ’em quiet as anyfink, still\\nlaughing ’is ’ead off. ’Cos ’e’s mad, inee, Ern? Inee\\nmad?”\\n“If he weren’t when he went to Azkaban, he will be\\nnow,” said Ern in his slow voice. “I’d blow meself up\\nbefore I set foot in that place. Serves him right, mind\\nyou ... after what he did. ...”\\n“They ’ad a job coverin’ it up, din’ they, Ern?” Stan\\nsaid. “ ’Ole street blown up an’ all them Muggles\\ndead. What was it they said ’ad ’appened, Ern?”\\n“Gas explosion,” grunted Ernie.\\n \\n“An’ now ’e’s out,” said Stan, examining the\\nnewspaper picture of Black’s gaunt face again. “Never\\nbeen a breakout from Azkaban before, ’as there, Ern?\\nBeats me ’ow ’e did it. Frightenin’, eh? Mind, I don’t\\nfancy ’is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh,\\nErn?”\\nErnie suddenly shivered.\\n“Talk about summat else, Stan, there’s a good lad.\\nThem Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.”\\nStan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry\\nleaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling\\nworse than ever. He couldn’t help imagining what\\nStan might be telling his passengers in a few nights’\\ntime.\\n“ ’Ear about that ’Arry Potter? Blew up ’is aunt! We\\n’ad ’im ’ere on the Knight Bus, di’n’t we, Ern? ’E was\\ntryin’ to run for it. ...”\\nHe, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius\\nBlack. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land\\nhim in Azkaban? Harry didn’t know anything about\\nthe wizard prison, though everyone he’d ever heard\\nspeak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the\\nHogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there\\nonly last year. Harry wouldn’t soon forget the look of\\nterror on Hagrid ’s face when he had been told where\\nhe was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest\\npeople Harry knew.\\nThe Knight Bus rolled through the darkness,\\nscattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone\\nbooths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and\\nmiserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan\\nremembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate,\\nbut poured it all over Harry’s pillow when the bus\\n \\nmoved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen. One by\\none, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and\\nslippers descended from the upper floors to leave the\\nbus. They all looked very pleased to go.\\nFinally, Harry was the only passenger left.\\n“Right then, Neville,” said Stan, clapping his hands,\\n“whereabouts in London?”\\n“Diagon Alley,” said Harry.\\n“Righto,” said Stan. “ ’Old tight, then ...”\\nBANG!\\nThey were thundering along Charing Cross Road.\\nHarry sat up and watched buildings and benches\\nsqueezing themselves out of the Knight Bus’s way.\\nThe sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low\\nfor a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the moment it\\nopened, then set off — where, he didn’t know.\\nErn slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus\\nskidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby-\\nlooking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay\\nthe magical entrance to Diagon Alley.\\n“Thanks,” Harry said to Ern.\\nHe jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his\\ntrunk and Hedwig’s cage onto the pavement.\\n“Well,” said Harry. “ ’Bye then!”\\nBut Stan wasn’t paying attention. Still standing in the\\ndoorway to the bus, he was goggling at the shadowy\\nentrance to the Leaky Cauldron.\\n \\n“ There you are, Harry,” said a voice.\\nBefore Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his\\nshoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, “Blimey!\\nErn, come ’ere! Come ’ere!”\\nHarry looked up at the owner of the hand on his\\nshoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his\\nstomach — he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge,\\nthe Minister of Magic himself.\\nStan leapt onto the pavement beside them.\\n“What didja call Neville, Minister?” he said excitedly.\\nFudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak,\\nlooked cold and exhausted.\\n“Neville?” he repeated, frowning. “This is Harry\\nPotter.”\\n“I knew it!” Stan shouted gleefully. “Ern! Ern! Guess\\n’oo Neville is, Ern! ’E’s ’Arry Potter! I can see ’is scar!”\\n“Yes,” said Fudge testily, “well, I’m very glad the\\nKnight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to\\nstep inside the Leaky Cauldron now ...”\\nFudge increased the pressure on Harry’s shoulder,\\nand Harry found himself being steered inside the pub.\\nA stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through\\nthe door behind the bar. It was Tom, the wizened,\\ntoothless landlord.\\n“You’ve got him, Minister!” said Tom. “Will you be\\nwanting anything? Beer? Brandy?”\\n“Perhaps a pot of tea,” said Fudge, who still hadn’t let\\ngo of Harry.\\n \\nThere was a loud scraping and puffing from behind\\nthem, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry’s\\ntrunk and Hedwig’s cage and looking around\\nexcitedly.\\n“ ’Ow come you di’n’t tell us ’oo you are, eh, Neville?”\\nsaid Stan, beaming at Harry, while Ernie’s owlish face\\npeered interestedly over Stan’s shoulder.\\n“And a private parlor, please, Tom,” said Fudge\\npointedly.\\n“ ’Bye,” Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom\\nbeckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the\\nbar.\\n“ ’Bye, Neville!” called Stan.\\nFudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after\\nTom’s lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom\\nclicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate,\\nand he bowed himself out of the room.\\n“Sit down, Harry,” said Fudge, indicating a chair by\\nthe fire.\\nHarry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his\\narms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his\\npinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up\\nthe trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down\\nopposite Harry.\\n“I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.”\\nHarry already knew this, of course; he had seen\\nFudge once before, but as he had been wearing his\\nfather’s Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn’t to\\nknow that.\\n \\nTom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over\\nhis nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets.\\nHe placed the tray on a table between Fudge and\\nHarry and left the parlor, closing the door behind\\nhim.\\n“Well, Harry,” said Fudge, pouring out tea, “you’ve\\nhad us all in a right flap, I don’t mind telling you.\\nRunning away from your aunt and uncle’s house like\\nthat! I’d started to think ... but you’re safe, and that’s\\nwhat matters.”\\nFudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the\\nplate toward Harry.\\n“Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then ...\\nYou will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with\\nthe unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley.\\nTwo members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad\\nwere dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss\\nDursley has been punctured and her memory has\\nbeen modified. She has no recollection of the incident\\nat all. So that’s that, and no harm done.”\\nFudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup,\\nrather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew.\\nHarry, who couldn’t believe his ears, opened his\\nmouth to speak, couldn’t think of anything to say,\\nand closed it again.\\n“Ah, you’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt\\nand uncle?” said Fudge. “Well, I won’t deny that they\\nare extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to\\ntake you back next summer as long as you stay at\\nHogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.”\\nHarry unstuck his throat.\\n \\n“I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and\\nEaster holidays,” he said, “and I don’t ever want to go\\nback to Privet Drive.”\\n“Now, now, I’m sure you’ll feel differently once you’ve\\ncalmed down,” said Fudge in a worried tone. “They\\nare your family, after all, and I’m sure you are fond of\\neach other — er — very deep down.”\\nIt didn’t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was\\nstill waiting to hear what was going to happen to him\\nnow.\\n“So all that remains,” said Fudge, now buttering\\nhimself a second crumpet, “is to decide where you’re\\ngoing to spend the last three weeks of your vacation. I\\nsuggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron\\nand — ”\\n“Hang on,” blurted Harry. “What about my\\npunishment?”\\nFudge blinked.\\n“Punishment?”\\n“I broke the law!” Harry said. “The Decree for the\\nRestriction of Underage Wizardry!”\\n“Oh, my dear boy, we’re not going to punish you for a\\nlittle thing like that!” cried Fudge, waving his crumpet\\nimpatiently. “It was an accident! We don’t send people\\nto Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!”\\nBut this didn’t tally at all with Harry’s past dealings\\nwith the Ministry of Magic.\\n“Last year, I got an official warning just because a\\nhouse-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle’s house!”\\n \\nhe told Fudge, frowning. “The Ministry of Magic said\\nI’d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more\\nmagic there!”\\nUnless Harry’s eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was\\nsuddenly looking awkward.\\n“Circumstances change, Harry. ... We have to take\\ninto account ... in the present climate . . . Surely you\\ndon’t want to be expelled?”\\n“Of course I don’t,” said Harry.\\n“Well then, what’s all the fuss about?” laughed Fudge.\\n“Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if\\nTom’s got a room for you.”\\nFudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after\\nhim. There was something extremely odd going on.\\nWhy had Fudge been waiting for him at the Leaky\\nCauldron, if not to punish him for what he’d done?\\nAnd now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn’t\\nusual for the Minister of Magic himself to get involved\\nin matters of underage magic?\\nFudge came back, accompanied by Tom the\\ninnkeeper.\\n“Room eleven’s free, Harry,” said Fudge. “I think you’ll\\nbe very comfortable. Just one thing, and I’m sure\\nyou’ll understand ... I don’t want you wandering off\\ninto Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon Alley.\\nAnd you’re to be back here before dark each night.\\nSure you’ll understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on\\nyou for me.”\\n“Okay,” said Harry slowly, “but why — ?”\\n \\n“Don’t want to lose you again, do we?” said Fudge\\nwith a hearty laugh. “No, no ... best we know where\\nyou are. ... I mean ...”\\nFudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his\\npinstriped cloak.\\n“Well, I’ll be off, plenty to do, you know. ...”\\n“Have you had any luck with Black yet?” Harry asked.\\nFudge’s finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his\\ncloak.\\n“What’s that? Oh, you’ve heard — well, no, not yet,\\nbut it’s only a matter of time. The Azkaban guards\\nhave never yet failed ... and they are angrier than I’ve\\never seen them.”\\nFudge shuddered slightly.\\n“So, I’ll say good-bye.”\\nHe held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a\\nsudden idea.\\n“Er — Minister? Can I ask you something?”\\n“Certainly,” said Fudge with a smile.\\n“Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit\\nHogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn’t sign the\\npermission form. D’you think you could — ?”\\nFudge was looking uncomfortable.\\n“Ah,” he said. “No, no, I’m very sorry, Harry, but as\\nI’m not your parent or guardian — ”\\n \\n“But you’re the Minister of Magic,” said Harry eagerly.\\n“If you gave me permission — ”\\n“No, I’m sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,” said Fudge\\nflatly. “Perhaps you’ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next\\nyear. In fact, I think it’s best if you don’t ... yes ...\\nwell, I’ll be off. Enjoy your stay, Harry.”\\nAnd with a last smile and shake of Harry’s hand,\\nFudge left the room. Tom now moved forward,\\nbeaming at Harry.\\n“If you’ll follow me, Mr. Potter,” he said, “I’ve already\\ntaken your things up. ...”\\nHarry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase\\nto a door with a brass number eleven on it, which\\nTom unlocked and opened for him.\\nInside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some\\nhighly polished oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling\\nfire and, perched on top of the wardrobe —\\n“Hedwig!” Harry gasped.\\nThe snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down\\nonto Harry’s arm.\\n“Very smart owl you’ve got there,” chuckled Tom.\\n“Arrived about five minutes after you did. If there’s\\nanything you need, Mr. Potter, don’t hesitate to ask.”\\nHe gave another bow and left.\\nHarry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly\\nstroking Hedwig. The sky outside the window was\\nchanging rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold,\\nsteely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold.\\nHarry could hardly believe that he’d left Privet Drive\\n \\nonly a few hours ago, that he wasn’t expelled, and\\nthat he was now facing three Dursley-free weeks.\\n“It’s been a very weird night, Hedwig,” he yawned.\\nAnd without even removing his glasses, he slumped\\nback onto his pillows and fell asleep.\\n \\nTHE LEAKY CAULDRON\\nIt took Harry several days to get used to his strange\\nnew freedom. Never before had he been able to get up\\nwhenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied. He\\ncould even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was\\nin Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was\\npacked with the most fascinating wizarding shops in\\nthe world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to\\nFudge and stray back into the Muggle world.\\nHarry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky\\nCauldron, where he liked watching the other guests:\\nfunny little witches from the country, up for a day’s\\nshopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the\\nlatest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking\\nwarlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked\\nsuspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw\\nliver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.\\nAfter breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard,\\ntake out his wand, tap the third brick from the left\\nabove the trash bin, and stand back as the archway\\ninto Diagon Alley opened in the wall.\\n \\nHarry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops\\nand eating under the brightly colored umbrellas\\noutside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing\\none another their purchases (“it’s a lunascope, old\\nboy — no more messing around with moon charts,\\nsee?”) or else discussing the case of Sirius Black\\n(“personally, I won’t let any of the children out alone\\nuntil he’s back in Azkaban”). Harry didn’t have to do\\nhis homework under the blankets by flashlight\\nanymore; now he could sit in the bright sunshine\\noutside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor,\\nfinishing all his essays with occasional help from\\nFlorean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a\\ngreat deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry\\nfree sundaes every half an hour.\\nOnce Harry had refilled his money bag with gold\\nGalleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his\\nvault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a lot of self-\\ncontrol not to spend the whole lot at once. He had to\\nkeep reminding himself that he had five years to go at\\nHogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys\\nfor money for spellbooks, to stop himself from buying\\na handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding\\ngame rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a\\nnasty-smelling liquid into the other player’s face when\\nthey lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the\\nperfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass\\nball, which would have meant he never had to take\\nanother Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested\\nHarry’s resolution most appeared in his favorite shop,\\nQuality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he’d arrived\\nat the Leaky Cauldron.\\nCurious to know what the crowd in the shop was\\nstaring at, Harry edged his way inside and squeezed\\nin among the excited witches and wizards until he\\nglimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was\\n \\nmounted the most magnificent broom he had ever\\nseen in his life.\\n“Just come out — prototype — ” a square-jawed\\nwizard was telling his companion.\\n“It’s the fastest broom in the world, isn’t it, Dad?”\\nsqueaked a boy younger than Harry, who was\\nswinging off his father’s arm.\\n“Irish International Side’s just put in an order for\\nseven of these beauties!” the proprietor of the shop\\ntold the crowd. “And they’re favorites for the World\\nCup!”\\nA large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was\\nable to read the sign next to the broom:\\nTHE FIREBOLT\\nThis state-of-the-art racing broom sports a stream-\\nlined, superfine handle of ash, treated with a\\ndiamond-hard polish and hand-numbered with its\\nown registration number. Each individually selected\\nbirch twig in the broomtail has been honed to\\naerodynamic perfection, giving the Firebolt\\nunsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision. The\\nFirebolt has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in\\nten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable\\nBraking Charm. Price on request.\\nPrice on request ... Harry didn’t like to think how\\nmuch gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never\\nwanted anything as much in his whole life — but he\\nhad never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two\\nThousand, and what was the point in emptying his\\nGringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very\\ngood broom already? Harry didn’t ask for the price,\\n \\nbut he returned, almost every day after that, just to\\nlook at the Firebolt.\\nThere were, however, things that Harry needed to\\nbuy. He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store\\nof potions ingredients, and as his school robes were\\nnow several inches too short in the arm and leg, he\\nvisited Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions and\\nbought new ones. Most important of all, he had to\\nbuy his new schoolbooks, which would include those\\nfor his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures\\nand Divination.\\nHarry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop\\nwindow. Instead of the usual display of gold-\\nembossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there\\nwas a large iron cage behind the glass that held about\\na hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters.\\nTorn pages were flying everywhere as the books\\ngrappled with each other, locked together in furious\\nwrestling matches and snapping aggressively.\\nHarry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and\\nconsulted it for the first time. The Monster Book of\\nMonsters was listed as the required book for Care of\\nMagical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid\\nhad said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he\\nhad been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with\\nsome terrifying new pet.\\nAs Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager\\ncame hurrying toward him.\\n“Hogwarts?” he said abruptly. “Come to get your new\\nbooks?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry, “I need — ”\\n \\n“Get out of the way,” said the manager impatiently,\\nbrushing Harry aside. He drew on a pair of very thick\\ngloves, picked up a large, knobbly walking stick, and\\nproceeded toward the door of the Monster Books’ cage.\\n“Hang on,” said Harry quickly, “I’ve already got one of\\nthose.”\\n“Have you?” A look of enormous relief spread over the\\nmanager’s face. “Thank heavens for that. I’ve been\\nbitten five times already this morning — ”\\nA loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster\\nBooks had seized a third and were pulling it apart.\\n“Stop it! Stop it!” cried the manager, poking the\\nwalking stick through the bars and knocking the\\nbooks apart. “I’m never stocking them again, never!\\nIt’s been bedlam! I thought we’d seen the worst when\\nwe bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of\\nInvisibility — cost a fortune, and we never found\\nthem. ... Well ... is there anything else I can help you\\nwith?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry, looking down his booklist, “I need\\nUnfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.”\\n“Ah, starting Divination, are you?” said the manager,\\nstripping off his gloves and leading Harry into the\\nback of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to\\nfortune-telling. A small table was stacked with\\nvolumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate\\nYourself Against Shocks and Broken Balls: When\\nFortunes Turn Foul.\\n“Here you are,” said the manager, who had climbed a\\nset of steps to take down a thick, black-bound book.\\n“Unfogging the Future. Very good guide to all your\\n \\nbasic fortune-telling methods — palmistry, crystal\\nballs, bird entrails — ”\\nBut Harry wasn’t listening. His eyes had fallen on\\nanother book, which was among a display on a small\\ntable: Death Omens: What to Do When You Know the\\nWorst Is Coming.\\n“Oh, I wouldn’t read that if I were you,” said the\\nmanager lightly, looking to see what Harry was\\nstaring at. “You’ll start seeing death omens\\neverywhere. It’s enough to frighten anyone to death.”\\nBut Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the\\nbook; it showed a black dog large as a bear, with\\ngleaming eyes. It looked oddly familiar. ...\\nThe manager pressed Unfogging the Future into\\nHarry’s hands.\\n“Anything else?” he said.\\n“Yes,” said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the\\ndog’s and dazedly consulting his booklist. “Er — I\\nneed Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard\\nBook of Spells, Grade Three.”\\nHarry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes\\nlater with his new books under his arms and made\\nhis way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing\\nwhere he was going and bumping into several people.\\nHe tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside,\\nand tipped his books onto his bed. Somebody had\\nbeen in to tidy; the windows were open and sun was\\npouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by\\nin the unseen Muggle street behind him and the\\nsound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley. He\\ncaught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin.\\n \\n“It can’t have been a death omen,” he told his\\nreflection defiantly. “I was panicking when I saw that\\nthing in Magnolia Crescent. ... It was probably just a\\nstray dog. ...”\\nHe raised his hand automatically and tried to make\\nhis hair lie flat.\\n“You’re fighting a losing battle there, dear,” said his\\nmirror in a wheezy voice.\\nAs the days slipped by, Harry started looking\\nwherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione.\\nPlenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon\\nAlley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met\\nSeamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow\\nGryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where\\nthey too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the\\nreal Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy,\\noutside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn’t stop to chat;\\nNeville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was\\nbeing told off by his very formidable-looking\\ngrandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that\\nhe’d pretended to be Neville while on the run from the\\nMinistry of Magic.\\nHarry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking\\nthat he would at least meet Ron and Hermione\\ntomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got up,\\ndressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was\\njust wondering where he’d have lunch, when someone\\nyelled his name and he turned.\\n“Harry! HARRY!”\\nThey were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean\\nFortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor — Ron looking\\nincredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving\\nfrantically at him.\\n \\n“Finally!” said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down.\\n“We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you’d\\nleft, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam\\nMalkin’s, and — ”\\n“I got all my school stuff last week,” Harry explained.\\n“And how come you knew I’m staying at the Leaky\\nCauldron?”\\n“Dad,” said Ron simply.\\nMr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic,\\nwould of course have heard the whole story of what\\nhad happened to Aunt Marge.\\n“Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?” said\\nHermione in a very serious voice.\\n“I didn’t mean to,” said Harry while Ron roared with\\nlaughter. “I just — lost control.”\\n“It’s not funny, Ron,” said Hermione sharply.\\n“Honestly, I’m amazed Harry wasn’t expelled.”\\n“So am I,” admitted Harry. “Forget expelled, I thought\\nI was going to be arrested.” He looked at Ron. “Your\\ndad doesn’t know why Fudge let me off, does he?”\\n“Probably ’cause it’s you, isn’t it?” shrugged Ron, still\\nchuckling. “Famous Harry Potter and all that. I’d hate\\nto see what the Ministry’d do to me if I blew up an\\naunt. Mind you, they’d have to dig me up first,\\nbecause Mum would’ve killed me. Anyway, you can\\nask Dad yourself this evening. We’re staying at the\\nLeaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to\\nKing’s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione’s there as\\nwell!”\\n \\nHermione nodded, beaming. “Mum and Dad dropped\\nme off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.”\\n“Excellent!” said Harry happily. “So, have you got all\\nyour new books and stuff?”\\n“Look at this,” said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of\\na bag and opening it. “Brand-new wand. Fourteen\\ninches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And\\nwe’ve got all our books — ” He pointed at a large bag\\nunder his chair. “What about those Monster Books,\\neh? The assistant nearly cried when we said we\\nwanted two.”\\n“What’s all that, Hermione?” Harry asked, pointing at\\nnot one but three bulging bags in the chair next to\\nher.\\n“Well, I’m taking more new subjects than you, aren’t\\nI?” said Hermione. “Those are my books for\\nArithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination,\\nStudy of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies — ”\\n“What are you doing Muggle Studies for?” said Ron,\\nrolling his eyes at Harry. “You’re Muggle-born! Your\\nmum and dad are Muggles! You already know all\\nabout Muggles!”\\n“But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the\\nwizarding point of view,” said Hermione earnestly.\\n“Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year,\\nHermione?” asked Harry, while Ron sniggered.\\nHermione ignored them.\\n“I’ve still got ten Galleons,” she said, checking her\\npurse. “It’s my birthday in September, and Mum and\\nDad gave me some money to get myself an early\\nbirthday present.”\\n \\n“How about a nice book?” said Ron innocently.\\n“No, I don’t think so,” said Hermione composedly. “I\\nreally want an owl. I mean, Harry’s got Hedwig and\\nyou’ve got Errol — ”\\n“I haven’t,” said Ron. “Errol’s a family owl. All I’ve got\\nis Scabbers.” He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket.\\n“And I want to get him checked over,” he added,\\nplacing Scabbers on the table in front of them. “I\\ndon’t think Egypt agreed with him.”\\nScabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there\\nwas a definite droop to his whiskers.\\n“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said\\nHarry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now. “You\\ncould see if they’ve got anything for Scabbers, and\\nHermione can get her owl.”\\nSo they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street\\nto the Magical Menagerie.\\nThere wasn’t much room inside. Every inch of wall\\nwas hidden by cages. It was smelly and very noisy\\nbecause the occupants of these cages were all\\nsqueaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The\\nwitch behind the counter was already advising a\\nwizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.\\nA pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly\\nand feasting on dead blowflies. A gigantic tortoise\\nwith a jewel-encrusted shell was glittering near the\\nwindow. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly\\nup the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit\\nkept changing into a silk top hat and back again with\\na loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every\\ncolor, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny\\n \\ncustard-colored furballs that were humming loudly,\\nand on the counter, a vast cage of sleek black rats\\nthat were playing some sort of skipping game using\\ntheir long, bald tails.\\nThe double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron\\napproached the counter.\\n“It’s my rat,” he told the witch. “He been a bit off-color\\never since I brought him back from Egypt.”\\n“Bang him on the counter,” said the witch, pulling a\\npair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket.\\nRon lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and\\nplaced him next to the cage of his fellow rats, who\\nstopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire\\nfor a better look.\\nLike nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat\\nwas secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron’s\\nbrother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the glossy\\nrats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.\\n“Hm,” said the witch, picking up Scabbers. “How old\\nis this rat?”\\n“Dunno,” said Ron. “Quite old. He used to belong to\\nmy brother.”\\n“What powers does he have?” said the witch,\\nexamining Scabbers closely.\\n“Er — ” The truth was that Scabbers had never shown\\nthe faintest trace of interesting powers. The witch’s\\neyes moved from Scabbers ’s tattered left ear to his\\nfront paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted\\nloudly.\\n \\n“He’s been through the mill, this one,” she said.\\n“He was like that when Percy gave him to me,” said\\nRon defensively.\\n“An ordinary common or garden rat like this can’t be\\nexpected to live longer than three years or so,” said\\nthe witch. “Now, if you were looking for something a\\nbit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these — ”\\nShe indicated the black rats, who promptly started\\nskipping again. Ron muttered, “Show-offs.”\\n“Well, if you don’t want a replacement, you can try\\nthis rat tonic,” said the witch, reaching under the\\ncounter and bringing out a small red bottle.\\n“Okay,” said Ron. “How much — OUCH!”\\nRon buckled as something huge and orange came\\nsoaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on\\nhis head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at\\nScabbers.\\n“NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!” cried the witch, but\\nScabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of\\nsoap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then\\nscampered for the door.\\n“Scabbers!” Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after\\nhim; Harry followed.\\nIt took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers,\\nwho had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside\\nQuality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling\\nrat back into his pocket and straightened up,\\nmassaging his head.\\n“What was that?”\\n \\n“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,”\\nsaid Harry.\\n“Where’s Hermione?”\\n“Probably getting her owl — ”\\nThey made their way back up the crowded street to\\nthe Magical Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione\\ncame out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her arms\\nwere clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.\\n“You bought that monster?” said Ron, his mouth\\nhanging open.\\n“He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.\\nThat was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The\\ncat’s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was\\ndefinitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy\\nand oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong\\ninto a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight,\\nhowever, the cat was purring contentedly in\\nHermione ’s arms.\\n“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.\\n“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said\\nHermione.\\n“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the\\nlump in his chest pocket. “He needs rest and\\nrelaxation! How’s he going to get it with that thing\\naround?”\\n“That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,” said\\nHermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron’s\\nhand. “And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be\\nsleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours,\\n \\nwhat’s the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch\\nsaid he’d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.”\\n“I wonder why,” said Ron sarcastically as they set off\\ntoward the Leaky Cauldron.\\nThey found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the\\nDaily Prophet.\\n“Harry!” he said, smiling as he looked up. “How are\\nyou?”\\n“Fine, thanks,” said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione\\njoined Mr. Weasley with all their shopping.\\nMr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the\\nnow familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him.\\n“They still haven’t caught him, then?” he asked.\\n“No,” said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave.\\n“They’ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the\\nMinistry to try and find him, but no luck so far.”\\n“Would we get a reward if we caught him?” asked\\nRon. “It’d be good to get some more money — ”\\n“Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” said Mr. Weasley, who on\\ncloser inspection looked very strained. “Black’s not\\ngoing to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It’s\\nthe Azkaban guards who’ll get him back, you mark\\nmy words.”\\nAt that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden\\nwith shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred\\nand George, who were about to start their fifth year at\\nHogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the\\nWeasleys’ youngest child and only girl, Ginny.\\n \\nGinny, who had always been very taken with Harry,\\nseemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual\\nwhen she saw him, perhaps because he had saved\\nher life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She\\nwent very red and muttered “hello” without looking at\\nhim. Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as\\nthough he and Harry had never met and said, “Harry.\\nHow nice to see you.”\\n“Hello, Percy,” said Harry, trying not to laugh.\\n“I hope you’re well?” said Percy pompously, shaking\\nhands. It was rather like being introduced to the\\nmayor.\\n“Very well, thanks — ”\\n“Harry!” said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and\\nbowing deeply. “Simply splendid to see you, old boy —\\n“Marvelous,” said George, pushing Fred aside and\\nseizing Harry’s hand in turn. “Absolutely spiffing.”\\nPercy scowled.\\n“That’s enough, now,” said Mrs. Weasley.\\n“Mum!” said Fred as though he’d only just spotted her\\nand seizing her hand too. “How really corking to see\\nyou — ”\\n“I said, that’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley, depositing\\nher shopping in an empty chair. “Hello, Harry, dear. I\\nsuppose you’ve heard our exciting news?” She pointed\\nto the brand-new silver badge on Percy’s chest.\\n“Second Head Boy in the family!” she said, swelling\\nwith pride.\\n \\n“And last,” Fred muttered under his breath.\\n“I don’t doubt that,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning\\nsuddenly. “I notice they haven’t made you two\\nprefects.”\\n“What do we want to be prefects for?” said George,\\nlooking revolted at the very idea. “It’d take all the fun\\nout of life.”\\nGinny giggled.\\n“You want to set a better example for your sister!”\\nsnapped Mrs. Weasley.\\n“Ginny’s got other brothers to set her an example,\\nMother,” said Percy loftily. “I’m going up to change for\\ndinner. ...”\\nHe disappeared and George heaved a sigh.\\n“We tried to shut him in a pyramid,” he told Harry.\\n“But Mum spotted us.”\\nDinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the\\ninnkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and\\nthe seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their\\nway through five delicious courses.\\n“How’re we getting to King’s Cross tomorrow, Dad?”\\nasked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate\\npudding.\\n“The Ministry’s providing a couple of cars,” said Mr.\\nWeasley.\\nEveryone looked up at him.\\n“Why?” said Percy curiously.\\n \\n“It’s because of you, Perce,” said George seriously.\\n“And there’ll be little flags on the hoods, with HB on\\nthem — ”\\n“ — for Humongous Bighead,” said Fred.\\nEveryone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into\\ntheir pudding.\\n“Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?” Percy\\nasked again, in a dignified voice.\\n“Well, as we haven’t got one anymore,” said Mr.\\nWeasley, “ — and as I work there, they’re doing me a\\nfavor — ”\\nHis voice was casual, but Harry couldn’t help noticing\\nthat Mr. Weasley’s ears had gone red, just like Ron’s\\ndid when he was under pressure.\\n“Good thing, too,” said Mrs. Weasley briskly. “Do you\\nrealize how much luggage you’ve all got between you?\\nA nice sight you’d be on the Muggle Underground. ...\\nYou are all packed, aren’t you?”\\n“Ron hasn’t put all his new things in his trunk yet,”\\nsaid Percy, in a long-suffering voice. “He’s dumped\\nthem on my bed.”\\n“You’d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we\\nwon’t have much time in the morning,” Mrs. Weasley\\ncalled down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.\\nAfter dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by\\none they made their way upstairs to their rooms to\\ncheck their things for the next day. Ron and Percy\\nwere next door to Harry. He had just closed and\\nlocked his own trunk when he heard angry voices\\nthrough the wall, and went to see what was going on.\\n \\nThe door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was\\nshouting.\\n“It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for\\npolishing — ”\\n“I haven’t touched it, all right?” Ron roared back.\\n“What’s up?” said Harry.\\n“My Head Boy badge is gone,” said Percy, rounding on\\nHarry.\\n“So’s Scabbers’s rat tonic,” said Ron, throwing things\\nout of his trunk to look. “I think I might’ve left it in\\nthe bar — ”\\n“You’re not going anywhere till you’ve found my\\nbadge!” yelled Percy.\\n“I’ll get Scabbers’s stuff, I’m packed,” Harry said to\\nRon, and he went downstairs.\\nHarry was halfway along the passage to the bar,\\nwhich was now very dark, when he heard another\\npair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second\\nlater, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs. Weasleys’.\\nHe hesitated, not wanting them to know he’d heard\\nthem arguing, when the sound of his own name made\\nhim stop, then move closer to the parlor door.\\n“... makes no sense not to tell him,” Mr. Weasley was\\nsaying heatedly. “Harry’s got a right to know. I’ve tried\\nto tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a\\nchild. He’s thirteen years old and — ”\\n“Arthur, the truth would terrify him!” said Mrs.\\nWeasley shrilly. “Do you really want to send Harry\\n \\nback to school with that hanging over him? For\\nheaven’s sake, he’s happy not knowing!”\\n“I don’t want to make him miserable, I want to put\\nhim on his guard!” retorted Mr. Weasley. “You know\\nwhat Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by\\nthemselves — they’ve even ended up in the Forbidden\\nForest! But Harry mustn’t do that this year! When I\\nthink what could have happened to him that night he\\nran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn’t picked\\nhim up, I’m prepared to bet he would have been dead\\nbefore the Ministry found him.”\\n“But he’s not dead, he’s fine, so what’s the point — ”\\n“Molly, they say Sirius Black’s mad, and maybe he is,\\nbut he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban,\\nand that’s supposed to be impossible. It’s been a\\nmonth, and no one’s seen hide nor hair of him, and I\\ndon’t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet,\\nwe’re no nearer catching Black than inventing self-\\nspelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is\\nwhat Black’s after — ”\\n“But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.”\\n“We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can\\nbreak out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.”\\n“But no one’s really sure that Black’s after Harry — ”\\nThere was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr.\\nWeasley had banged his fist on the table.\\n“Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They\\ndidn’t report it in the press because Fudge wanted it\\nkept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night\\nBlack escaped. The guards told Fudge that Black’s\\nbeen talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the\\n \\nsame words: ‘He’s at Hogwarts ... he’s at Hogwarts.’\\nBlack is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If\\nyou ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring\\nYou-Know-Who back to power. Black lost everything\\nthe night Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and he’s had\\ntwelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that. ...”\\nThere was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the\\ndoor, desperate to hear more.\\n“Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right.\\nBut you’re forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don’t think\\nanything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while\\nDumbledore ’s headmaster. I suppose he knows about\\nall this?”\\n“Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds\\nthe Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the\\nentrances to the school grounds. He wasn’t happy\\nabout it, but he agreed.”\\n“Not happy? Why shouldn’t he be happy, if they’re\\nthere to catch Black?”\\n“Dumbledore isn’t fond of the Azkaban guards,” said\\nMr. Weasley heavily. “Nor am I, if it comes to that ...\\nbut when you’re dealing with a wizard like Black, you\\nsometimes have to join forces with those you’d rather\\navoid.”\\n“If they save Harry — ”\\n“ — then I will never say another word against them,”\\nsaid Mr. Weasley wearily. “It’s late, Molly, we’d better\\ngo up. ...”\\nHarry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he\\nhurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight.\\nThe parlor door opened, and a few seconds later\\n \\nfootsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were\\nclimbing the stairs.\\nThe bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they\\nhad sat at earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr.\\nand Mrs. Weasley’s bedroom door close, then headed\\nback upstairs with the bottle.\\nFred and George were crouching in the shadows on\\nthe landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to\\nPercy dismantling his and Ron’s room in search of his\\nbadge.\\n“We’ve got it,” Fred whispered to Harry. “We’ve been\\nimproving it.”\\nThe badge now read BigheacL Boy.\\nHarry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic,\\nthen shut himself in his room and lay down on his\\nbed.\\nSo Sirius Black was after him. This explained\\neverything. Fudge had been lenient with him because\\nhe was so relieved to find him alive. He’d made Harry\\npromise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were\\nplenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was\\nsending two Ministry cars to take them all to the\\nstation tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look\\nafter Harry until he was on the train.\\nHarry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door\\nand wondered why he didn’t feel more scared. Sirius\\nBlack had murdered thirteen people with one curse;\\nMr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously thought Harry would\\nbe panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry\\nhappened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley\\nthat the safest place on earth was wherever Albus\\nDumbledore happened to be. Didn’t people always say\\n \\nthat Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort\\nhad ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort’s\\nright-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?\\nAnd then there were these Azkaban guards everyone\\nkept talking about. They seemed to scare most people\\nsenseless, and if they were stationed all around the\\nschool, Black’s chances of getting inside seemed very\\nremote.\\nNo, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was\\nthe fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now\\nlooked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave\\nthe safety of the castle until Black was caught; in\\nfact, Harry suspected his every move would be\\ncarefully watched until the danger had passed.\\nHe scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he\\ncouldn’t look after himself? He’d escaped Lord\\nVoldemort three times; he wasn’t completely useless.\\nUnbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of\\nMagnolia Crescent crossed his mind. What to do when\\nyou know the worst is coming. . . .\\n“I’m not going to be murdered,” Harry said out loud.\\n“That’s the spirit, dear,” said his mirror sleepily.\\n \\n5\\nTHE DEMENTOR\\nTom woke Harry the next morning with his usual\\ntoothless grin and a cup of tea. Harry got dressed and\\nwas just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back\\ninto her cage when Ron banged his way into the\\nroom, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking\\nirritable.\\n“The sooner we get on the train, the better,” he said.\\n“At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now\\nhe’s accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of\\nPenelope Clearwater. You know,” Ron grimaced, “his\\ngirlfriend. She’s hidden her face under the frame\\nbecause her nose has gone all blotchy. ...”\\n“I’ve got something to tell you,” Harry began, but they\\nwere interrupted by Fred and George, who had looked\\nin to congratulate Ron on infuriating Percy again.\\nThey headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley\\nwas reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a\\nfurrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling\\n \\nHermione and Ginny about a love potion she’d made\\nas a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.\\n“What were you saying?” Ron asked Harry as they sat\\ndown.\\n“Later,” Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.\\nHarry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in\\nthe chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all\\ntheir trunks down the Leaky Cauldron’s narrow\\nstaircase and piling them up near the door, with\\nHedwig and Hermes, Percy’s screech owl, perched on\\ntop in their cages. A small wickerwork basket stood\\nbeside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.\\n“It’s all right, Crookshanks,” Hermione cooed through\\nthe wickerwork. “I’ll let you out on the train.”\\n“You won’t,” snapped Ron. “What about poor\\nScabbers, eh?”\\nHe pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated\\nthat Scabbers was curled up in his pocket.\\nMr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the\\nMinistry cars, stuck his head inside.\\n“They’re here,” he said. “Harry, come on.”\\nMr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch\\nof pavement toward the first of two old-fashioned dark\\ngreen cars, each of which was driven by a furtive-\\nlooking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.\\n“In you get, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and\\ndown the crowded street.\\n \\nHarry got into the back of the car and was shortly\\njoined by Hermione, Ron, and, to Ron’s disgust,\\nPercy.\\nThe journey to King’s Cross was very uneventful\\ncompared with Harry’s trip on the Knight Bus. The\\nMinistry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary,\\nthough Harry noticed that they could slide through\\ngaps that Uncle Vernon’s new company car certainly\\ncouldn’t have managed. They reached King’s Cross\\nwith twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers\\nfound them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched\\ntheir hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away,\\nsomehow managing to jump to the head of an\\nunmoving line at the traffic lights.\\nMr. Weasley kept close to Harry’s elbow all the way\\ninto the station.\\n“Right then,” he said, glancing around them. “Let’s do\\nthis in pairs, as there are so many of us. I’ll go\\nthrough first with Harry.”\\nMr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between\\nplatforms nine and ten, pushing Harry’s trolley and\\napparently very interested in the Intercity 125 that\\nhad just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful\\nlook at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier.\\nHarry imitated him.\\nIn a moment, they had fallen sideways through the\\nsolid metal onto platform nine and three-quarters and\\nlooked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet\\nsteam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed\\nwith witches and wizards seeing their children onto\\nthe train.\\n \\nPercy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry.\\nThey were panting and had apparently taken the\\nbarrier at a run.\\n“Ah, there’s Penelope!” said Percy, smoothing his hair\\nand going pink again. Ginny caught Harry’s eye, and\\nthey both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy\\nstrode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with\\nhis chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his\\nshiny badge.\\nOnce the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had\\njoined them, Harry and Ron led the way to the end of\\nthe train, past packed compartments, to a carriage\\nthat looked quite empty. They loaded the trunks onto\\nit, stowed Hedwig and Crookshanks in the luggage\\nrack, then went back outside to say good-bye to Mr.\\nand Mrs. Weasley.\\nMrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione,\\nand finally, Harry. He was embarrassed, but really\\nquite pleased, when she gave him an extra hug.\\n“Do take care, won’t you, Harry?” she said as she\\nstraightened up, her eyes oddly bright. Then she\\nopened her enormous handbag and said, “I’ve made\\nyou all sandwiches. ... Here you are, Ron ... no,\\nthey’re not corned beef. ... Fred? Where’s Fred? Here\\nyou are, dear. ...”\\n“Harry,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “come over here a\\nmoment.”\\nHe jerked his head toward a pillar, and Harry followed\\nhim behind it, leaving the others crowded around\\nMrs. Weasley.\\n“There’s something I’ve got to tell you before you leave\\n— ” said Mr. Weasley, in a tense voice.\\n \\n“It’s all right, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry. “I already\\nknow.”\\n“You know? How could you know?”\\n“I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last\\nnight. I couldn’t help hearing,” Harry added quickly.\\n“Sorry — ”\\n“That’s not the way I’d have chosen for you to find\\nout,” said Mr. Weasley, looking anxious.\\n“No — honestly, it’s okay. This way, you haven’t\\nbroken your word to Fudge and I know what’s going\\non.”\\n“Harry, you must be very scared — ”\\n“I’m not,” said Harry sincerely. “Really” he added,\\nbecause Mr. Weasley was looking disbelieving. “I’m\\nnot trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius Black\\ncan’t be worse than Voldemort, can he?”\\nMr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name but\\noverlooked it.\\n“Harry, I knew you were, well, made of stronger stuff\\nthan Fudge seems to think, and I’m obviously pleased\\nthat you’re not scared, but — ”\\n“Arthur!” called Mrs. Weasley, who was now\\nshepherding the rest onto the train. “Arthur, what are\\nyou doing? It’s about to go!”\\n“He’s coming, Molly!” said Mr. Weasley but he turned\\nback to Harry and kept talking in a lower and more\\nhurried voice. “Listen, I want you to give me your\\nword — ”\\n \\n“ — that I’ll be a good boy and stay in the castle?” said\\nHarry gloomily.\\n“Not entirely,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked more\\nserious than Harry had ever seen him. “Harry, swear\\nto me you won’t go looking for Black.”\\nHarry stared. “What?”\\nThere was a loud whistle. Guards were walking along\\nthe train, slamming all the doors shut.\\n“Promise me, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, talking more\\nquickly still, “that whatever happens — ”\\n“Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to\\nkill me?” said Harry blankly.\\n“Swear to me that whatever you might hear — ”\\n“Arthur, quickly!” cried Mrs. Weasley.\\nSteam was billowing from the train; it had started to\\nmove. Harry ran to the compartment door and Ron\\nthrew it open and stood back to let him on. They\\nleaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs.\\nWeasley until the train turned a corner and blocked\\nthem from view.\\n“I need to talk to you in private,” Harry muttered to\\nRon and Hermione as the train picked up speed.\\n“Go away, Ginny,” said Ron.\\n“Oh, that’s nice,” said Ginny huffily, and she stalked\\noff.\\n \\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor,\\nlooking for an empty compartment, but all were full\\nexcept for the one at the very end of the train.\\nThis had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep\\nnext to the window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\nchecked on the threshold. The Hogwarts Express was\\nusually reserved for students and they had never seen\\nan adult there before, except for the witch who\\npushed the food cart.\\nThe stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of\\nwizard’s robes that had been darned in several places.\\nHe looked ill and exhausted. Though quite young, his\\nlight brown hair was flecked with gray.\\n“Who d’you reckon he is?” Ron hissed as they sat\\ndown and slid the door shut, taking the seats farthest\\naway from the window.\\n“Professor R. J. Lupin,” whispered Hermione at once.\\n“How d’you know that?”\\n“It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage\\nrack over the man’s head, where there was a small,\\nbattered case held together with a large quantity of\\nneatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin\\nwas stamped across one corner in peeling letters.\\n“Wonder what he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at\\nProfessor Lupin’s pallid profile.\\n“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only\\none vacancy, isn’t there? Defense Against the Dark\\nArts.”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of\\n \\nwhom had lasted only one year. There were rumors\\nthat the job was jinxed.\\n“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He\\nlooks like one good hex would finish him off, doesn’t\\nhe? Anyway ...” He turned to Harry. “What were you\\ngoing to tell us?”\\nHarry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s\\nargument and the warning Mr. Weasley had just\\ngiven him. When he’d finished, Ron looked\\nthunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her\\nmouth. She finally lowered them to say, “Sirius Black\\nescaped to come after you? Oh, Harry ... you’ll have to\\nbe really, really careful. Don’t go looking for trouble,\\nHarry — ”\\n“I don’t go looking for trouble,” said Harry, nettled.\\n“Trouble usually finds me.”\\n“How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a\\nnutter who wants to kill him?” said Ron shakily.\\nThey were taking the news worse than Harry had\\nexpected. Both Ron and Hermione seemed to be much\\nmore frightened of Black than he was.\\n“No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,” said Ron\\nuncomfortably. “No one’s ever done it before. And he\\nwas a top-security prisoner too.”\\n“But they’ll catch him, won’t they?” said Hermione\\nearnestly. “I mean, they’ve got all the Muggles looking\\nout for him too. ...”\\n“What’s that noise?” said Ron suddenly.\\nA faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from\\nsomewhere. They looked all around the compartment.\\n \\n“It’s coming from your trunk, Harry,” said Ron,\\nstanding up and reaching into the luggage rack. A\\nmoment later he had pulled the Pocket Sneakoscope\\nout from between Harry’s robes. It was spinning very\\nfast in the palm of Ron’s hand and glowing brilliantly.\\n“Is that a Sneakoscope?” said Hermione interestedly,\\nstanding up for a better look.\\n“Yeah ... mind you, it’s a very cheap one,” Ron said.\\n“It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol’s leg to\\nsend it to Harry.”\\n“Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?”\\nsaid Hermione shrewdly.\\n“No! Well ... I wasn’t supposed to be using Errol. You\\nknow he’s not really up to long journeys ... but how\\nelse was I supposed to get Harry’s present to him?”\\n“Stick it back in the trunk,” Harry advised as the\\nSneakoscope whistled piercingly, “or it’ll wake him\\nup.”\\nHe nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the\\nSneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle\\nVernon’s old socks, which deadened the sound, then\\nclosed the lid of the trunk on it.\\n“We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,” said Ron,\\nsitting back down. “They sell that sort of thing in\\nDervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff.\\nFred and George told me.”\\n“Do you know much about Hogsmeade?” asked\\nHermione keenly. “I’ve read it’s the only entirely non-\\nMuggle settlement in Britain — ”\\n \\n“Yeah, I think it is,” said Ron in an offhand sort of\\nway, “but that’s not why I want to go. I just want to\\nget inside Honeydukes!”\\n“What’s that?” said Hermione.\\n“It’s this sweetshop,” said Ron, a dreamy look coming\\nover his face, “where they’ve got everything. ... Pepper\\nImps — they make you smoke at the mouth — and\\ngreat fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and\\nclotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which\\nyou can suck in class and just look like you’re\\nthinking what to write next — ”\\n“But Hogsmeade’s a very interesting place, isn’t it?”\\nHermione pressed on eagerly. “In Sites of Historical\\nSorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the\\n1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack’s\\nsupposed to be the most severely haunted building in\\nBritain — ”\\n“ — and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a\\nfew inches off the ground while you’re sucking them,”\\nsaid Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word\\nHermione was saying.\\nHermione looked around at Harry.\\n“Won’t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and\\nexplore Hogsmeade?”\\n“ ’Spect it will,” said Harry heavily. “You’ll have to tell\\nme when you’ve found out.”\\n“What d’you mean?” said Ron.\\n“I can’t go. The Dursleys didn’t sign my permission\\nform, and Fudge wouldn’t either.”\\n \\nRon looked horrified.\\n“You’re not allowed to come? But — no way —\\nMcGonagall or someone will give you permission — ”\\nHarry gave a hollow laugh. Professor McGonagall,\\nhead of Gryffindor House, was very strict.\\n“ — or we can ask Fred and George, they know every\\nsecret passage out of the castle — ”\\n“Ron!” said Hermione sharply. “I don’t think Harry\\nshould be sneaking out of school with Black on the\\nloose — ”\\n“Yeah, I expect that’s what McGonagall will say when\\nI ask for permission,” said Harry bitterly.\\n“But if we’re with him,” said Ron spiritedly to\\nHermione, “Black wouldn’t dare — ”\\n“Oh, Ron, don’t talk rubbish,” snapped Hermione.\\n“Black’s already murdered a whole bunch of people in\\nthe middle of a crowded street. Do you really think\\nhe’s going to worry about attacking Harry just\\nbecause we’re there?”\\nShe was fumbling with the straps of Crookshanks’s\\nbasket as she spoke.\\n“Don’t let that thing out!” Ron said, but too late;\\nCrookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched,\\nyawned, and sprang onto Ron’s knees; the lump in\\nRon’s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks\\nangrily away.\\n“Get out of here!”\\n“Ron, don’t!” said Hermione angrily.\\n \\nRon was about to answer back when Professor Lupin\\nstirred. They watched him apprehensively, but he\\nsimply turned his head the other way, mouth slightly\\nopen, and slept on.\\nThe Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the\\nscenery outside the window became wilder and darker\\nwhile the clouds overhead thickened. People were\\nchasing backward and forward past the door of their\\ncompartment. Crookshanks had now settled in an\\nempty seat, his squashed face turned toward Ron, his\\nyellow eyes on Ron’s top pocket.\\nAt one o’clock, the plump witch with the food cart\\narrived at the compartment door.\\n“D’you think we should wake him up?” Ron asked\\nawkwardly, nodding toward Professor Lupin. “He\\nlooks like he could do with some food.”\\nHermione approached Professor Lupin cautiously.\\n“Er — Professor?” she said. “Excuse me — Professor?”\\nHe didn’t move.\\n“Don’t worry, dear,” said the witch as she handed\\nHarry a large stack of Cauldron Cakes. “If he’s hungry\\nwhen he wakes, I’ll be up front with the driver.”\\n“I suppose he is asleep?” said Ron quietly as the witch\\nslid the compartment door closed. “I mean — he\\nhasn’t died, has he?”\\n“No, no, he’s breathing,” whispered Hermione, taking\\nthe Cauldron Cake Harry passed her.\\nHe might not be very good company, but Professor\\nLupin’s presence in their compartment had its uses.\\n \\nMidafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring\\nthe rolling hills outside the window, they heard\\nfootsteps in the corridor again, and their three least\\nfavorite people appeared at the door: Draco Malfoy,\\nflanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory\\nGoyle.\\nDraco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since\\nthey had met on their very first train journey to\\nHogwarts. Malfoy, who had a pale, pointed, sneering\\nface, was in Slytherin House; he played Seeker on the\\nSlytherin Quidditch team, the same position that\\nHarry played on the Gryffindor team. Crabbe and\\nGoyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy’s bidding. They\\nwere both wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with\\na pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle\\nhad short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.\\n“Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy\\ndrawl, pulling open the compartment door. “Potty and\\nthe Weasel.”\\nCrabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.\\n“I heard your father finally got his hands on some\\ngold this summer, Weasley,” said Malfoy. “Did your\\nmother die of shock?”\\nRon stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks’s\\nbasket to the floor. Professor Lupin gave a snort.\\n“Who’s that?” said Malfoy, taking an automatic step\\nbackward as he spotted Lupin.\\n“New teacher,” said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in\\ncase he needed to hold Ron back. “What were you\\nsaying, Malfoy?”\\n \\nMalfoy’s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn’t fool enough to\\npick a fight right under a teacher’s nose.\\n“C’mon,” he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and\\nGoyle, and they disappeared.\\nHarry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his\\nknuckles.\\n“I’m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,”\\nhe said angrily. “I mean it. If he makes one more\\ncrack about my family, I’m going to get hold of his\\nhead and — ”\\nRon made a violent gesture in midair.\\n“Ron,” hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin,\\n“be careful ...”\\nBut Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.\\nThe rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north;\\nthe windows were now a solid, shimmering gray,\\nwhich gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into\\nlife all along the corridors and over the luggage racks.\\nThe train rattled, the rain hammered, the wind\\nroared, but still, Professor Lupin slept.\\n“We must be nearly there,” said Ron, leaning forward\\nto look past Professor Lupin at the now completely\\nblack window.\\nThe words had hardly left him when the train started\\nto slow down.\\n“Great,” said Ron, getting up and walking carefully\\npast Professor Lupin to try and see outside. “I’m\\nstarving. I want to get to the feast. ...”\\n \\n“We can’t be there yet,” said Hermione, checking her\\nwatch.\\n“So why’re we stopping?”\\nThe train was getting slower and slower. As the noise\\nof the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded\\nlouder than ever against the windows.\\nHarry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into\\nthe corridor. All along the carriage, heads were\\nsticking curiously out of their compartments.\\nThe train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds\\nand bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of\\nthe racks. Then, without warning, all the lamps went\\nout and they were plunged into total darkness.\\n“What’s going on?” said Ron’s voice from behind\\nHarry.\\n“Ouch!” gasped Hermione. “Ron, that was my foot!”\\nHarry felt his way back to his seat.\\n“D’you think we’ve broken down?”\\n“Dunno ...”\\nThere was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim\\nblack outline of Ron, wiping a patch clean on the\\nwindow and peering out.\\n“There’s something moving out there,” Ron said. “I\\nthink people are coming aboard. ...”\\nThe compartment door suddenly opened and someone\\nfell painfully over Harry’s legs.\\n \\n“Sorry — d’you know what’s going on? — Ouch —\\nsorry — ”\\n“Hullo, Neville,” said Harry, feeling around in the dark\\nand pulling Neville up by his cloak.\\n“Harry? Is that you? What’s happening?”\\n“No idea — sit down — ”\\nThere was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville\\nhad tried to sit on Crookshanks.\\n“I’m going to go and ask the driver what’s going on,”\\ncame Hermione’s voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard\\nthe door slide open again, and then a thud and two\\nloud squeals of pain.\\n“Who’s that?”\\n“Who’s that?”\\n“Ginny?”\\n“Hermione?”\\n“What are you doing?”\\n“I was looking for Ron — ”\\n“Come in and sit down — ”\\n“Not here!” said Harry hurriedly. “I’m here!”\\n“Ouch!” said Neville.\\n“Quiet!” said a hoarse voice suddenly.\\n \\nProfessor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last.\\nHarry could hear movements in his corner. None of\\nthem spoke.\\nThere was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering\\nlight filled the compartment. Professor Lupin\\nappeared to be holding a handful of flames. They\\nilluminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked\\nalert and wary.\\n“Stay where you are,” he said in the same hoarse\\nvoice, and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of\\nfire held out in front of him.\\nBut the door slid slowly open before Lupin could\\nreach it.\\nStanding in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering\\nflames in Lupin’s hand, was a cloaked figure that\\ntowered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden\\nbeneath its hood. Harry’s eyes darted downward, and\\nwhat he saw made his stomach contract. There was a\\nhand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening,\\ngrayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something\\ndead that had decayed in water. . . .\\nBut it was visible only for a split second. As though\\nthe creature beneath the cloak sensed Harry’s gaze,\\nthe hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its\\nblack cloak.\\nAnd then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it\\nwas, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it\\nwere trying to suck something more than air from its\\nsurroundings.\\nAn intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his\\nown breath catch in his chest. The cold went deeper\\n \\nthan his skin. It was inside his chest, it was inside\\nhis very heart. ...\\nHarry’s eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn’t see.\\nHe was drowning in cold. There was a rushing in his\\nears as though of water. He was being dragged\\ndownward, the roaring growing louder . . .\\nAnd then, from far away, he heard screaming,\\nterrible, terrified, pleading screams. He wanted to\\nhelp whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but\\ncouldn’t ... a thick white fog was swirling around him,\\ninside him —\\n“Harry! Harry! Are you all right?”\\nSomeone was slapping his face.\\n“W — what?”\\nHarry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above\\nhim, and the floor was shaking — the Hogwarts\\nExpress was moving again and the lights had come\\nback on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto\\nthe floor. Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to\\nhim, and above them he could see Neville and\\nProfessor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when\\nhe put up his hand to push his glasses back on, he\\nfelt cold sweat on his face.\\nRon and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.\\n“Are you okay?” Ron asked nervously.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, looking quickly toward the door.\\nThe hooded creature had vanished. “What happened?\\nWhere’s that — that thing? Who screamed?”\\n“No one screamed,” said Ron, more nervously still.\\n \\nHarry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny\\nand Neville looked back at him, both very pale.\\n“But I heard screaming — ”\\nA loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was\\nbreaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.\\n“Here,” he said to Harry, handing him a particularly\\nlarge piece. “Eat it. It’ll help.”\\nHarry took the chocolate but didn’t eat it.\\n“What was that thing?” he asked Lupin.\\n“A dementor,” said Lupin, who was now giving\\nchocolate to everyone else. “One of the dementors of\\nAzkaban.”\\nEveryone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up\\nthe empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket.\\n“Eat,” he repeated. “It’ll help. I need to speak to the\\ndriver, excuse me ...”\\nHe strolled past Harry and disappeared into the\\ncorridor.\\n“Are you sure you’re okay, Harry?” said Hermione,\\nwatching Harry anxiously.\\n“I don’t get it. ... What happened?” said Harry, wiping\\nmore sweat off his face.\\n“Well — that thing — the dementor — stood there and\\nlooked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn’t see its\\nface) — and you — you — ”\\n \\n“I thought you were having a fit or something,” said\\nRon, who still looked scared. “You went sort of rigid\\nand fell out of your seat and started twitching — ”\\n“And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked\\ntoward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,” said\\nHermione, “and he said, ‘None of us is hiding Sirius\\nBlack under our cloaks. Go.’ But the dementor didn’t\\nmove, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery\\nthing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around\\nand sort of glided away. ...”\\n“It was horrible,” said Neville, in a higher voice than\\nusual. “Did you feel how cold it got when it came in?”\\n“I felt weird,” said Ron, shifting his shoulders\\nuncomfortably. “Like I’d never be cheerful again. ...”\\nGinny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly\\nas bad as Harry felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went\\nover and put a comforting arm around her.\\n“But didn’t any of you — fall off your seats?” said\\nHarry awkwardly.\\n“No,” said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again.\\n“Ginny was shaking like mad, though. ...”\\nHarry didn’t understand. He felt weak and shivery, as\\nthough he were recovering from a bad bout of flu; he\\nalso felt the beginnings of shame. Why had he gone to\\npieces like that, when no one else had?\\nProfessor Lupin had come back. He paused as he\\nentered, looked around, and said, with a small smile,\\n“I haven’t poisoned that chocolate, you know. ...”\\n \\nHarry took a bite and to his great surprise felt\\nwarmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and\\ntoes.\\n“Well be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,” said Professor\\nLupin. “Are you all right, Harry?”\\nHarry didn’t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.\\n“Fine,” he muttered, embarrassed.\\nThey didn’t talk much during the remainder of the\\njourney. At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade\\nstation, and there was a great scramble to get\\noutside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville’s pet\\ntoad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was\\nfreezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down\\nin icy sheets.\\n“Firs’ years this way!” called a familiar voice. Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic\\noutline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform,\\nbeckoning the terrified-looking new students forward\\nfor their traditional journey across the lake.\\n“All righ’, you three?” Hagrid yelled over the heads of\\nthe crowd. They waved at him, but had no chance to\\nspeak to him because the mass of people around\\nthem was shunting them away along the platform.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the\\nschool along the platform and out onto a rough mud\\ntrack, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited\\nthe remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only\\nassume, by an invisible horse, because when they\\nclimbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all\\nby itself, bumping and swaying in procession.\\nThe coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry\\nfelt better since the chocolate, but still weak. Ron and\\n \\nHermione kept looking at him sideways, as though\\nfrightened he might collapse again.\\nAs the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent\\nwrought iron gates, flanked with stone columns\\ntopped with winged boars, Harry saw two more\\ntowering, hooded dementors, standing guard on\\neither side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to\\nengulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat\\nand closed his eyes until they had passed the gates.\\nThe carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping\\ndrive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of\\nthe tiny window, watching the many turrets and\\ntowers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a\\nhalt, and Hermione and Ron got out.\\nAs Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice\\nsounded in his ear.\\n“You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottom telling the truth?\\nYou actually fainted?”\\nMalfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry’s way\\nup the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and\\nhis pale eyes glinting maliciously.\\n“Shove off, Malfoy,” said Ron, whose jaw was\\nclenched.\\n“Did you faint as well, Weasley?” said Malfoy loudly.\\n“Did the scary old dementor frighten you too,\\nWeasley?”\\n“Is there a problem?” said a mild voice. Professor\\nLupin had just gotten out of the next carriage.\\nMalfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which\\ntook in the patches on his robes and the delapidated\\nsuitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, he\\n \\nsaid, “Oh, no — er — Professor,” then he smirked at\\nCrabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the\\ncastle.\\nHermione prodded Ron in the back to make him\\nhurry, and the three of them joined the crowd\\nswarming up the steps, through the giant oak front\\ndoors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit\\nwith flaming torches, and housed a magnificent\\nmarble staircase that led to the upper floors.\\nThe door into the Great Hall stood open at the right;\\nHarry followed the crowd toward it, but had barely\\nglimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and\\ncloudy tonight, when a voice called, “Potter! Granger!\\nI want to see you both!”\\nHarry and Hermione turned around, surprised.\\nProfessor McGonagall, Transfiguration teacher and\\nhead of Gryffindor House, was calling over the heads\\nof the crowd. She was a stern-looking witch who wore\\nher hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed\\nwith square spectacles. Harry fought his way over to\\nher with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall\\nhad a way of making him feel he must have done\\nsomething wrong.\\n“There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a\\nword in my office,” she told them. “Move along there,\\nWeasley.”\\nRon stared as Professor McGonagall ushered\\nHarry and Hermione away from the chattering crowd;\\nthey accompanied her across the entrance hall, up\\nthe marble staircase, and along a corridor.\\nOnce they were in her office, a small room with a\\nlarge, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned\\nHarry and Hermione to sit down. She settled herself\\n \\nbehind her desk and said abruptly, “Professor Lupin\\nsent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on\\nthe train, Potter.”\\nBefore Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on\\nthe door and Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, came\\nbustling in.\\nHarry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad\\nenough that he’d passed out, or whatever he had\\ndone, without everyone making all this fuss.\\n“I’m fine,” he said, “I don’t need anything — ”\\n“Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring\\nthis and bending down to stare closely at him. “I\\nsuppose you’ve been doing something dangerous\\nagain?”\\n“It was a dementor, Poppy,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall.\\nThey exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey\\nclucked disapprovingly.\\n“Setting dementors around a school,” she muttered,\\npushing back Harry’s hair and feeling his forehead.\\n“He won’t be the last one who collapses. Yes, he’s all\\nclammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they\\nhave on people who are already delicate — ”\\n“I’m not delicate!” said Harry crossly.\\n“Of course you’re not,” said Madam Pomfrey\\nabsentmindedly, now taking his pulse.\\n“What does he need?” said Professor McGonagall\\ncrisply. “Bed rest? Should he perhaps spend tonight\\nin the hospital wing?”\\n \\n‘Tm /ine!” said Harry, jumping up. The thought of\\nwhat Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the\\nhospital wing was torture.\\n“Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very\\nleast,” said Madam Pomfrey, who was now trying to\\npeer into Harry’s eyes.\\n“I’ve already had some,” said Harry. “Professor Lupin\\ngave me some. He gave it to all of us.”\\n“Did he, now?” said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. “So\\nwe’ve finally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts\\nteacher who knows his remedies?”\\n“Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?” Professor\\nMcGonagall said sharply.\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\n“Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick\\nword with Miss Granger about her course schedule,\\nthen we can go down to the feast together.”\\nHarry went back into the corridor with Madam\\nPomfrey, who left for the hospital wing, muttering to\\nherself. He had to wait only a few minutes; then\\nHermione emerged looking very happy about\\nsomething, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the\\nthree of them made their way back down the marble\\nstaircase to the Great Hall.\\nIt was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long\\nHouse tables was lined with students, their faces\\nglimmering by the light of thousands of candles,\\nwhich were floating over the tables in midair.\\nProfessor Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a\\nshock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and\\na three-legged stool out of the hall.\\n \\n“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the\\nSorting!”\\nNew students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by\\ntrying on the Sorting Hat, which shouted out the\\nHouse they were best suited to (Gryffindor,\\nRavenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor\\nMcGonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the\\nstaff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the\\nother direction, as quietly as possible, toward the\\nGryffindor table. People looked around at them as\\nthey passed along the back of the hall, and a few of\\nthem pointed at Harry. Had the story of his collapsing\\nin front of the dementor traveled that fast?\\nHe and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who\\nhad saved them seats.\\n“What was all that about?” he muttered to Harry.\\nHarry started to explain in a whisper, but at that\\nmoment the headmaster stood up to speak, and he\\nbroke off.\\nProfessor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave\\nan impression of great energy. He had several feet of\\nlong silver hair and beard, half-moon spectacles, and\\nan extremely crooked nose. He was often described as\\nthe greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn’t why\\nHarry respected him. You couldn’t help trusting Albus\\nDumbledore, and as Harry watched him beaming\\naround at the students, he felt really calm for the first\\ntime since the dementor had entered the train\\ncompartment.\\n“Welcome!” said Dumbledore, the candlelight\\nshimmering on his beard. “Welcome to another year\\nat Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you all, and\\nas one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it\\n \\nout of the way before you become befuddled by our\\nexcellent feast. ...”\\nDumbledore cleared his throat and continued, “As\\nyou will all be aware after their search of the\\nHogwarts Express, our school is presently playing\\nhost to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are\\nhere on Ministry of Magic business.”\\nHe paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley\\nhad said about Dumbledore not being happy with the\\ndementors guarding the school.\\n“They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,”\\nDumbledore continued, “and while they are with us, I\\nmust make it plain that nobody is to leave school\\nwithout permission. Dementors are not to be fooled\\nby tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility Cloaks,”\\nhe added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each\\nother. “It is not in the nature of a dementor to\\nunderstand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn\\neach and every one of you to give them no reason to\\nharm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head\\nBoy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul\\nof the dementors,” he said.\\nPercy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry,\\npuffed out his chest again and stared around\\nimpressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked\\nvery seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or\\nmade a sound.\\n“On a happier note,” he continued, “I am pleased to\\nwelcome two new teachers to our ranks this year.\\n“First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to\\nfill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”\\n \\nThere was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic\\napplause. Only those who had been in the\\ncompartment on the train with Professor Lupin\\nclapped hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin\\nlooked particularly shabby next to all the other\\nteachers in their best robes.\\n“Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear.\\nProfessor Snape, the Potions master, was staring\\nalong the staff table at Professor Lupin. It was\\ncommon knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated\\nSnape, was startled at the expression twisting his\\nthin, sallow face. It was beyond anger: it was loathing.\\nHarry knew that expression only too well; it was the\\nlook Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.\\n“As to our second new appointment,” Dumbledore\\ncontinued as the lukewarm applause for Professor\\nLupin died away. “Well, I am sorry to tell you that\\nProfessor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures\\nteacher, retired at the end of last year in order to\\nenjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I\\nam delighted to say that his place will be filled by\\nnone other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to\\ntake on this teaching job in addition to his\\ngamekeeping duties.”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another,\\nstunned. Then they joined in with the applause,\\nwhich was tumultuous at the Gryffindor table in\\nparticular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who\\nwas ruby-red in the face and staring down at his\\nenormous hands, his wide grin hidden in the tangle of\\nhis black beard.\\n \\n“We should’ve known!” Ron roared, pounding the\\ntable. “Who else would have assigned us a biting\\nbook?”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop\\nclapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started\\nspeaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his\\neyes on the tablecloth.\\n“Well, I think that’s everything of importance,” said\\nDumbledore. “Let the feast begin!”\\nThe golden plates and goblets before them filled\\nsuddenly with food and drink. Harry, suddenly\\nravenous, helped himself to everything he could reach\\nand began to eat.\\nIt was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk,\\nlaughter, and the clatter of knives and forks. Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione, however, were eager for it to\\nfinish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew\\nhow much being made a teacher would mean to him.\\nHagrid wasn’t a fully qualified wizard; he had been\\nexpelled from Hogwarts in his third year for a crime\\nhe had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione who had cleared Hagrid ’s name last year.\\nAt long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart\\nhad melted from the golden platters, Dumbledore\\ngave the word that it was time for them all to go to\\nbed, and they got their chance.\\n“Congratulations, Hagrid!” Hermione squealed as they\\nreached the teachers’ table.\\n“All down ter you three,” said Hagrid, wiping his\\nshining face on his napkin as he looked up at them.\\n“Can’ believe it ... great man, Dumbledore ... came\\nstraight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn\\n \\nsaid he’d had enough. ... It’s what I always wanted.\\nOvercome with emotion, he buried his face in his\\nnapkin, and Professor McGonagall shooed them away.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors\\nstreaming up the marble staircase and, very tired\\nnow, along more corridors, up more and more stairs,\\nto the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower. A large\\nportrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them,\\n“Password?”\\n“Coming through, coming through!” Percy called from\\nbehind the crowd. “The new password’s ‘Fortuna\\nMajor’!”\\n“Oh no,” said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always\\nhad trouble remembering the passwords.\\nThrough the portrait hole and across the common\\nroom, the girls and boys divided toward their separate\\nstaircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair with no\\nthought in his head except how glad he was to be\\nback. They reached their familiar, circular dormitory\\nwith its five four-poster beds, and Harry, looking\\naround, felt he was home at last.\\n \\nTALONS AND TEA LEAVES\\nWhen Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great\\nHall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they\\nsaw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining\\na large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As\\nthey passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a\\nswooning fit and there was a roar of laughter.\\n“Ignore him,” said Hermione, who was right behind\\nHarry. “Just ignore him, it’s not worth it. ...”\\n“Hey, Potter!” shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin\\ngirl with a face like a pug. “Potter! The dementors are\\ncoming, Potter! Woooooooo!”\\nHarry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next\\nto George Weasley.\\n“New third-year course schedules,” said George,\\npassing them over. “What’s up with you, Harry?”\\n“Malfoy,” said Ron, sitting down on George’s other\\nside and glaring over at the Slytherin table.\\n \\nGeorge looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to\\nfaint with terror again.\\n“That little git,” he said calmly. “He wasn’t so cocky\\nlast night when the dementors were down at our end\\nof the train. Came running into our compartment,\\ndidn’t he, Fred?”\\n“Nearly wet himself,” said Fred, with a contemptuous\\nglance at Malfoy.\\n“I wasn’t too happy myself,” said George. “They’re\\nhorrible things, those dementors. ...”\\n“Sort of freeze your insides, don’t they?” said Fred.\\n“You didn’t pass out, though, did you?” said Harry in\\na low voice.\\n“Forget it, Harry,” said George bracingly. “Dad had to\\ngo out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he\\nsaid it was the worst place he’d ever been, he came\\nback all weak and shaking. . . . They suck the\\nhappiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the\\nprisoners go mad in there.”\\n“Anyway, we’ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our\\nfirst Quidditch match,” said Fred. “Gryffindor versus\\nSlytherin, first game of the season, remember?”\\nThe only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other\\nin a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off\\nworse. Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped\\nhimself to sausages and fried tomatoes.\\nHermione was examining her new schedule.\\n“Ooh, good, we’re starting some new subjects today,”\\nshe said happily.\\n \\n“Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he looked over her\\nshoulder, “they’ve messed up your schedule. Look —\\nthey’ve got you down for about ten subjects a day.\\nThere isn’t enough time.”\\n“I’ll manage. I’ve fixed it all with Professor\\nMcGonagall.”\\n“But look,” said Ron, laughing, “see this morning?\\nNine o’clock, Divination. And underneath, nine\\no’clock, Muggle Studies. And” — Ron leaned closer to\\nthe schedule, disbelieving — “ look — underneath\\nthat, Arithmancy, nine o’clock. I mean, I know you’re\\ngood, Hermione, but no one’s that good. How’re you\\nsupposed to be in three classes at once?”\\n“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione shortly. “Of course I\\nwon’t be in three classes at once.”\\n“Well, then — ”\\n“Pass the marmalade,” said Hermione.\\n“But — ”\\n“Oh, Ron, what’s it to you if my schedule’s a bit full?”\\nHermione snapped. “I told you, I’ve fixed it all with\\nProfessor McGonagall.”\\nJust then, Hagrid entered the Great Hall. He was\\nwearing his long moleskin overcoat and was\\nabsentmindedly swinging a dead polecat from one\\nenormous hand.\\n“All righ’?” he said eagerly, pausing on the way to the\\nstaff table. “Yer in my firs’ ever lesson! Right after\\nlunch! Bin up since five gettin’ everythin’ ready. ...\\nHope it’s okay. ... Me, a teacher ... hones’ly. ...”\\n \\nHe grinned broadly at them and headed off to the\\nstaff table, still swinging the polecat.\\n“Wonder what he’s been getting ready?” said Ron, a\\nnote of anxiety in his voice.\\nThe hall was starting to empty as people headed off\\ntoward their first lesson. Ron checked his course\\nschedule.\\n“We’d better go, look, Divination’s at the top of North\\nTower. It’ll take us ten minutes to get there. ...”\\nThey finished their breakfasts hastily, said good-bye\\nto Fred and George, and walked back through the\\nhall. As they passed the Slytherin table, Malfoy did\\nyet another impression of a fainting fit. The shouts of\\nlaughter followed Harry into the entrance hall.\\nThe journey through the castle to North Tower was a\\nlong one. Two years at Hogwarts hadn’t taught them\\neverything about the castle, and they had never been\\ninside North Tower before.\\n“There’s — got — to — be — a — shortcut,” Ron\\npanted as they climbed their seventh long staircase\\nand emerged on an unfamiliar landing, where there\\nwas nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of\\ngrass hanging on the stone wall.\\n“I think it’s this way,” said Hermione, peering down\\nthe empty passage to the right.\\n“Can’t be,” said Ron. “That’s south, look, you can see\\na bit of the lake out of the window ...”\\nHarry was watching the painting. A fat, dapple-gray\\npony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing\\nnonchalantly. Harry was used to the subjects of\\n \\nHogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their\\nframes to visit one another, but he always enjoyed\\nwatching it. A moment later, a short, squat knight in\\na suit of armor clanked into the picture after his\\npony. By the look of the grass stains on his metal\\nknees, he had just fallen off.\\n“Aha!” he yelled, seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\n“What villains are these, that trespass upon my\\nprivate lands! Come to scorn at my fall, perchance?\\nDraw, you knaves, you dogs!”\\nThey watched in astonishment as the little knight\\ntugged his sword out of its scabbard and began\\nbrandishing it violently, hopping up and down in\\nrage. But the sword was too long for him; a\\nparticularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he\\nlanded facedown in the grass.\\n“Are you all right?” said Harry, moving closer to the\\npicture.\\n“Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!”\\nThe knight seized his sword again and used it to push\\nhimself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the\\ngrass and, though he pulled with all his might, he\\ncouldn’t get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back\\ndown onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his\\nsweating face.\\n“Listen,” said Harry, taking advantage of the knight’s\\nexhaustion, “we’re looking for the North Tower. You\\ndon’t know the way, do you?”\\n“A quest!” The knight’s rage seemed to vanish\\ninstantly. He clanked to his feet and shouted, “Come\\nfollow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or\\nelse shall perish bravely in the charge!”\\n \\nHe gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and\\nfailed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, “On\\nfoot then, good sirs and gentle lady! On! On!”\\nAnd he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the\\nframe and out of sight.\\nThey hurried after him along the corridor, following\\nthe sound of his armor. Every now and then they\\nspotted him running through a picture ahead.\\n“Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!” yelled the\\nknight, and they saw him reappear in front of an\\nalarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture\\nhung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.\\nPuffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the\\ntightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier,\\nuntil at last they heard the murmur of voices above\\nthem and knew they had reached the classroom.\\n“Farewell!” cried the knight, popping his head into a\\npainting of some sinister-looking monks. “Farewell,\\nmy comrades-in-arms! If ever you have need of noble\\nheart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!”\\n“Yeah, well call you,” muttered Ron as the knight\\ndisappeared, “if we ever need someone mental.”\\nThey climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a\\ntiny landing, where most of the class was already\\nassembled. There were no doors off this landing, but\\nRon nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where\\nthere was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on\\nit.\\n“ ‘Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,’ ” Harry read.\\n“How’re we supposed to get up there?”\\n \\nAs though in answer to his question, the trapdoor\\nsuddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended\\nright at Harry’s feet. Everyone got quiet.\\n“After you,” said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the\\nladder first.\\nHe emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he\\nhad ever seen. In fact, it didn’t look like a classroom\\nat all, more like a cross between someone’s attic and\\nan old-fashioned tea shop. At least twenty small,\\ncircular tables were crammed inside it, all\\nsurrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs.\\nEverything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the\\ncurtains at the windows were all closed, and the\\nmany lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It\\nwas stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning\\nunder the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a\\nheavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large\\ncopper kettle. The shelves running around the\\ncircular walls were crammed with dusty-looking\\nfeathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered\\nplaying cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a\\nhuge array of teacups.\\nRon appeared at Harry’s shoulder as the class\\nassembled around them, all talking in whispers.\\n“Where is she?” Ron said.\\nA voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft,\\nmisty sort of voice.\\n“Welcome,” it said. “How nice to see you in the\\nphysical world at last.”\\nHarry’s immediate impression was of a large,\\nglittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into the\\nfirelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her\\n \\nlarge glasses magnified her eyes to several times their\\nnatural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled\\nshawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around\\nher spindly neck, and her arms and hands were\\nencrusted with bangles and rings.\\n“Sit, my children, sit,” she said, and they all climbed\\nawkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione sat themselves around the same\\nround table.\\n“Welcome to Divination,” said Professor Trelawney,\\nwho had seated herself in a winged armchair in front\\nof the fire. “My name is Professor Trelawney. You may\\nnot have seen me before. I find that descending too\\noften into the hustle and bustle of the main school\\nclouds my Inner Eye.”\\nNobody said anything to this extraordinary\\npronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately\\nrearranged her shawl and continued, “So you have\\nchosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all\\nmagical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if\\nyou do not have the Sight, there is very little I will be\\nable to teach you. Books can take you only so far in\\nthis field. ...”\\nAt these words, both Harry and Ron glanced,\\ngrinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the\\nnews that books wouldn’t be much help in this\\nsubject.\\n“Many witches and wizards, talented though they are\\nin the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden\\ndisappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled\\nmysteries of the future,” Professor Trelawney went on,\\nher enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to\\nnervous face. “It is a Gift granted to few. You, boy,”\\n \\nshe said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off\\nhis pouf. “Is your grandmother well?”\\n“I think so,” said Neville tremulously.\\n“I wouldn’t be so sure if I were you, dear,” said\\nProfessor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long\\nemerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney\\ncontinued placidly. “We will be covering the basic\\nmethods of Divination this year. The first term will be\\ndevoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall\\nprogress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,” she shot\\nsuddenly at Parvati Patil, “beware a red-haired man.”\\nParvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right\\nbehind her, and edged her chair away from him.\\n“In the second term,” Professor Trelawney went on,\\n“we shall progress to the crystal ball — if we have\\nfinished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately,\\nclasses will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout\\nof flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter,\\none of our number will leave us forever.”\\nA very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but\\nProfessor Trelawney seemed unaware of it.\\n“I wonder, dear,” she said to Lavender Brown, who\\nwas nearest and shrank back in her chair, “if you\\ncould pass me the largest silver teapot?”\\nLavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an\\nenormous teapot from the shelf, and put it down on\\nthe table in front of Professor Trelawney.\\n“Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are\\ndreading — it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of\\nOctober.”\\n \\nLavender trembled.\\n“Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a\\nteacup from the shelf, come to me, and I will fill it.\\nThen sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs\\nremain. Swill these around the cup three times with\\nthe left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its\\nsaucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then\\ngive your cup to your partner to read. You will\\ninterpret the patterns using pages five and six of\\nUnfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping\\nand instructing. Oh, and dear” — she caught Neville\\nby the arm as he made to stand up — “after you’ve\\nbroken your first cup, would you be so kind as to\\nselect one of the blue patterned ones? I’m rather\\nattached to the pink.”\\nSure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf\\nof teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china.\\nProfessor Trelawney swept over to him holding a\\ndustpan and brush and said, “One of the blue ones,\\nthen, dear, if you wouldn’t mind ... thank you. ...”\\nWhen Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled,\\nthey went back to their table and tried to drink the\\nscalding tea quickly. They swilled the dregs around as\\nProfessor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the\\ncups and swapped over.\\n“Right,” said Ron as they both opened their books at\\npages five and six. “What can you see in mine?”\\n“A load of soggy brown stuff,” said Harry. The heavily\\nperfumed smoke in the room was making him feel\\nsleepy and stupid.\\n“Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes\\nto see past the mundane!” Professor Trelawney cried\\nthrough the gloom.\\n \\nHarry tried to pull himself together.\\n“Right, you’ve got a crooked sort of cross ...” He\\nconsulted Unfogging the Future. “That means you’re\\ngoing to have ‘trials and suffering’ — sorry about that\\n— but there’s a thing that could be the sun ... hang\\non ... that means ‘great happiness’ ... so you’re going\\nto suffer but be very happy. ...”\\n“You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,” said\\nRon, and they both had to stifle their laughs as\\nProfessor Trelawney gazed in their direction.\\n“My turn ...” Ron peered into Harry’s teacup, his\\nforehead wrinkled with effort. “There’s a blob a bit like\\na bowler hat,” he said. “Maybe you’re going to work\\nfor the Ministry of Magic. ...”\\nHe turned the teacup the other way up.\\n“But this way it looks more like an acorn. ... What’s\\nthat?” He scanned his copy of Unfogging the Future. “\\n‘A windfall, unexpected gold.’ Excellent, you can lend\\nme some ... and there’s a thing here,” he turned the\\ncup again, “that looks like an animal . . . yeah, if that\\nwas its head ... it looks like a hippo ... no, a sheep ...”\\nProfessor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a\\nsnort of laughter.\\n“Let me see that, my dear,” she said reprovingly to\\nRon, sweeping over and snatching Harry’s cup from\\nhim. Everyone went quiet to watch.\\nProfessor Trelawney was staring into the teacup,\\nrotating it counterclockwise.\\n“The falcon ... my dear, you have a deadly enemy.”\\n \\n“But everyone knows that,” said Hermione in a loud\\nwhisper. Professor Trelawney stared at her.\\n“Well, they do,” said Hermione. “Everybody knows\\nabout Harry and You-Know-Who.”\\nHarry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of\\namazement and admiration. They had never heard\\nHermione speak to a teacher like that before.\\nProfessor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered\\nher huge eyes to Harry’s cup again and continued to\\nturn it.\\n“The club ... an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy\\ncup. ...”\\n“I thought that was a bowler hat,” said Ron\\nsheepishly.\\n“The skull ... danger in your path, my dear. ...”\\nEveryone was staring, transfixed, at Professor\\nTrelawney, who gave the cup a final turn, gasped, and\\nthen screamed.\\nThere was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville\\nhad smashed his second cup. Professor Trelawney\\nsank into a vacant armchair, her glittering hand at\\nher heart and her eyes closed.\\n“My dear boy . . . my poor, dear boy ... no ... it is\\nkinder not to say ... no ... don’t ask me. ...”\\n“What is it, Professor?” said Dean Thomas at once.\\nEveryone had got to their feet, and slowly they\\ncrowded around Harry and Ron’s table, pressing close\\nto Professor Trelawney’s chair to get a good look at\\nHarry’s cup.\\n \\n“My dear,” Professor Trelawney’s huge eyes opened\\ndramatically, “you have the Grim.”\\n“The what?” said Harry.\\nHe could tell that he wasn’t the only one who didn’t\\nunderstand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him and\\nLavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody\\nelse clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.\\n“The Grim, my dear, the Grim!” cried Professor\\nTrelawney, who looked shocked that Harry hadn’t\\nunderstood. “The giant, spectral dog that haunts\\nchurchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen — the worst\\nomen — of death .!”\\nHarry’s stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of\\nDeath Omens in Flourish and Blotts — the dog in the\\nshadows of Magnolia Crescent . . . Lavender Brown\\nclapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was\\nlooking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had\\ngotten up and moved around to the back of Professor\\nTrelawney’s chair.\\n“I don’t think it looks like a Grim,” she said flatly.\\nProfessor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with\\nmounting dislike.\\n“You’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I\\nperceive very little aura around you. Very little\\nreceptivity to the resonances of the future.”\\nSeamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to\\nside.\\n“It looks like a Grim if you do this,” he said, with his\\neyes almost shut, “but it looks more like a donkey\\nfrom here,” he said, leaning to the left.\\n \\n“When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going\\nto die or not!” said Harry, taking even himself by\\nsurprise. Now nobody seemed to want to look at him.\\n“I think we will leave the lesson here for today,” said\\nProfessor Trelawney in her mistiest voice. “Yes ...\\nplease pack away your things. ...”\\nSilently the class took their teacups back to Professor\\nTrelawney, packed away their books, and closed their\\nbags. Even Ron was avoiding Harry’s eyes.\\n“Until we meet again,” said Professor Trelawney\\nfaintly, “fair fortune be yours. Oh, and dear” — she\\npointed at Neville — “you’ll be late next time, so mind\\nyou work extra-hard to catch up.”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor\\nTrelawney’s ladder and the winding stair in silence,\\nthen set off for Professor McGonagall’s\\nTransfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find\\nher classroom that, early as they had left Divination,\\nthey were only just in time.\\nHarry chose a seat right at the back of the room,\\nfeeling as though he were sitting in a very bright\\nspotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive\\nglances at him, as though he were about to drop dead\\nat any moment. He hardly heard what Professor\\nMcGonagall was telling them about Animagi (wizards\\nwho could transform at will into animals), and wasn’t\\neven watching when she transformed herself in front\\nof their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings\\naround her eyes.\\n“Really, what has got into you all today?” said\\nProfessor McGonagall, turning back into herself with\\na faint pop, and staring around at them all. “Not that\\n \\nit matters, but that’s the first time my\\ntransformation’s not got applause from a class.”\\nEverybody’s heads turned toward Harry again, but\\nnobody spoke. Then Hermione raised her hand.\\n“Please, Professor, we’ve just had our first Divination\\nclass, and we were reading the tea leaves, and — ”\\n“Ah, of course,” said Professor McGonagall, suddenly\\nfrowning. “There is no need to say any more, Miss\\nGranger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this\\nyear?”\\nEveryone stared at her.\\n“Me,” said Harry, finally.\\n“I see,” said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with\\nher beady eyes. “Then you should know, Potter, that\\nSibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one\\nstudent a year since she arrived at this school. None\\nof them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her\\nfavorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for\\nthe fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues — ”\\nProfessor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her\\nnostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly,\\n“Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of\\nmagic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very\\nlittle patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and\\nProfessor Trelawney — ”\\nShe stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-\\nfact tone, “You look in excellent health to me, Potter,\\nso you will excuse me if I don’t let you off homework\\ntoday. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand\\nit in.”\\n \\nHermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was\\nharder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away\\nfrom the dim red light and befuddling perfume of\\nProfessor Trelawney’s classroom. Not everyone was\\nconvinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and\\nLavender whispered, “But what about Neville’s cup?”\\nWhen the Transfiguration class had finished, they\\njoined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for\\nlunch.\\n“Ron, cheer up,” said Hermione, pushing a dish of\\nstew toward him. “You heard what Professor\\nMcGonagall said.”\\nRon spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his\\nfork but didn’t start.\\n“Harry,” he said, in a low, serious voice, “you haven’t\\nseen a great black dog anywhere, have you?”\\n“Yeah, I have,” said Harry. “I saw one the night I left\\nthe Dursleys’.”\\nRon let his fork fall with a clatter.\\n“Probably a stray,” said Hermione calmly.\\nRon looked at Hermione as though she had gone\\nmad.\\n“Hermione, if Harry’s seen a Grim, that’s — that’s\\nbad,” he said. “My — my uncle Bilius saw one and —\\nand he died twenty-four hours later!”\\n“Coincidence,” said Hermione airily, pouring herself\\nsome pumpkin juice.\\n \\n“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” said Ron,\\nstarting to get angry. “Grims scare the living daylights\\nout of most wizards!”\\n“There you are, then,” said Hermione in a superior\\ntone. “They see the Grim and die of fright. The Grim’s\\nnot an omen, it’s the cause of death! And Harry’s still\\nwith us because he’s not stupid enough to see one\\nand think, right, well, I’d better kick the bucket then!”\\nRon mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened\\nher bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and\\npropped it open against the juice jug.\\n“I think Divination seems very woolly,” she said,\\nsearching for her page. “A lot of guesswork, if you ask\\nme.”\\n“There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that\\ncup!” said Ron hotly.\\n“You didn’t seem quite so confident when you were\\ntelling Harry it was a sheep,” said Hermione coolly.\\n“Professor Trelawney said you didn’t have the right\\naura! You just don’t like being bad at something for a\\nchange!”\\nHe had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her\\nArithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits\\nof meat and carrot flew everywhere.\\n“If being good at Divination means I have to pretend\\nto see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I’m not\\nsure I’ll be studying it much longer! That lesson was\\nabsolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy\\nclass!”\\nShe snatched up her bag and stalked away.\\n \\nRon frowned after her.\\n“What’s she talking about?” he said to Harry. “She\\nhasn’t been to an Arithmancy class yet.”\\nHarry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch.\\nYesterday’s rain had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale\\ngray, and the grass was springy and damp underfoot\\nas they set off for their first ever Care of Magical\\nCreatures class.\\nRon and Hermione weren’t speaking to each other.\\nHarry walked beside them in silence as they went\\ndown the sloping lawns to Hagrid’s hut on the edge of\\nthe Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted\\nthree only-too-familiar backs ahead of them that he\\nrealized they must be having these lessons with the\\nSlytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe\\nand Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure\\nhe knew what they were talking about.\\nHagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut.\\nHe stood in his moleskin overcoat, with Fang the\\nboarhound at his heels, looking impatient to start.\\n“C’mon, now, get a move on!” he called as the class\\napproached. “Got a real treat for yeh today! Great\\nlesson cornin’ up! Everyone here? Right, follow me!”\\nFor one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid\\nwas going to lead them into the forest; Harry had had\\nenough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a\\nlifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge\\nof the trees, and five minutes later, they found\\nthemselves outside a kind of paddock. There was\\nnothing in there.\\n \\n“Everyone gather ’round the fence here!” he called.\\n“That’s it — make sure yeh can see — now, firs’ thing\\nyeh’ll want ter do is open yer books — ”\\n“How?” said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy.\\n“Eh?” said Hagrid.\\n“How do we open our books?” Malfoy repeated. He\\ntook out his copy of The Monster Book of Monsters,\\nwhich he had bound shut with a length of rope. Other\\npeople took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had\\nbelted their book shut; others had crammed them\\ninside tight bags or clamped them together with\\nbinder clips.\\n“Hasn’ — hasn’ anyone bin able ter open their\\nbooks?” said Hagrid, looking crestfallen.\\nThe class all shook their heads.\\n“Yeh’ve got ter stroke ’em,” said Hagrid, as though\\nthis was the most obvious thing in the world. “Look —\\nHe took Hermione’s copy and ripped off the Spellotape\\nthat bound it. The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a\\ngiant forefinger down its spine, and the book\\nshivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.\\n“Oh, how silly we’ve all been!” Malfoy sneered. “We\\nshould have stroked them! Why didn’t we guess!”\\n“I — I thought they were funny,” Hagrid said\\nuncertainly to Hermione.\\n“Oh, tremendously funny!” said Malfoy. “Really witty,\\ngiving us books that try and rip our hands off!”\\n \\n“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Hagrid was\\nlooking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid ’s first\\nlesson to be a success.\\n“Righ’ then,” said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his\\nthread, “so — so yeh’ve got yer books an’ — an’ —\\nnow yeh need the Magical Creatures. Yeah. So I’ll go\\nan’ get ’em. Hang on ...”\\nHe strode away from them into the forest and out of\\nsight.\\n“God, this place is going to the dogs,” said Malfoy\\nloudly. “That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a\\nfit when I tell him — ”\\n“Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry repeated.\\n“Careful, Potter, there’s a dementor behind you — ”\\n“Oooooooh!” squealed Lavender Brown, pointing\\ntoward the opposite side of the paddock.\\nTrotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre\\ncreatures Harry had ever seen. They had the bodies,\\nhind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs,\\nwings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles,\\nwith cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly\\norange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a\\nfoot long and deadly looking. Each of the beasts had a\\nthick leather collar around its neck, which was\\nattached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these\\nwere held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came\\njogging into the paddock behind the creatures.\\n“Gee up, there!” he roared, shaking the chains and\\nurging the creatures toward the fence where the class\\nstood. Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached\\nthem and tethered the creatures to the fence.\\n \\n“Hippogriffs!” Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at\\nthem. “Beau’iful, aren’ they?”\\nHarry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you\\ngot over the first shock of seeing something that was\\nhalf horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the\\nhippogriffs’ gleaming coats, changing smoothly from\\nfeather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy\\ngray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and\\ninky black.\\n“So,” said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and\\nbeaming around, “if yeh wan’ ter come a bit nearer — ”\\nNo one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione,\\nhowever, approached the fence cautiously.\\n“Now, firs’ thing yeh gotta know abou’ hippogriffs is,\\nthey’re proud,” said Hagrid. “Easily offended,\\nhippogriffs are. Don’t never insult one, ’cause it might\\nbe the last thing yeh do.”\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren’t listening; they\\nwere talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty\\nfeeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the\\nlesson.\\n“Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs’\\nmove,” Hagrid continued. “It’s polite, see? Yeh walk\\ntoward him, and yeh bow, an’ yeh wait. If he bows\\nback, yeh’re allowed ter touch him. If he doesn’ bow,\\nthen get away from him sharpish, ’cause those talons\\nhurt.\\n“Right — who wants ter go first?”\\nMost of the class backed farther away in answer.\\nEven Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings. The\\nhippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing\\n \\ntheir powerful wings; they didn’t seem to like being\\ntethered like this.\\n“No one?” said Hagrid, with a pleading look.\\n“I’ll do it,” said Harry.\\nThere was an intake of breath from behind him, and\\nboth Lavender and Parvati whispered, “Oooh, no,\\nHarry, remember your tea leaves!”\\nHarry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock\\nfence.\\n“Good man, Harry!” roared Hagrid. “Right then — let’s\\nsee how yeh get on with Buckbeak.”\\nHe untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff\\naway from its fellows, and slipped off its leather\\ncollar. The class on the other side of the paddock\\nseemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy’s eyes were\\nnarrowed maliciously.\\n“Easy, now, Harry,” said Hagrid quietly. “Yeh’ve got\\neye contact, now try not ter blink. ... Hippogriffs don’\\ntrust yeh if yeh blink too much. ...”\\nHarry’s eyes immediately began to water, but he\\ndidn’t shut them. Buckbeak had turned his great,\\nsharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce\\norange eye.\\n“Tha’s it,” said Hagrid. “Tha’s it, Harry ... now, bow\\nHarry didn’t feel much like exposing the back of his\\nneck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. He gave\\na short bow and then looked up.\\n \\nThe hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It\\ndidn’t move.\\n“Ah,” said Hagrid, sounding worried. “Right — back\\naway, now, Harry, easy does it — ”\\nBut then, to Harry’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff\\nsuddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into\\nwhat was an unmistakable bow.\\n“Well done, Harry!” said Hagrid, ecstatic. “Right —\\nyeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!”\\nFeeling that a better reward would have been to back\\naway, Harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and\\nreached out toward it. He patted the beak several\\ntimes and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as\\nthough enjoying it.\\nThe class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy,\\nCrabbe, and Goyle, who were looking deeply\\ndisappointed.\\n“Righ’ then, Harry,” said Hagrid. “I reckon he might’\\nlet yeh ride him!”\\nThis was more than Harry had bargained for. He was\\nused to a broomstick; but he wasn’t sure a hippogriff\\nwould be quite the same.\\n“Yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint,” said\\nHagrid, “an’ mind yeh don’ pull any of his feathers\\nout, he won’ like that. ...”\\nHarry put his foot on the top of Buckbeak’s wing and\\nhoisted himself onto its back. Buckbeak stood up.\\nHarry wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything in\\nfront of him was covered with feathers.\\n \\n“Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s\\nhindquarters.\\nWithout warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on\\neither side of Harry; he just had time to seize the\\nhippogriff around the neck before he was soaring\\nupward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry\\nknew which one he preferred; the hippogriff’s wings\\nbeat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching\\nhim under his legs and making him feel he was about\\nto be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his\\nfingers and he didn’t dare get a stronger grip; instead\\nof the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he\\nnow felt himself rocking backward and forward as the\\nhindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its\\nwings.\\nBuckbeak flew him once around the paddock and\\nthen headed back to the ground; this was the bit\\nHarry had been dreading; he leaned back as the\\nsmooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off\\nover the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-\\nassorted feet hit the ground. He just managed to hold\\non and push himself straight again.\\n“Good work, Harry!” roared Hagrid as everyone except\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. “Okay, who else\\nwants a go?”\\nEmboldened by Harry’s success, the rest of the class\\nclimbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied\\nthe hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were\\nbowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran\\nrepeatedly backward from his, which didn’t seem to\\nwant to bend its knees. Ron and Hermione practiced\\non the chestnut, while Harry watched.\\n \\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak.\\nHe had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his\\nbeak, looking disdainful.\\n“This is very easy,” Malfoy drawled, loud enough for\\nHarry to hear him. “I knew it must have been, if\\nPotter could do it. ... I bet you’re not dangerous at all,\\nare you?” he said to the hippogriff. “Are you, you great\\nugly brute?”\\nIt happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a\\nhigh-pitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was\\nwrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he\\nstrained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass,\\nblood blossoming over his robes.\\n“I’m dying!” Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. “I’m\\ndying, look at me! It’s killed me!”\\n“Yer not dyin’!” said Hagrid, who had gone very white.\\n“Someone help me — gotta get him outta here — ”\\nHermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted\\nMalfoy easily. As they passed, Harry saw that there\\nwas a long, deep gash on Malfoy’s arm; blood\\nsplattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the\\nslope toward the castle.\\nVery shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class\\nfollowed at a walk. The Slytherins were all shouting\\nabout Hagrid.\\n“They should fire him straight away!” said Pansy\\nParkinson, who was in tears.\\n“It was Malfoy’s fault!” snapped Dean Thomas.\\nCrabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly.\\n \\nThey all climbed the stone steps into the deserted\\nentrance hall.\\n“I’m going to see if he’s okay!” said Pansy, and they all\\nwatched her run up the marble staircase. The\\nSlytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away\\nin the direction of their dungeon common room;\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to\\nGryffindor Tower.\\n“D’you think he’ll be all right?” said Hermione\\nnervously.\\n“ ’Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in\\nabout a second,” said Harry, who had had far worse\\ninjuries mended magically by the nurse.\\n“That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid ’s\\nfirst class, though, wasn’t it?” said Ron, looking\\nworried. “Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him. ...”\\nThey were among the first to reach the Great Hall at\\ndinnertime, hoping to see Hagrid, but he wasn’t there.\\n“They wouldn’t fire him, would they?” said Hermione\\nanxiously, not touching her steak-and-kidney\\npudding.\\n“They’d better not,” said Ron, who wasn’t eating\\neither.\\nHarry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group\\nincluding Crabbe and Goyle was huddled together,\\ndeep in conversation. Harry was sure they were\\ncooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been\\ninjured.\\n“Well, you can’t say it wasn’t an interesting first day\\nback,” said Ron gloomily.\\n \\nThey went up to the crowded Gryffindor common\\nroom after dinner and tried to do the homework\\nProfessor McGonagall had given them, but all three of\\nthem kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower\\nwindow.\\n“There’s a light on in Hagrid’s window,” Harry said\\nsuddenly.\\nRon looked at his watch.\\n“If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It’s still\\nquite early. ...”\\n“I don’t know,” Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw\\nher glance at him.\\n“I’m allowed to walk across the grounds,” he said\\npointedly. “Sirius Black hasn’t got past the dementors\\nyet, has he?”\\nSo they put their things away and headed out of the\\nportrait hole, glad to meet nobody on their way to the\\nfront doors, as they weren’t entirely sure they were\\nsupposed to be out.\\nThe grass was still wet and looked almost black in the\\ntwilight. When they reached Hagrid’s hut, they\\nknocked, and a voice growled, “C’min.”\\nHagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed\\nwooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in\\nHagrid’s lap. One look told them that Hagrid had been\\ndrinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as\\nbig as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be\\nhaving difficulty getting them into focus.\\n \\n“ ’Spect it’s a record,” he said thickly, when he\\nrecognized them. “Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a\\nteacher who lasted on’y a day before.”\\n“You haven’t been fired, Hagrid!” gasped Hermione.\\n“Not yet,” said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp\\nof whatever was in the tankard. “But ’s only a matter\\no’ time, i’n’t it, after Malfoy ...”\\n“How is he?” said Ron as they all sat down. “It wasn’t\\nserious, was it?”\\n“Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,” said\\nHagrid dully, “but he’s sayin’ it’s still agony ... covered\\nin bandages ... moanin’ ...”\\n“He’s faking it,” said Harry at once. “Madam Pomfrey\\ncan mend anything. She regrew half my bones last\\nyear. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it’s worth.”\\n“School gov’nors have bin told, o’ course,” said Hagrid\\nmiserably. “They reckon I started too big. Shoulda left\\nhippogriffs fer later ... done flobberworms or summat.\\n... Jus’ thought it’d make a good firs’ lesson. ... ’S all\\nmy fault. ...”\\n“It’s all Malfoy ’s fault, Hagrid!” said Hermione\\nearnestly.\\n“We’re witnesses,” said Harry. “You said hippogriffs\\nattack if you insult them. It’s Malfoy’s problem that\\nhe wasn’t listening. We’ll tell Dumbledore what really\\nhappened.”\\n“Yeah, don’t worry, Hagrid, we’ll back you up,” said\\nRon.\\n \\nTears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid ’s\\nbeetle-black eyes. He grabbed both Harry and Ron\\nand pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.\\n“I think you’ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,” said\\nHermione firmly. She took the tankard from the table\\nand went outside to empty it.\\n“Ar, maybe she’s right,” said Hagrid, letting go of\\nHarry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing\\ntheir ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and\\nfollowed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a\\nloud splash.\\n“What’s he done?” said Harry nervously as Hermione\\ncame back in with the empty tankard.\\n“Stuck his head in the water barrel,” said Hermione,\\nputting the tankard away.\\nHagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping\\nwet, wiping the water out of his eyes.\\n“Tha’s better,” he said, shaking his head like a dog\\nand drenching them all. “Listen, it was good of yeh ter\\ncome an’ see me, I really — ”\\nHagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he’d\\nonly just realized he was there.\\n“WHAT DYEH THINK YOU’RE DOIN’, EH?” he roared,\\nso suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air.\\n“YEH ’RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN’ AROUND AFTER\\nDARK, HARRY! AN’ YOU TWO! LETTIN’ HIM!”\\nHagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and\\npulled him to the door.\\n \\n“C’mon!” Hagrid said angrily. “I’m takin’yer all back\\nup ter school, an’ don’ let me catch yeh walkin’ down\\nter see me after dark again. I’m not worth that!”\\n \\n7\\nTHE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE\\nMalfoy didn’t reappear in classes until late on\\nThursday morning, when the Slytherins and\\nGryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He\\nswaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in\\nbandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry’s\\nopinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of\\nsome dreadful battle.\\n“How is it, Draco?” simpered Pansy Parkinson. “Does\\nit hurt much?”\\n“Yeah,” said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of\\ngrimace. But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and\\nGoyle when Pansy had looked away.\\n“Settle down, settle down,” said Professor Snape idly.\\nHarry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn’t\\nhave said “settle down” if they’d walked in late, he’d\\nhave given them detention. But Malfoy had always\\nbeen able to get away with anything in Snape ’s\\n \\nclasses; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and\\ngenerally favored his own students above all others.\\nThey were making a new potion today, a Shrinking\\nSolution. Malfoy set up his cauldron right next to\\nHarry and Ron, so that they were preparing their\\ningredients on the same table.\\n“Sir,” Malfoy called, “sir, I’ll need help cutting up\\nthese daisy roots, because of my arm — ”\\n“Weasley, cut up Malfoy’s roots for him,” said Snape\\nwithout looking up.\\nRon went brick red.\\n“There’s nothing wrong with your arm,” he hissed at\\nMalfoy.\\nMalfoy smirked across the table.\\n“Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these\\nroots.”\\nRon seized his knife, pulled Malfoy’s roots toward\\nhim, and began to chop them roughly, so that they\\nwere all different sizes.\\n“Professor,” drawled Malfoy, “Weasley’s mutilating my\\nroots, sir.”\\nSnape approached their table, stared down his\\nhooked nose at the roots, then gave Ron an\\nunpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black\\nhair.\\n“Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.”\\n“But, sir — !”\\n \\nRon had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully\\nshredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.\\n“Now,” said Snape in his most dangerous voice.\\nRon shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the\\ntable at Malfoy, then took up the knife again.\\n“And, sir, 111 need this shrivelfig skinned,” said\\nMalfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter.\\n“Potter, you can skin Malfoy’s shrivelfig,” said Snape,\\ngiving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved\\njust for him.\\nHarry took Malfoy’s shrivelfig as Ron began trying to\\nrepair the damage to the roots he now had to use.\\nHarry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and\\nflung it back across the table at Malfoy without\\nspeaking. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than\\never.\\n“Seen your pal Hagrid lately?” he asked them quietly.\\n“None of your business,” said Ron jerkily, without\\nlooking up.\\n“I’m afraid he won’t be a teacher much longer,” said\\nMalfoy in a tone of mock sorrow. “Father’s not very\\nhappy about my injury — ”\\n“Keep talking, Malfoy, and I’ll give you a real injury,”\\nsnarled Ron.\\n“ — he’s complained to the school governors. And to\\nthe Ministry of Magic. Father’s got a lot of influence,\\nyou know. And a lasting injury like this” — he gave a\\nhuge, fake sigh — “who knows if my arm’ll ever be the\\nsame again?”\\n \\n“So that’s why you’re putting it on,” said Harry,\\naccidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his\\nhand was shaking in anger. “To try to get Hagrid\\nfired.”\\n“Well,” said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper,\\n“ partly , Potter. But there are other benefits too.\\nWeasley, slice my caterpillars for me.”\\nA few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville\\nregularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his\\nworst subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape\\nmade things ten times worse. His potion, which was\\nsupposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned —\\n“Orange, Longbottom,” said Snape, ladling some up\\nand allowing it to splash back into the cauldron, so\\nthat everyone could see. “Orange. Tell me, boy, does\\nanything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn’t\\nyou hear me say, quite clearly, that only one rat\\nspleen was needed? Didn’t I state plainly that a dash\\nof leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to\\nmake you understand, Longbottom?”\\nNeville was pink and trembling. He looked as though\\nhe was on the verge of tears.\\n“Please, sir,” said Hermione, “please, I could help\\nNeville put it right — ”\\n“I don’t remember asking you to show off, Miss\\nGranger,” said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as\\npink as Neville. “Longbottom, at the end of this lesson\\nwe will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad\\nand see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage\\nyou to do it properly.”\\nSnape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with\\nfear.\\n \\n“Help me!” he moaned to Hermione.\\n“Hey, Harry,” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to\\nborrow Harry’s brass scales, “have you heard? Daily\\nProphet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black’s\\nbeen sighted.”\\n“Where?” said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other\\nside of the table, Malfoy looked up, listening closely.\\n“Not too far from here,” said Seamus, who looked\\nexcited. “It was a Muggle who saw him. ’Course, she\\ndidn’t really understand. The Muggles think he’s just\\nan ordinary criminal, don’t they? So she phoned the\\ntelephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic\\ngot there, he was gone.”\\n“Not too far from here ... ,” Ron repeated, looking\\nsignificantly at Harry. He turned around and saw\\nMalfoy watching closely. “What, Malfoy? Need\\nsomething else skinned?”\\nBut Malfoy’s eyes were shining malevolently, and they\\nwere fixed on Harry. He leaned across the table.\\n“Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed,\\nPotter?”\\n“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry offhandedly.\\nMalfoy’s thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.\\n“Of course, if it was me,” he said quietly, “I’d have\\ndone something before now. I wouldn’t be staying in\\nschool like a good boy, I’d be out there looking for\\nhim.”\\n“What are you talking about, Malfoy?” said Ron\\nroughly.\\n \\n“Don’t you know, Potter?” breathed Malfoy, his pale\\neyes narrowed.\\n“Know what?”\\nMalfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.\\n“Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck,” he said.\\n“Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it\\nwas me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down myself.”\\n“ What are you talking about?” said Harry angrily, but\\nat that moment Snape called, “You should have\\nfinished adding your ingredients by now; this potion\\nneeds to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away\\nwhile it simmers and then we’ll test Longbottom’s. ...”\\nCrabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville\\nsweat as he stirred his potion feverishly. Hermione\\nwas muttering instructions to him out of the corner of\\nher mouth, so that Snape wouldn’t see. Harry and\\nRon packed away their unused ingredients and went\\nto wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in\\nthe corner.\\n“What did Malfoy mean?” Harry muttered to Ron as\\nhe stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from\\nthe gargoyle’s mouth. “Why would I want revenge on\\nBlack? He hasn’t done anything to me — yet.”\\n“He’s making it up,” said Ron savagely. “He’s trying to\\nmake you do something stupid. ...”\\nThe end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to\\nNeville, who was cowering by his cauldron.\\n“Everyone gather ’round,” said Snape, his black eyes\\nglittering, “and watch what happens to Longbottom’s\\ntoad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking\\n \\nSolution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don’t\\ndoubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be\\npoisoned.”\\nThe Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins\\nlooked excited. Snape picked up Trevor the toad in\\nhis left hand and dipped a small spoon into Neville’s\\npotion, which was now green. He trickled a few drops\\ndown Trevor’s throat.\\nThere was a moment of hushed silence, in which\\nTrevor gulped; then there was a small pop, and Trevor\\nthe tadpole was wriggling in Snape ’s palm.\\nThe Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking\\nsour, pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his\\nrobe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor, and he\\nreappeared suddenly, fully grown.\\n“Five points from Gryffindor,” said Snape, which\\nwiped the smiles from every face. “I told you not to\\nhelp him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the\\nentrance hall. Harry was still thinking about what\\nMalfoy had said, while Ron was seething about\\nSnape.\\n“Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was\\nall right! Why didn’t you lie, Hermione? You should’ve\\nsaid Neville did it all by himself!”\\nHermione didn’t answer. Ron looked around.\\n“Where is she?”\\nHarry turned too. They were at the top of the steps\\nnow, watching the rest of the class pass them,\\nheading for the Great Hall and lunch.\\n \\n“She was right behind us,” said Ron, frowning.\\nMalfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and\\nGoyle. He smirked at Harry and disappeared.\\n“There she is,” said Harry.\\nHermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the\\nstairs; one hand clutched her bag, the other seemed\\nto be tucking something down the front of her robes.\\n“How did you do that?” said Ron.\\n“What?” said Hermione, joining them.\\n“One minute you were right behind us, the next\\nmoment, you were back at the bottom of the stairs\\nagain.”\\n“What?” Hermione looked slightly confused. “Oh — I\\nhad to go back for something. Oh no — ”\\nA seam had split on Hermione’s bag. Harry wasn’t\\nsurprised; he could see that it was crammed with at\\nleast a dozen large and heavy books.\\n“Why are you carrying all these around with you?”\\nRon asked her.\\n“You know how many subjects I’m taking,” said\\nHermione breathlessly. “Couldn’t hold these for me,\\ncould you?”\\n“But — ” Ron was turning over the books she had\\nhanded him, looking at the covers. “You haven’t got\\nany of these subjects today. It’s only Defense Against\\nthe Dark Arts this afternoon.”\\n \\n“Oh yes,” said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all\\nthe books back into her bag just the same. “I hope\\nthere’s something good for lunch, I’m starving,” she\\nadded, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.\\n“D’you get the feeling Hermione ’s not telling us\\nsomething?” Ron asked Harry.\\nProfessor Lupin wasn’t there when they arrived at his\\nfirst Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all\\nsat down, took out their books, quills, and\\nparchment, and were talking when he finally entered\\nthe room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty\\nold briefcase on the teacher’s desk. He was as shabby\\nas ever but looked healthier than he had on the train,\\nas though he had had a few square meals.\\n“Good afternoon,” he said. “Would you please put all\\nyour books back in your bags. Today’s will be a\\npractical lesson. You will need only your wands.”\\nA few curious looks were exchanged as the class put\\naway their books. They had never had a practical\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts before, unless you\\ncounted the memorable class last year when their old\\nteacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and\\nset them loose.\\n“Right then,” said Professor Lupin, when everyone\\nwas ready. “If you’d follow me.”\\nPuzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and\\nfollowed Professor Lupin out of the classroom. He led\\nthem along the deserted corridor and around a\\ncorner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the\\nPoltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair\\nand stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum.\\n \\nPeeves didn’t look up until Professor Lupin was two\\nfeet away; then he wiggled his curly-toed feet and\\nbroke into song.\\n“Loony, loopy Lupin,” Peeves sang. “Loony, loopy\\nLupin, loony, loopy Lupin — ”\\nRude and unmanageable as he almost always was,\\nPeeves usually showed some respect toward the\\nteachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin\\nto see how he would take this; to their surprise, he\\nwas still smiling.\\n“I’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you,\\nPeeves,” he said pleasantly. “Mr. Filch won’t be able to\\nget in to his brooms.”\\nFilch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered,\\nfailed wizard who waged a constant war against the\\nstudents and, indeed, Peeves. However, Peeves paid\\nno attention to Professor Lupin’s words, except to\\nblow a loud wet raspberry.\\nProfessor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his\\nwand.\\n“This is a useful little spell,” he told the class over his\\nshoulder. “Please watch closely.”\\nHe raised the wand to shoulder height, said,\\n“ Waddiwasil ” and pointed it at Peeves.\\nWith the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum\\nshot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeves ’s left\\nnostril; he whirled upright and zoomed away, cursing.\\n“Cool, sir!” said Dean Thomas in amazement.\\n \\n“Thank you, Dean,” said Professor Lupin, putting his\\nwand away again. “Shall we proceed?”\\nThey set off again, the class looking at shabby\\nProfessor Lupin with increased respect. He led them\\ndown a second corridor and stopped, right outside the\\nstaffroom door.\\n“Inside, please,” said Professor Lupin, opening it and\\nstanding back.\\nThe staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old,\\nmismatched chairs, was empty except for one teacher.\\nProfessor Snape was sitting in a low armchair, and he\\nlooked around as the class filed in. His eyes were\\nglittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around\\nhis mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to\\nclose the door behind him, Snape said, “Leave it open,\\nLupin. Td rather not witness this.”\\nHe got to his feet and strode past the class, his black\\nrobes billowing behind him. At the doorway he turned\\non his heel and said, “Possibly no one’s warned you,\\nLupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I\\nwould advise you not to entrust him with anything\\ndifficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing\\ninstructions in his ear.”\\nNeville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad\\nenough that he bullied Neville in his own classes, let\\nalone doing it in front of other teachers.\\nProfessor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.\\n“I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the\\nfirst stage of the operation,” he said, “and I am sure\\nhe will perform it admirably.”\\n \\nNeville’s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape’s\\nlip curled, but he left, shutting the door with a snap.\\n“Now, then,” said Professor Lupin, beckoning the\\nclass toward the end of the room, where there was\\nnothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept\\ntheir spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand\\nnext to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble,\\nbanging off the wall.\\n“Nothing to worry about,” said Professor Lupin calmly\\nbecause a few people had jumped backward in alarm.\\n“There’s a boggart in there.”\\nMost people seemed to feel that this was something to\\nworry about. Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of\\npure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now\\nrattling doorknob apprehensively.\\n“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor\\nLupin. “Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the\\ncupboards under sinks — I’ve even met one that had\\nlodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in\\nyesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if\\nthe staff would leave it to give my third years some\\npractice.\\n“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what\\nis a boggart?”\\nHermione put up her hand.\\n“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape\\nof whatever it thinks will frighten us most.”\\n“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor\\nLupin, and Hermione glowed. “So the boggart sitting\\nin the darkness within has not yet assumed a form.\\nHe does not yet know what will frighten the person on\\n \\nthe other side of the door. Nobody knows what a\\nboggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let\\nhim out, he will immediately become whatever each of\\nus most fears.\\n“This means,” said Professor Lupin, choosing to\\nignore Neville’s small sputter of terror, “that we have a\\nhuge advantage over the boggart before we begin.\\nHave you spotted it, Harry?”\\nTrying to answer a question with Hermione next to\\nhim, bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet\\nwith her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but\\nHarry had a go.\\n“Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know\\nwhat shape it should be?”\\n“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put\\nher hand down, looking a little disappointed. “It’s\\nalways best to have company when you’re dealing\\nwith a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should\\nhe become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I\\nonce saw a boggart make that very mistake — tried to\\nfrighten two people at once and turned himself into\\nhalf a slug. Not remotely frightening.\\n“The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it\\nrequires force of mind. You see, the thing that really\\nfinishes a boggart is laughter. What you need to do is\\nforce it to assume a shape that you find amusing.\\n“We will practice the charm without wands first. After\\nme, please ... riddikulusV’\\n“ RiddikulusV’ said the class together.\\n“Good,” said Professor Lupin. “Very good. But that\\nwas the easy part, I’m afraid. You see, the word alone\\n \\nis not enough. And this is where you come in,\\nNeville.”\\nThe wardrobe shook again, though not as much as\\nNeville, who walked forward as though he were\\nheading for the gallows.\\n“Right, Neville,” said Professor Lupin. “First things\\nfirst: what would you say is the thing that frightens\\nyou most in the world?”\\nNeville’s lips moved, but no noise came out.\\n“Didn’t catch that, Neville, sorry,” said Professor\\nLupin cheerfully.\\nNeville looked around rather wildly, as though\\nbegging someone to help him, then said, in barely\\nmore than a whisper, “Professor Snape.”\\nNearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned\\napologetically. Professor Lupin, however, looked\\nthoughtful.\\n“Professor Snape ... hmmm ... Neville, I believe you\\nlive with your grandmother?”\\n“Er — yes,” said Neville nervously. “But — I don’t\\nwant the boggart to turn into her either.”\\n“No, no, you misunderstand me,” said Professor\\nLupin, now smiling. “I wonder, could you tell us what\\nsort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?”\\nNeville looked startled, but said, “Well ... always the\\nsame hat. A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top.\\nAnd a long dress ... green, normally ... and sometimes\\na fox-fur scarf.”\\n \\n“And a handbag?” prompted Professor Lupin.\\n“A big red one,” said Neville.\\n“Right then,” said Professor Lupin. “Can you picture\\nthose clothes very clearly, Neville? Can you see them\\nin your mind’s eye?”\\n“Yes,” said Neville uncertainly, plainly wondering\\nwhat was coming next.\\n“When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe,\\nNeville, and sees you, it will assume the form of\\nProfessor Snape,” said Lupin. “And you will raise your\\nwand — thus — and cry ‘Riddikulus’ — and\\nconcentrate hard on your grandmother’s clothes. If all\\ngoes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into\\nthat vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with\\nthat big red handbag.”\\nThere was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe\\nwobbled more violently.\\n“If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift\\nhis attention to each of us in turn,” said Professor\\nLupin. “I would like all of you to take a moment now\\nto think of the thing that scares you most, and\\nimagine how you might force it to look comical. ...”\\nThe room went quiet. Harry thought ... What scared\\nhim most in the world?\\nHis first thought was Lord Voldemort — a Voldemort\\nreturned to full strength. But before he had even\\nstarted to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart -\\nVoldemort, a horrible image came floating to the\\nsurface of his mind. ...\\n \\nA rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a\\nblack cloak ... a long, rattling breath from an unseen\\nmouth . . . then a cold so penetrating it felt like\\ndrowning. ...\\nHarry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one\\nhad noticed. Many people had their eyes shut tight.\\nRon was muttering to himself, “Take its legs off.”\\nHarry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron’s\\ngreatest fear was spiders.\\n“Everyone ready?” said Professor Lupin.\\nHarry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn’t ready. How could\\nyou make a dementor less frightening? But he didn’t\\nwant to ask for more time; everyone else was nodding\\nand rolling up their sleeves.\\n“Neville, we’re going to back away,” said Professor\\nLupin. “Let you have a clear field, all right? I’ll call the\\nnext person forward. ... Everyone back, now, so\\nNeville can get a clear shot — ”\\nThey all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving\\nNeville alone beside the wardrobe. He looked pale and\\nfrightened, but he had pushed up the sleeves of his\\nrobes and was holding his wand ready.\\n“On the count of three, Neville,” said Professor Lupin,\\nwho was pointing his own wand at the handle of the\\nwardrobe. “One — two — three — now\\\\”\\nA jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin’s\\nwand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst\\nopen. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape\\nstepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.\\n \\nNeville backed away, his wand up, mouthing\\nwordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him,\\nreaching inside his robes.\\n“R — r — riddikulusV’ squeaked Neville.\\nThere was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled;\\nhe was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a\\ntowering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and\\nhe was swinging a huge crimson handbag.\\nThere was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused,\\nconfused, and Professor Lupin shouted, “Parvati!\\nForward!”\\nParvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded\\non her. There was another crack, and where he had\\nstood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its\\nsightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to\\nwalk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff\\narms rising —\\n“RiddikulusV’ cried Parvati.\\nA bandage unraveled at the mummy’s feet; it became\\nentangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off.\\n“Seamus!” roared Professor Lupin.\\nSeamus darted past Parvati.\\nCrack ! Where the mummy had been was a woman\\nwith floor-length black hair and a skeletal, green-\\ntinged face — a banshee. She opened her mouth wide\\nand an unearthly sound filled the room, a long,\\nwailing shriek that made the hair on Harry’s head\\nstand on end —\\n“RiddikulusV’ shouted Seamus.\\n \\nThe banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her\\nthroat; her voice was gone.\\nCrack). The banshee turned into a rat, which chased\\nits tail in a circle, then — crack). — became a\\nrattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before —\\ncrack ! — becoming a single, bloody eyeball.\\n“It’s confused!” shouted Lupin. “We’re getting there!\\nDean!”\\nDean hurried forward.\\nCrack) The eyeball became a severed hand, which\\nflipped over and began to creep along the floor like a\\ncrab.\\n“RiddikulusV’ yelled Dean.\\nThere was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a\\nmousetrap.\\n“Excellent! Ron, you next!”\\nRon leapt forward.\\nCrack)\\nQuite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet\\ntall and covered in hair, was advancing on Ron,\\nclicking its pincers menacingly. For a moment, Harry\\nthought Ron had frozen. Then —\\n“RiddikulusV’ bellowed Ron, and the spider’s legs\\nvanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender Brown\\nsquealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt\\nat Harry’s feet. He raised his wand, ready, but —\\n \\n“Here!” shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying\\nforward.\\nCrack).\\nThe legless spider had vanished. For a second,\\neveryone looked wildly around to see where it was.\\nThen they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air\\nin front of Lupin, who said, “RiddikulusV’ almost\\nlazily.\\nCrack !\\n“Forward, Neville, and finish him off!” said Lupin as\\nthe boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach. Crack).\\nSnape was back. This time Neville charged forward\\nlooking determined.\\n“RiddikulusV’ he shouted, and they had a split\\nsecond’s view of Snape in his lacy dress before Neville\\nlet out a great “Ha!” of laughter, and the boggart\\nexploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke,\\nand was gone.\\n“Excellent!” cried Professor Lupin as the class broke\\ninto applause. “Excellent, Neville. Well done,\\neveryone. ... Let me see ... five points to Gryffindor for\\nevery person to tackle the boggart — ten for Neville\\nbecause he did it twice . . . and five each to Hermione\\nand Harry.”\\n“But I didn’t do anything,” said Harry.\\n“You and Hermione answered my questions correctly\\nat the start of the class, Harry,” Lupin said lightly.\\n“Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. Homework,\\nkindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it\\nfor me ... to be handed in on Monday. That will be\\nall.”\\n \\nTalking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry,\\nhowever, wasn’t feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had\\ndeliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart.\\nWhy? Was it because he’d seen Harry collapse on the\\ntrain, and thought he wasn’t up to much? Had he\\nthought Harry would pass out again?\\nBut no one else seemed to have noticed anything.\\n“Did you see me take that banshee?” shouted\\nSeamus.\\n“And the hand!” said Dean, waving his own around.\\n“And Snape in that hat!”\\n“And my mummy!”\\n“I wonder why Professor Lupin’s frightened of crystal\\nballs?” said Lavender thoughtfully.\\n“That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts\\nlesson we’ve ever had, wasn’t it?” said Ron excitedly\\nas they made their way back to the classroom to get\\ntheir bags.\\n“He seems like a very good teacher,” said Hermione\\napprovingly. “But I wish I could have had a turn with\\nthe boggart — ”\\n“What would it have been for you?” said Ron,\\nsniggering. “A piece of homework that only got nine\\nout of ten?”\\n \\nd\\nFLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY\\nIn no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had\\nbecome most people’s favorite class. Only Draco\\nMalfoy and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to\\nsay about Professor Lupin.\\n“Look at the state of his robes,” Malfoy would say in a\\nloud whisper as Professor Lupin passed. “He dresses\\nlike our old house-elf.”\\nBut no one else cared that Professor Lupin’s robes\\nwere patched and frayed. His next few lessons were\\njust as interesting as the first. After boggarts, they\\nstudied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures\\nthat lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in\\nthe dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted\\nbattlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten\\nlost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy\\nwater-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with\\nwebbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in\\ntheir ponds.\\nHarry only wished he was as happy with some of his\\nother classes. Worst of all was Potions. Snape was in\\n \\na particularly vindictive mood these days, and no one\\nwas in any doubt why. The story of the boggart\\nassuming Snape’s shape, and the way that Neville\\nhad dressed it in his grandmother’s clothes, had\\ntraveled through the school like wildfire. Snape didn’t\\nseem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at\\nthe very mention of Professor Lupin’s name, and he\\nwas bullying Neville worse than ever.\\nHarry was also growing to dread the hours he spent\\nin Professor Trelawney’s stifling tower room,\\ndeciphering lopsided shapes and symbols, trying to\\nignore the way Professor Trelawney’s enormous eyes\\nfilled with tears every time she looked at him. He\\ncouldn’t like Professor Trelawney, even though she\\nwas treated with respect bordering on reverence by\\nmany of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown\\nhad taken to haunting Professor Trelawney’s tower\\nroom at lunchtimes, and always returned with\\nannoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though\\nthey knew things the others didn’t. They had also\\nstarted using hushed voices whenever they spoke to\\nHarry, as though he were on his deathbed.\\nNobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which,\\nafter the action-packed first class, had become\\nextremely dull. Hagrid seemed to have lost his\\nconfidence. They were now spending lesson after\\nlesson learning how to look after flobberworms, which\\nhad to be some of the most boring creatures in\\nexistence.\\n“Why would anyone bother looking after them?” said\\nRon, after yet another hour of poking shredded\\nlettuce down the flobberworms’ slimy throats.\\nAt the start of October, however, Harry had\\nsomething else to occupy him, something so enjoyable\\nit more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes.\\n \\nThe Quidditch season was approaching, and Oliver\\nWood, Captain of the Gryffindor team, called a\\nmeeting one Thursday evening to discuss tactics for\\nthe new season.\\nThere were seven people on a Quidditch team: three\\nChasers, whose job it was to score goals by putting\\nthe Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball) through one of\\nthe fifty-foot-high hoops at each end of the field; two\\nBeaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel\\nthe Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed\\naround trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who\\ndefended the goal posts, and the Seeker, who had the\\nhardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch,\\na tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture\\nended the game and earned the Seeker’s team an\\nextra one hundred and fifty points.\\nOliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in\\nhis seventh and final year at Hogwarts. There was a\\nquiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed\\nhis six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms\\non the edge of the darkening Quidditch field.\\n“This is our last chance — my last chance — to win\\nthe Quidditch Cup,” he told them, striding up and\\ndown in front of them. “I’ll be leaving at the end of\\nthis year. I’ll never get another shot at it.\\n“Gryffindor hasn’t won for seven years now. Okay, so\\nwe’ve had the worst luck in the world — injuries —\\nthen the tournament getting called off last year. ...”\\nWood swallowed, as though the memory still brought\\na lump to his throat. “But we also know we’ve got the\\nbest — ruddy — team — in — the — school,” he said,\\npunching a fist into his other hand, the old manic\\nglint back in his eye.\\n“We’ve got three superb Chasers.”\\n \\nWood pointed at Alicia Spinnet, Angelina Johnson,\\nand Katie Bell.\\n“We’ve got two unbeatable Beaters.”\\n“Stop it, Oliver, you’re embarrassing us,” said Fred\\nand George Weasley together, pretending to blush.\\n“And we’ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win\\nus a match).” Wood rumbled, glaring at Harry with a\\nkind of furious pride. “And me,” he added as an\\nafterthought.\\n“We think you’re very good too, Oliver,” said George.\\n“Spanking good Keeper,” said Fred.\\n“The point is,” Wood went on, resuming his pacing,\\n“the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it\\nthese last two years. Ever since Harry joined the\\nteam, I’ve thought the thing was in the bag. But we\\nhaven’t got it, and this year’s the last chance we’ll get\\nto finally see our name on the thing. ...”\\nWood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George\\nlooked sympathetic.\\n“Oliver, this year’s our year,” said Fred.\\n“Well do it, Oliver!” said Angelina.\\n“Definitely,” said Harry.\\nFull of determination, the team started training\\nsessions, three evenings a week. The weather was\\ngetting colder and wetter, the nights darker, but no\\namount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry’s\\nwonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver\\nQuidditch Cup.\\n \\nHarry returned to the Gryffindor common room one\\nevening after training, cold and stiff but pleased with\\nthe way practice had gone, to find the room buzzing\\nexcitedly.\\n“What’s happened?” he asked Ron and Hermione,\\nwho were sitting in two of the best chairs by the\\nfireside and completing some star charts for\\nAstronomy.\\n“First Hogsmeade weekend,” said Ron, pointing at a\\nnotice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin\\nboard. “End of October. Halloween.”\\n“Excellent,” said Fred, who had followed Harry\\nthrough the portrait hole. “I need to visit Zonko’s. I’m\\nnearly out of Stink Pellets.”\\nHarry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high\\nspirits ebbing away. Hermione seemed to read his\\nmind.\\n“Harry, I’m sure you’ll be able to go next time,” she\\nsaid. “They’re bound to catch Black soon. He’s been\\nsighted once already”\\n“Black’s not fool enough to try anything in\\nHogsmeade,” said Ron. “Ask McGonagall if you can go\\nthis time, Harry. The next one might not be for ages\\n“Ron\\\\” said Hermione. “Harry’s supposed to stay in\\nschool — ”\\n“He can’t be the only third year left behind,” said Ron.\\n“Ask McGonagall, go on, Harry — ”\\n“Yeah, I think I will,” said Harry, making up his mind.\\n \\nHermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that\\nmoment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap. A\\nlarge, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.\\n“Does he have to eat that in front of us?” said Ron,\\nscowling.\\n“Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by\\nyourself?” said Hermione.\\nCrookshanks slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow\\neyes fixed insolently on Ron.\\n“Just keep him over there, that’s all,” said Ron\\nirritably, turning back to his star chart. “I’ve got\\nScabbers asleep in my bag.”\\nHarry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he\\nstill had his own star chart to complete. He pulled his\\nbag toward him, took out parchment, ink, and quill,\\nand started work.\\n“You can copy mine, if you like,” said Ron, labeling\\nhis last star with a flourish and shoving the chart\\ntoward Harry.\\nHermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her\\nlips but didn’t say anything. Crookshanks was still\\nstaring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking the end of his\\nbushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced.\\n“OY!” Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks\\nsank four sets of claws deep inside it and began\\ntearing ferociously. “GET OFF, YOU STUPID ANIMAL!”\\nRon tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but\\nCrookshanks clung on, spitting and slashing.\\n \\n“Ron, don’t hurt him!” squealed Hermione; the whole\\ncommon room was watching; Ron whirled the bag\\naround, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers\\ncame flying out of the top —\\n“CATCH THAT CAT!” Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed\\nhimself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the\\ntable, and chased after the terrified Scabbers.\\nGeorge Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but\\nmissed; Scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of\\nlegs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers.\\nCrookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his\\nbandy legs, and started making furious swipes\\nbeneath it with his front paw.\\nRon and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed\\nCrookshanks around the middle and heaved him\\naway; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, with\\ngreat difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.\\n“Look at him!” he said furiously to Hermione,\\ndangling Scabbers in front of her. “He’s skin and\\nbone! You keep that cat away from him!”\\n“Crookshanks doesn’t understand it’s wrong!” said\\nHermione, her voice shaking. “All cats chase rats,\\nRon!”\\n“There’s something funny about that animal!” said\\nRon, who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling\\nScabbers back into his pocket. “It heard me say that\\nScabbers was in my bag!”\\n“Oh, what rubbish,” said Hermione impatiently.\\n“Crookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else d’you\\nthink — ”\\n \\n“That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said Ron, ignoring\\nthe people around him, who were starting to giggle.\\n“And Scabbers was here first, and he’s ill!”\\nRon marched through the common room and out of\\nsight up the stairs to the boys’ dormitories.\\nRon was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day.\\nHe barely talked to her all through Herbology, even\\nthough he, Harry, and Hermione were working\\ntogether on the same puffapod.\\n“How’s Scabbers?” Hermione asked timidly as they\\nstripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied\\nthe shining beans into a wooden pail.\\n“He’s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking,” said\\nRon angrily, missing the pail and scattering beans\\nover the greenhouse floor.\\n“Careful, Weasley, careful!” cried Professor Sprout as\\nthe beans burst into bloom before their very eyes.\\nThey had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had\\nresolved to ask Professor McGonagall after the lesson\\nwhether he could go into Hogsmeade with the rest,\\njoined the line outside the class trying to decide how\\nhe was going to argue his case. He was distracted,\\nhowever, by a disturbance at the front of the line.\\nLavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her\\narm around her and was explaining something to\\nSeamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were\\nlooking very serious.\\n“What’s the matter, Lavender?” said Hermione\\nanxiously as she, Harry, and Ron went to join the\\ngroup.\\n \\n“She got a letter from home this morning,” Parvati\\nwhispered. “It’s her rabbit, Binky. He’s been killed by\\na fox.”\\n“Oh,” said Hermione, “I’m sorry, Lavender.”\\n“I should have known!” said Lavender tragically. “You\\nknow what day it is?”\\n“Er — ”\\n“The sixteenth of October! That thing you’re dreading,\\nit will happen on the sixteenth of October!’\\nRemember? She was right, she was right!”\\nThe whole class was gathered around Lavender now.\\nSeamus shook his head seriously. Hermione\\nhesitated; then she said, “You — you were dreading\\nBinky being killed by a fox?”\\n“Well, not necessarily by a fox,” said Lavender,\\nlooking up at Hermione with streaming eyes, “but I\\nwas obviously dreading him dying, wasn’t I?”\\n“Oh,” said Hermione. She paused again. Then —\\n“Was Binky an old rabbit?”\\n“N — no!” sobbed Lavender. “H — he was only a\\nbaby!”\\nParvati tightened her arm around Lavender’s\\nshoulders.\\n“But then, why would you dread him dying?” said\\nHermione.\\nParvati glared at her.\\n \\n“Well, look at it logically,” said Hermione, turning to\\nthe rest of the group. “I mean, Binky didn’t even die\\ntoday, did he? Lavender just got the news today — ”\\nLavender wailed loudly. “ — and she can’t have been\\ndreading it, because it’s come as a real shock — ”\\n“Don’t mind Hermione, Lavender,” said Ron loudly,\\n“she doesn’t think other people’s pets matter very\\nmuch.”\\nProfessor McGonagall opened the classroom door at\\nthat moment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione\\nand Ron were looking daggers at each other, and\\nwhen they got into class, they seated themselves on\\neither side of Harry and didn’t talk to each other for\\nthe whole class.\\nHarry still hadn’t decided what he was going to say to\\nProfessor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of\\nthe lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject\\nof Hogsmeade first.\\n“One moment, please!” she called as the class made\\nto leave. “As you’re all in my House, you should hand\\nHogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween.\\nNo form, no visiting the village, so don’t forget!”\\nNeville put up his hand.\\n“Please, Professor, I — I think I’ve lost — ”\\n“Your grandmother sent yours to me directly,\\nLongbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “She\\nseemed to think it was safer. Well, that’s all, you may\\nleave.”\\n“Ask her now,” Ron hissed at Harry.\\n“Oh, but — ” Hermione began.\\n \\n“Go for it, Harry,” said Ron stubbornly.\\nHarry waited for the rest of the class to disappear,\\nthen headed nervously for Professor McGonagall’s\\ndesk.\\n“Yes, Potter?”\\nHarry took a deep breath.\\n“Professor, my aunt and uncle — er — forgot to sign\\nmy form,” he said.\\nProfessor McGonagall looked over her square\\nspectacles at him but didn’t say anything.\\n“So — er — d’you think it would be all right — I\\nmean, will it be okay if I — if I go to Hogsmeade?”\\nProfessor McGonagall looked down and began\\nshuffling papers on her desk.\\n“I’m afraid not, Potter,” she said. “You heard what I\\nsaid. No form, no visiting the village. That’s the rule.”\\n“But — Professor, my aunt and uncle — you know,\\nthey’re Muggles, they don’t really understand about\\n— about Hogwarts forms and stuff,” Harry said, while\\nRon egged him on with vigorous nods. “If you said I\\ncould go — ”\\n“But I don’t say so,” said Professor McGonagall,\\nstanding up and piling her papers neatly into a\\ndrawer. “The form clearly states that the parent or\\nguardian must give permission.” She turned to look at\\nhim, with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity?\\n“I’m sorry, Potter, but that’s my final word. You had\\nbetter hurry, or you’ll be late for your next lesson.”\\n \\nThere was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor\\nMcGonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed\\nHermione; Hermione assumed an “all-for-the-best”\\nexpression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry\\nhad to endure everyone in the class talking loudly\\nand happily about what they were going to do first,\\nonce they got into Hogsmeade.\\n“There’s always the feast,” said Ron, in an effort to\\ncheer Harry up. “You know, the Halloween feast, in\\nthe evening.”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry gloomily, “great.”\\nThe Halloween feast was always good, but it would\\ntaste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in\\nHogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing anyone said\\nmade him feel any better about being left behind.\\nDean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered\\nto forge Uncle Vernon’s signature on the form, but as\\nHarry had already told Professor McGonagall he\\nhadn’t had it signed, that was no good. Ron\\nhalfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but\\nHermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what\\nDumbledore had told them about the dementors\\nbeing able to see through them. Percy had what were\\npossibly the least helpful words of comfort.\\n“They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure\\nyou, Harry, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be,” he said\\nseriously. “All right, the sweetshop’s rather good, and\\nZonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dangerous, and yes, the\\nShrieking Shack’s always worth a visit, but really,\\nHarry, apart from that, you’re not missing anything.”\\nOn Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest\\nand went down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly\\ndepressed, though doing his best to act normally.\\n \\n“Well bring you lots of sweets back from\\nHoneydukes,” said Hermione, looking desperately\\nsorry for him.\\n“Yeah, loads,” said Ron. He and Hermione had finally\\nforgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the\\nface of Harry’s difficulties.\\n“Don’t worry about me,” said Harry, in what he hoped\\nwas an offhand voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a\\ngood time.”\\nHe accompanied them to the entrance hall, where\\nFilch, the caretaker, was standing inside the front\\ndoors, checking off names against a long list, peering\\nsuspiciously into every face, and making sure that no\\none was sneaking out who shouldn’t be going.\\n“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was\\nstanding in line with Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of\\npassing the dementors?”\\nHarry ignored him and made his solitary way up the\\nmarble staircase, through the deserted corridors, and\\nback to Gryffindor Tower.\\n“Password?” said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.\\n“Fortuna Major,” said Harry listlessly.\\nThe portrait swung open and he climbed through the\\nhole into the common room. It was full of chattering\\nfirst and second years, and a few older students, who\\nhad obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty\\nhad worn off.\\n“Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!”\\n \\nIt was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in\\nawe of Harry and never missed an opportunity to\\nspeak to him.\\n“Aren’t you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not?\\nHey” — Colin looked eagerly around at his friends —\\n“you can come and sit with us, if you like, Harry!”\\n“Er — no, thanks, Colin,” said Harry, who wasn’t in\\nthe mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the\\nscar on his forehead. “I — I’ve got to go to the library,\\ngot to get some work done.”\\nAfter that, he had no choice but to turn right around\\nand head back out of the portrait hole again.\\n“What was the point waking me up?” the Fat Lady\\ncalled grumpily after him as he walked away.\\nHarry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but\\nhalfway there he changed his mind; he didn’t feel like\\nworking. He turned around and came face-to-face\\nwith Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of\\nthe Hogsmeade visitors.\\n“What are you doing?” Filch snarled suspiciously.\\n“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully.\\n“Nothing!” spat Filch, his jowls quivering\\nunpleasantly. “A likely story! Sneaking around on\\nyour own — why aren’t you in Hogsmeade buying\\nStink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms\\nlike the rest of your nasty little friends?”\\nHarry shrugged.\\n \\n“Well, get back to your common room where you\\nbelong!” snapped Filch, and he stood glaring until\\nHarry had passed out of sight.\\nBut Harry didn’t go back to the common room; he\\nclimbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the\\nOwlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another\\ncorridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms\\nsaid, “Harry?”\\nHarry doubled back to see who had spoken and met\\nProfessor Lupin, looking around his office door.\\n“What are you doing?” said Lupin, though in a very\\ndifferent voice from Filch. “Where are Ron and\\nHermione?”\\n“Hogsmeade,” said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.\\n“Ah,” said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment.\\n“Why don’t you come in? I’ve just taken delivery of a\\ngrindylow for our next lesson.”\\n“A what?” said Harry.\\nHe followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a\\nvery large tank of water. A sickly green creature with\\nsharp little horns had its face pressed against the\\nglass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly\\nfingers.\\n“Water demon,” said Lupin, surveying the grindylow\\nthoughtfully. “We shouldn’t have much difficulty with\\nhim, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his\\ngrip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong,\\nbut very brittle.”\\nThe grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried\\nitself in a tangle of weeds in a corner.\\n \\n“Cup of tea?” Lupin said, looking around for his\\nkettle. “I was just thinking of making one.”\\n“All right,” said Harry awkwardly.\\nLupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of\\nsteam issued suddenly from the spout.\\n“Sit down,” said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin.\\n“I’ve only got teabags, I’m afraid — but I daresay\\nyou’ve had enough of tea leaves?”\\nHarry looked at him. Lupin’s eyes were twinkling.\\n“How did you know about that?” Harry asked.\\n“Professor McGonagall told me,” said Lupin, passing\\nHarry a chipped mug of tea. “You’re not worried, are\\nyou?”\\n“No,” said Harry.\\nHe thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the\\ndog he’d seen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not\\nto. He didn’t want Lupin to think he was a coward,\\nespecially since Lupin already seemed to think he\\ncouldn’t cope with a boggart.\\nSomething of Harry’s thoughts seemed to have shown\\non his face, because Lupin said, “Anything worrying\\nyou, Harry?”\\n“No,” Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched\\nthe grindylow brandishing a fist at him. “Yes,” he said\\nsuddenly, putting his tea down on Lupin’s desk. “You\\nknow that day we fought the boggart?\\n“Yes,” said Lupin slowly.\\n \\n“Why didn’t you let me fight it?” said Harry abruptly.\\nLupin raised his eyebrows.\\n“I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,” he\\nsaid, sounding surprised.\\nHarry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he’d\\ndone any such thing, was taken aback.\\n“Why?” he said again.\\n“Well,” said Lupin, frowning slightly, “I assumed that\\nif the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of\\nLord Voldemort.”\\nHarry stared. Not only was this the last answer he’d\\nexpected, but Lupin had said Voldemort ’s name. The\\nonly person Harry had ever heard say the name aloud\\n(apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.\\n“Clearly, I was wrong,” said Lupin, still frowning at\\nHarry. “But I didn’t think it a good idea for Lord\\nVoldemort to materialize in the staffroom. I imagined\\nthat people would panic.”\\n“I didn’t think of Voldemort,” said Harry honestly. “I\\n— I remembered those dementors.”\\n“I see,” said Lupin thoughtfully. “Well, well ... I’m\\nimpressed.” He smiled slightly at the look of surprise\\non Harry’s face. “That suggests that what you fear\\nmost of all is — fear. Very wise, Harry.”\\nHarry didn’t know what to say to that, so he drank\\nsome more tea.\\n“So you’ve been thinking that I didn’t believe you\\ncapable of fighting the boggart?” said Lupin shrewdly.\\n \\n“Well ... yeah,” said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a\\nlot happier. “Professor Lupin, you know the\\ndementors — ”\\nHe was interrupted by a knock on the door.\\n“Come in,” called Lupin.\\nThe door opened, and in came Snape. He was\\ncarrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and\\nstopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes\\nnarrowing.\\n“Ah, Severus,” said Lupin, smiling. “Thanks very\\nmuch. Could you leave it here on the desk for me?”\\nSnape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes\\nwandering between Harry and Lupin.\\n“I was just showing Harry my grindylow,” said Lupin\\npleasantly, pointing at the tank.\\n“Fascinating,” said Snape, without looking at it. “You\\nshould drink that directly, Lupin.”\\n“Yes, yes, I will,” said Lupin.\\n“I made an entire cauldronful,” Snape continued. “If\\nyou need more.”\\n“I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks\\nvery much, Severus.”\\n“Not at all,” said Snape, but there was a look in his\\neye Harry didn’t like. He backed out of the room,\\nunsmiling and watchful.\\nHarry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled.\\n \\n“Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion\\nfor me,” he said. “I have never been much of a potion-\\nbrewer and this one is particularly complex.” He\\npicked up the goblet and sniffed it. “Pity sugar makes\\nit useless,” he added, taking a sip and shuddering.\\n“Why — ?” Harry began. Lupin looked at him and\\nanswered the unfinished question.\\n“I’ve been feeling a bit off-color,” he said. “This potion\\nis the only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be\\nworking alongside Professor Snape; there aren’t many\\nwizards who are up to making it.”\\nProfessor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a\\ncrazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands.\\n“Professor Snape’s very interested in the Dark Arts,”\\nhe blurted out.\\n“Really?” said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as\\nhe took another gulp of potion.\\n“Some people reckon — ” Harry hesitated, then\\nplunged recklessly on, “some people reckon he’d do\\nanything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts\\njob.”\\nLupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.\\n“Disgusting,” he said. “Well, Harry, I’d better get back\\nto work. I’ll see you at the feast later.”\\n“Right,” said Harry, putting down his empty teacup.\\nThe empty goblet was still smoking.\\n“There you go,” said Ron. “We got as much as we\\ncould carry.”\\n \\nA shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry’s\\nlap. It was dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just\\nturned up in the common room, pink-faced from the\\ncold wind and looking as though they’d had the time\\nof their lives.\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny\\nblack Pepper Imps. “What’s Hogsmeade like? Where\\ndid you go?”\\nBy the sound of it — everywhere. Dervish and\\nBanges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko’s Joke\\nShop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of\\nhot butterbeer, and many places besides.\\n“The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all\\nsitting on shelves, all color-coded depending on how\\nfast you want your letter to get there!”\\n“Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were\\ngiving out free samples, there’s a bit, look — ”\\n“We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts\\nat the Three Broomsticks — ”\\n“Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer,\\nreally warms you up — ”\\n“What did you do?” said Hermione, looking anxious.\\n“Did you get any work done?”\\n“No,” said Harry. “Lupin made me a cup of tea in his\\noffice. And then Snape came in. ...”\\nHe told them all about the goblet. Ron’s mouth fell\\nopen.\\n“ Lupin drank it?” he gasped. “Is he mad?”\\n \\nHermione checked her watch.\\n“We’d better go down, you know, the feast’ll be\\nstarting in five minutes. ...” They hurried through the\\nportrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing\\nSnape.\\n“But if he — you know” — Hermione dropped her\\nvoice, glancing nervously around — “if he was trying\\nto — to poison Lupin — he wouldn’t have done it in\\nfront of Harry.”\\n“Yeah, maybe,” said Harry as they reached the\\nentrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall. It had\\nbeen decorated with hundreds and hundreds of\\ncandle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats,\\nand many flaming orange streamers, which were\\nswimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant\\nwatersnakes.\\nThe food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who\\nwere full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets,\\nmanaged second helpings of everything. Harry kept\\nglancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin looked\\ncheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking\\nanimatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the\\nCharms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the\\ntable, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining\\nit, or were Snape ’s eyes flickering toward Lupin more\\noften than was natural?\\nThe feast finished with an entertainment provided by\\nthe Hogwarts ghosts. They popped out of the walls\\nand tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly\\nHeadless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great\\nsuccess with a reenactment of his own botched\\nbeheading.\\n \\nIt had been such a pleasant evening that Harry’s good\\nmood couldn’t even be spoiled by Malfoy, who\\nshouted through the crowd as they all left the hall,\\n“The dementors send their love, Potter!”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the\\nGryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower,\\nbut when they reached the corridor that ended with\\nthe portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed\\nwith students.\\n“Why isn’t anyone going in?” said Ron curiously.\\nHarry peered over the heads in front of him. The\\nportrait seemed to be closed.\\n“Let me through, please,” came Percy’s voice, and he\\ncame bustling importantly through the crowd.\\n“What’s the holdup here? You can’t all have forgotten\\nthe password — excuse me, I’m Head Boy — ”\\nAnd then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front\\nfirst, so that a chill seemed to spread down the\\ncorridor. They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp\\nvoice, “Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.”\\nPeople’s heads turned; those at the back were\\nstanding on tiptoe.\\n“What’s going on?” said Ginny, who had just arrived.\\nA moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there,\\nsweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors\\nsqueezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble\\nwas.\\n“Oh, my — ” Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm.\\n \\nThe Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which\\nhad been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas\\nlittered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn\\naway completely.\\nDumbledore took one quick look at the ruined\\npainting and turned, his eyes somber, to see\\nProfessors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying\\ntoward him.\\n“We need to find her,” said Dumbledore. “Professor\\nMcGonagall, please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell\\nhim to search every painting in the castle for the Fat\\nLady.”\\n“You’ll be lucky!” said a cackling voice.\\nIt was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd\\nand looking delighted, as he always did, at the sight\\nof wreckage or worry.\\n“What do you mean, Peeves?” said Dumbledore\\ncalmly, and Peeves’s grin faded a little. He didn’t dare\\ntaunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an oily voice\\nthat was no better than his cackle.\\n“Ashamed, Your Headship, sir. Doesn’t want to be\\nseen. She’s a horrible mess. Saw her running through\\nthe landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging\\nbetween the trees. Crying something dreadful,” he\\nsaid happily. “Poor thing,” he added unconvincingly.\\n“Did she say who did it?” said Dumbledore quietly.\\n“Oh yes, Professorhead,” said Peeves, with the air of\\none cradling a large bombshell in his arms. “He got\\nvery angry when she wouldn’t let him in, you see.”\\nPeeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from\\n \\nbetween his own legs. “Nasty temper he’s got, that\\nSirius Black.”\\n \\n9\\nGRIM DEFEAT\\nProfessor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to\\nthe Great Hall, where they were joined ten minutes\\nlater by the students from Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\\nSlytherin, who all looked extremely confused.\\n“The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough\\nsearch of the castle,” Professor Dumbledore told them\\nas Professors McGonagall and Flitwick closed all\\ndoors into the hall. “I’m afraid that, for your own\\nsafety, you will have to spend the night here. I want\\nthe prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the\\nhall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in\\ncharge. Any disturbance should be reported to me\\nimmediately,” he added to Percy, who was looking\\nimmensely proud and important. “Send word with one\\nof the ghosts.”\\nProfessor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall,\\nand said, “Oh, yes, you’ll be needing ...”\\nOne casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew\\nto the edges of the hall and stood themselves against\\n \\nthe walls; another wave, and the floor was covered\\nwith hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.\\n“Sleep well,” said Professor Dumbledore, closing the\\ndoor behind him.\\nThe hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the\\nGryffindors were telling the rest of the school what\\nhad just happened.\\n“Everyone into their sleeping bags!” shouted Percy.\\n“Come on, now, no more talking! Lights out in ten\\nminutes!”\\n“C’mon,” Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized\\nthree sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner.\\n“Do you think Black’s still in the castle?” Hermione\\nwhispered anxiously.\\n“Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,” said Ron.\\n“It’s very lucky he picked tonight, you know,” said\\nHermione as they climbed fully dressed into their\\nsleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows\\nto talk. “The one night we weren’t in the tower. ...”\\n“I reckon he’s lost track of time, being on the run,”\\nsaid Ron. “Didn’t realize it was Halloween. Otherwise\\nhe’d have come bursting in here.”\\nHermione shuddered.\\nAll around them, people were asking one another the\\nsame question: “How did he get in?”\\n“Maybe he knows how to Apparate,” said a Ravenclaw\\na few feet away. “Just appear out of thin air, you\\nknow.”\\n \\n“Disguised himself, probably,” said a Hufflepuff fifth\\nyear.\\n“He could’ve flown in,” suggested Dean Thomas.\\n“Honestly, am I the only person who’s ever bothered\\nto read Hogwarts, A History?” said Hermione crossly\\nto Harry and Ron.\\n“Probably,” said Ron. “Why?”\\n“Because the castle’s protected by more than walls,\\nyou know,” said Hermione. “There are all sorts of\\nenchantments on it, to stop people entering by\\nstealth. You can’t just Apparate in here. And I’d like\\nto see the disguise that could fool those dementors.\\nThey’re guarding every single entrance to the\\ngrounds. They’d have seen him fly in too. And Filch\\nknows all the secret passages, they’ll have them\\ncovered. ...”\\n“The lights are going out now!” Percy shouted. “I want\\neveryone in their sleeping bags and no more talking!”\\nThe candles all went out at once. The only light now\\ncame from the silvery ghosts, who were drifting about\\ntalking seriously to the prefects, and the enchanted\\nceiling, which, like the sky outside, was scattered\\nwith stars. What with that, and the whispering that\\nstill filled the hall, Harry felt as though he were\\nsleeping outdoors in a light wind.\\nOnce every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall\\nto check that everything was quiet. Around three in\\nthe morning, when many students had finally fallen\\nasleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched\\nhim looking around for Percy, who had been prowling\\nbetween the sleeping bags, telling people off for\\ntalking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry,\\n \\nRon, and Hermione, who quickly pretended to be\\nasleep as Dumbledore’s footsteps drew nearer.\\n“Any sign of him, Professor?” asked Percy in a\\nwhisper.\\n“No. All well here?”\\n“Everything under control, sir.”\\n“Good. There’s no point moving them all now. I’ve\\nfound a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor\\nportrait hole. You’ll be able to move them back in\\ntomorrow.”\\n“And the Fat Lady, sir?”\\n“Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor.\\nApparently she refused to let Black in without the\\npassword, so he attacked. She’s still very distressed,\\nbut once she’s calmed down, I’ll have Mr. Filch\\nrestore her.”\\nHarry heard the door of the hall creak open again,\\nand more footsteps.\\n“Headmaster?” It was Snape. Harry kept quite still,\\nlistening hard. “The whole of the third floor has been\\nsearched. He’s not there. And Filch has done the\\ndungeons; nothing there either.”\\n“What about the Astronomy tower? Professor\\nTrelawney’s room? The Owlery?”\\n“All searched ...”\\n“Very well, Severus. I didn’t really expect Black to\\nlinger.”\\n \\n“Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?”\\nasked Snape.\\nHarry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free\\nhis other ear.\\n“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the\\nnext.”\\nHarry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to\\nwhere they stood; Dumbledore ’s back was to him, but\\nhe could see Percy’s face, rapt with attention, and\\nSnape ’s profile, which looked angry.\\n“You remember the conversation we had,\\nHeadmaster, just before — ah — the start of term?”\\nsaid Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as\\nthough trying to block Percy out of the conversation.\\n“I do, Severus,” said Dumbledore, and there was\\nsomething like warning in his voice.\\n“It seems — almost impossible — that Black could\\nhave entered the school without inside help. I did\\nexpress my concerns when you appointed — ”\\n“I do not believe a single person inside this castle\\nwould have helped Black enter it,” said Dumbledore,\\nand his tone made it so clear that the subject was\\nclosed that Snape didn’t reply. “I must go down to the\\ndementors,” said Dumbledore. “I said I would inform\\nthem when our search was complete.”\\n“Didn’t they want to help, sir?” said Percy.\\n“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore coldly. “But I’m afraid no\\ndementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I\\nam headmaster.”\\n \\nPercy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the\\nhall, walking quickly and quietly. Snape stood for a\\nmoment, watching the headmaster with an expression\\nof deep resentment on his face; then he too left.\\nHarry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of\\nthem had their eyes open too, reflecting the starry\\nceiling.\\n“What was all that about?” Ron mouthed.\\nThe school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the\\nnext few days. The theories about how he had entered\\nthe castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott,\\nfrom Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology\\nclass telling anyone who’d listen that Black could\\nturn into a flowering shrub.\\nThe Fat Lady’s ripped canvas had been taken off the\\nwall and replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan\\nand his fat gray pony. Nobody was very happy about\\nthis. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging\\npeople to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously\\ncomplicated passwords, which he changed at least\\ntwice a day.\\n“He’s a complete lunatic,” said Seamus Finnigan\\nangrily to Percy. “Can’t we get anyone else?”\\n“None of the other pictures wanted the job,” said\\nPercy. “Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady.\\nSir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to\\nvolunteer.”\\nSir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry’s\\nworries. He was now being closely watched. Teachers\\nfound excuses to walk along corridors with him, and\\nPercy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his\\nmother’s orders) was tailing him everywhere like an\\n \\nextremely pompous guard dog. To cap it all, Professor\\nMcGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with\\nsuch a somber expression on her face Harry thought\\nsomeone must have died.\\n“There’s no point hiding it from you any longer,\\nPotter,” she said in a very serious voice. “I know this\\nwill come as a shock to you, but Sirius Black — ”\\n“I know he’s after me,” said Harry wearily. “I heard\\nRon’s dad telling his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the\\nMinistry of Magic.”\\nProfessor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She\\nstared at Harry for a moment or two, then said, “I see!\\nWell, in that case, Potter, you’ll understand why I\\ndon’t think it’s a good idea for you to be practicing\\nQuidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only\\nyour team members, it’s very exposed, Potter — ”\\n“We’ve got our first match on Saturday!” said Harry,\\noutraged. “I’ve got to train, Professor!”\\nProfessor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry\\nknew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor\\nteam’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d\\nsuggested him as Seeker in the first place. He waited,\\nholding his breath.\\n“Hmm ...” Professor McGonagall stood up and stared\\nout of the window at the Quidditch field, just visible\\nthrough the rain. “Well ... goodness knows, I’d like to\\nsee us win the Cup at last ... but all the same, Potter\\n... I’d be happier if a teacher were present. I’ll ask\\nMadam Hooch to oversee your training sessions.”\\nThe weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch\\nmatch drew nearer. Undaunted, the Gryffindor team\\nwas training harder than ever under the eye of\\n \\nMadam Hooch. Then, at their final training session\\nbefore Saturday’s match, Oliver Wood gave his team\\nsome unwelcome news.\\n“We’re not playing Slytherin!” he told them, looking\\nvery angry. “Flint’s just been to see me. We’re playing\\nHufflepuff instead.”\\n“Why?” chorused the rest of the team.\\n“Flint’s excuse is that their Seeker’s arm’s still\\ninjured,” said Wood, grinding his teeth furiously. “But\\nit’s obvious why they’re doing it. Don’t want to play in\\nthis weather. Think it’ll damage their chances. ...”\\nThere had been strong winds and heavy rain all day,\\nand as Wood spoke, they heard a distant rumble of\\nthunder.\\n“There’s nothing wrong with Malfoy’s arm!” said Harry\\nfuriously. “He’s faking it!”\\n“I know that, but we can’t prove it,” said Wood\\nbitterly. “And we’ve been practicing all those moves\\nassuming we’re playing Slytherin, and instead it’s\\nHufflepuff, and their style’s quite different. They’ve got\\na new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory — ”\\nAngelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.\\n“What?” said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted\\nbehavior.\\n“He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he?” said\\nAngelina.\\n“Strong and silent,” said Katie, and they started to\\ngiggle again.\\n \\n“He’s only silent because he’s too thick to string two\\nwords together,” said Fred impatiently. “I don’t know\\nwhy you’re worried, Oliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover.\\nLast time we played them, Harry caught the Snitch in\\nabout five minutes, remember?”\\n“We were playing in completely different conditions!”\\nWood shouted, his eyes bulging slightly. “Diggory’s\\nput a very strong side together! He’s an excellent\\nSeeker! I was afraid you’d take it like this! We mustn’t\\nrelax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to\\nwrong-foot us! We must win!”\\n“Oliver, calm down!” said Fred, looking slightly\\nalarmed. “We’re taking Hufflepuff very seriously.\\nSeriously.”\\nThe day before the match, the winds reached howling\\npoint and the rain fell harder than ever. It was so\\ndark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra\\ntorches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team was\\nlooking very smug indeed, and none more so than\\nMalfoy.\\n“Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!” he sighed\\nas the gale outside pounded the windows.\\nHarry had no room in his head to worry about\\nanything except the match tomorrow. Oliver Wood\\nkept hurrying up to him between classes and giving\\nhim tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked\\nfor so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten\\nminutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and\\nset off at a run with Wood shouting after him,\\n“Diggory’s got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might\\nwant to try looping him — ”\\n \\nHarry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against\\nthe Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and\\ndashed inside.\\n“Sorry I’m late, Professor Lupin, I — ”\\nBut it wasn’t Professor Lupin who looked up at him\\nfrom the teacher’s desk; it was Snape.\\n“This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think\\nwe’ll make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down.”\\nBut Harry didn’t move.\\n“Where’s Professor Lupin?” he said.\\n“He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,” said\\nSnape with a twisted smile. “I believe I told you to sit\\ndown?”\\nBut Harry stayed where he was.\\n“What’s wrong with him?”\\nSnape ’s black eyes glittered.\\n“Nothing life-threatening,” he said, looking as though\\nhe wished it were. “Five more points from Gryffindor,\\nand if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be\\nfifty.”\\nHarry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape\\nlooked around at the class.\\n“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor\\nLupin has not left any record of the topics you have\\ncovered so far — ”\\n \\n“Please, sir, we’ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas,\\nand grindylows,” said Hermione quickly, “and we’re\\njust about to start — ”\\n“Be quiet,” said Snape coldly. “I did not ask for\\ninformation. I was merely commenting on Professor\\nLupin’s lack of organization.”\\n“He’s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher\\nwe’ve ever had,” said Dean Thomas boldly, and there\\nwas a murmur of agreement from the rest of the\\nclass. Snape looked more menacing than ever.\\n“You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing\\nyou — I would expect first years to be able to deal\\nwith Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall\\ndiscuss — ”\\nHarry watched him flick through the textbook, to the\\nvery back chapter, which he must know they hadn’t\\ncovered.\\n“ — werewolves,” said Snape.\\n“But, sir,” said Hermione, seemingly unable to\\nrestrain herself, “we’re not supposed to do werewolves\\nyet, we’re due to start hinkypunks — ”\\n“Miss Granger,” said Snape in a voice of deadly calm,\\n“I was under the impression that I am teaching this\\nlesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to\\npage 394.” He glanced around again. “All of you!\\nNow\\\\”\\nWith many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen\\nmuttering, the class opened their books.\\n“Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between\\nthe werewolf and the true wolf?” said Snape.\\n \\nEveryone sat in motionless silence; everyone except\\nHermione, whose hand, as it so often did, had shot\\nstraight into the air.\\n“Anyone?” Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted\\nsmile was back. “Are you telling me that Professor\\nLupin hasn’t even taught you the basic distinction\\nbetween — ”\\n“We told you,” said Parvati suddenly, “we haven’t got\\nas far as werewolves yet, we’re still on — ”\\n“Silencel” snarled Snape. “Well, well, well, I never\\nthought I’d meet a third -year class who wouldn’t even\\nrecognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make\\na point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very\\nbehind you all are. ...”\\n“Please, sir,” said Hermione, whose hand was still in\\nthe air, “the werewolf differs from the true wolf in\\nseveral small ways. The snout of the werewolf — ”\\n“That is the second time you have spoken out of turn,\\nMiss Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five more points\\nfrom Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.”\\nHermione went very red, put down her hand, and\\nstared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a\\nmark of how much the class loathed Snape that they\\nwere all glaring at him, because every one of them\\nhad called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and\\nRon, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least\\ntwice a week, said loudly, “You asked us a question\\nand she knows the answer! Why ask if you don’t want\\nto be told?”\\nThe class knew instantly he’d gone too far. Snape\\nadvanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its\\nbreath.\\n \\n“Detention, Weasley,” Snape said silkily, his face very\\nclose to Ron’s. “And if I ever hear you criticize the way\\nI teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.”\\nNo one made a sound throughout the rest of the\\nlesson. They sat and made notes on werewolves from\\nthe textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the\\nrows of desks, examining the work they had been\\ndoing with Professor Lupin.\\n“Very poorly explained . . . That is incorrect, the kappa\\nis more commonly found in Mongolia. . . . Professor\\nLupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn’t have given\\nit three. ...”\\nWhen the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.\\n“You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me,\\non the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want\\ntwo rolls of parchment on the subject, and I want\\nthem by Monday morning. It is time somebody took\\nthis class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to\\narrange your detention.”\\nHarry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the\\nclass, who waited until they were well out of earshot,\\nthen burst into a furious tirade about Snape.\\n“Snape ’s never been like this with any of our other\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did\\nwant the job,” Harry said to Hermione. “Why’s he got\\nit in for Lupin? D’you think this is all because of the\\nboggart?”\\n“I don’t know,” said Hermione pensively. “But I really\\nhope Professor Lupin gets better soon. ...”\\nRon caught up with them five minutes later, in a\\ntowering rage.\\n \\n“D’you know what that — ” (he called Snape\\nsomething that made Hermione say “Ron\\\\”) “ — is\\nmaking me do? I’ve got to scrub out the bedpans in\\nthe hospital wing. Without magid” He was breathing\\ndeeply, his fists clenched. “Why couldn’t Black have\\nhidden in Snape’s office, eh? He could have finished\\nhim off for us!”\\nHarry woke extremely early the next morning; so early\\nthat it was still dark. For a moment he thought the\\nroaring of the wind had woken him. Then he felt a\\ncold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt\\nupright — Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating\\nnext to him, blowing hard in his ear.\\n“What did you do that for?” said Harry furiously.\\nPeeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed\\nbackward out of the room, cackling.\\nHarry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It\\nwas half past four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and\\ntried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now\\nthat he was awake, to ignore the sounds of the\\nthunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind\\nagainst the castle walls, and the distant creaking of\\nthe trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he\\nwould be out on the Quidditch field, battling through\\nthat gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more\\nsleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two\\nThousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory.\\nAs Harry opened the door, something brushed against\\nhis leg. He bent down just in time to grab\\nCrookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag\\nhim outside.\\n“You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,” Harry\\ntold Crookshanks suspiciously. “There are plenty of\\n \\nmice around this place — go and chase them. Go on,”\\nhe added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral\\nstaircase with his foot. “Leave Scabbers alone.”\\nThe noise of the storm was even louder in the\\ncommon room. Harry knew better than to think the\\nmatch would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren’t\\ncalled off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless,\\nhe was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had\\npointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor;\\nDiggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry.\\nSeekers were usually light and speedy, but Diggory’s\\nweight would be an advantage in this weather\\nbecause he was less likely to be blown off course.\\nHarry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of\\nthe fire, getting up every now and then to stop\\nCrookshanks from sneaking up the boys’ staircase\\nagain. At long last Harry thought it must be time for\\nbreakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole\\nalone.\\n“Stand and fight, you mangy cur!” yelled Sir Cadogan.\\n“Oh, shut up,” Harry yawned.\\nHe revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by\\nthe time he’d started on toast, the rest of the team\\nhad turned up.\\n“It’s going to be a tough one,” said Wood, who wasn’t\\neating anything.\\n“Stop worrying, Oliver,” said Alicia soothingly, “we\\ndon’t mind a bit of rain.”\\nBut it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such\\nwas the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school\\nturned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran\\n \\ndown the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads\\nbowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being\\nwhipped out of their hands as they went. Just before\\nhe entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy,\\nCrabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from\\nunder an enormous umbrella on their way to the\\nstadium.\\nThe team changed into their scarlet robes and waited\\nfor Wood’s usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn’t\\ncome. He tried to speak several times, made an odd\\ngulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and\\nbeckoned them to follow him.\\nThe wind was so strong that they staggered sideways\\nas they walked out onto the field. If the crowd was\\ncheering, they couldn’t hear it over the fresh rolls of\\nthunder. Rain was splattering over Harry’s glasses.\\nHow on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?\\nThe Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite\\nside of the field, wearing canary -yellow robes. The\\nCaptains walked up to each other and shook hands;\\nDiggory smiled at Wood but Wood now looked as\\nthough he had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw\\nMadam Hooch’s mouth form the words, “Mount your\\nbrooms.” He pulled his right foot out of the mud with\\na squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two\\nThousand. Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips\\nand gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant —\\nthey were off.\\nHarry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly\\nwith the wind. He held it as steady as he could and\\nturned, squinting into the rain.\\nWithin five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and\\nfrozen, hardly able to see his teammates, let alone the\\ntiny Snitch. He flew backward and forward across the\\n \\nfield past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no idea\\nof what was happening in the rest of the game. He\\ncouldn’t hear the commentary over the wind. The\\ncrowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and\\nbattered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to\\nbeing unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so\\nclouded by the rain on his glasses he hadn’t seen\\nthem coming.\\nHe lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder\\nto hold his broom straight. The sky was getting\\ndarker, as though night had decided to come early.\\nTwice Harry nearly hit another player, without\\nknowing whether it was a teammate or opponent;\\neveryone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, he\\ncould hardly tell them apart. ...\\nWith the first flash of lightning came the sound of\\nMadam Hooch’s whistle; Harry could just see the\\noutline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him\\nto the ground. The whole team splashed down into\\nthe mud.\\n“I called for time-out!” Wood roared at his team.\\n“Come on, under here — ”\\nThey huddled at the edge of the field under a large\\numbrella; Harry took off his glasses and wiped them\\nhurriedly on his robes.\\n“What’s the score?”\\n“We’re fifty points up,” said Wood, “but unless we get\\nthe Snitch soon, we’ll be playing into the night.”\\n“I’ve got no chance with these on,” Harry said\\nexasperatedly, waving his glasses.\\n \\nAt that very moment, Hermione appeared at his\\nshoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head\\nand was, inexplicably, beaming.\\n“I’ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!”\\nHe handed them to her, and as the team watched in\\namazement, Hermione tapped them with her wand\\nand said, “Imperviusl”\\n“There!” she said, handing them back to Harry.\\n“They’ll repel water!”\\nWood looked as though he could have kissed her.\\n“Brilliant!” he called hoarsely after her as she\\ndisappeared into the crowd. “Okay, team, let’s go for\\nit!”\\nHermione ’s spell had done the trick. Harry was still\\nnumb with cold, still wetter than he’d ever been in his\\nlife, but he could see. Full of fresh determination, he\\nurged his broom through the turbulent air, staring in\\nevery direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger,\\nducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the\\nopposite direction. ...\\nThere was another clap of thunder, followed\\nimmediately by forked lightning. This was getting\\nmore and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the\\nSnitch quickly —\\nHe turned, intending to head back toward the middle\\nof the field, but at that moment, another flash of\\nlightning illuminated the stands, and Harry saw\\nsomething that distracted him completely — the\\nsilhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly\\nimprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost,\\nempty row of seats.\\n \\nHarry’s numb hands slipped on the broom handle\\nand his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking his\\nsodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back into\\nthe stands. The dog had vanished.\\n“Harry!” came Wood’s anguished yell from the\\nGryffindor goal posts. “Harry, behind you!”\\nHarry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was\\npelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was\\nshimmering in the rain-filled air between them —\\nWith a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the\\nbroom-handle and zoomed toward the Snitch.\\n“Come on!” he growled at his Nimbus as the rain\\nwhipped his face. “Fasteri”\\nBut something odd was happening. An eerie silence\\nwas falling across the stadium. The wind, though as\\nstrong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It was as\\nthough someone had turned off the sound, as though\\nHarry had gone suddenly deaf — what was going on?\\nAnd then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over\\nhim, inside him, just as he became aware of\\nsomething moving on the field below. . . .\\nBefore he’d had time to think, Harry had taken his\\neyes off the Snitch and looked down.\\nAt least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces\\npointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It\\nwas as though freezing water were rising in his chest,\\ncutting at his insides. And then he heard it again. ...\\nSomeone was screaming, screaming inside his head\\n... a woman . . .\\n“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry\\\\”\\n \\n“ Stand aside, you silly girl ... stand aside, now. ...”\\n“ Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead — ”\\nNumbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry’s\\nbrain. . . . What was he doing? Why was he flying? He\\nneeded to help her. ... She was going to die. ... She\\nwas going to be murdered. ...\\nHe was falling, falling through the icy mist.\\n“Not Harry\\\\ Please ... have mercy ... have mercy. ...”\\nA shrill voice was laughing, the woman was\\nscreaming, and Harry knew no more.\\n“Lucky the ground was so soft.”\\n“I thought he was dead for sure.”\\n“But he didn’t even break his glasses.”\\nHarry could hear the voices whispering, but they\\nmade no sense whatsoever. He didn’t have a clue\\nwhere he was, or how he’d got there, or what he’d\\nbeen doing before he got there. All he knew was that\\nevery inch of him was aching as though it had been\\nbeaten.\\n“That was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”\\nScariest . . . the scariest thing . . . hooded black figures\\n... cold ... screaming ...\\nHarry’s eyes snapped open. He was lying in the\\nhospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team,\\nspattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered\\naround his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there,\\n \\nlooking as though they’d just climbed out of a\\nswimming pool.\\n“Harry!” said Fred, who looked extremely white\\nunderneath the mud. “How’re you feeling?”\\nIt was as though Harry’s memory was on fast forward.\\nThe lightning — the Grim — the Snitch — and the\\ndementors ...\\n“What happened?” he said, sitting up so suddenly\\nthey all gasped.\\n“You fell off,” said Fred. “Must’ve been — what — fifty\\nfeet?”\\n“We thought you’d died,” said Alicia, who was\\nshaking.\\nHermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were\\nextremely bloodshot.\\n“But the match,” said Harry. “What happened? Are we\\ndoing a replay?”\\nNo one said anything. The horrible truth sank into\\nHarry like a stone.\\n“We didn’t — lose?”\\n“Diggory got the Snitch,” said George. “Just after you\\nfell. He didn’t realize what had happened. When he\\nlooked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to\\ncall it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and\\nsquare ... even Wood admits it.”\\n“Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he\\nwasn’t there.\\n \\n“Still in the showers,” said Fred. “We think he’s trying\\nto drown himself.”\\nHarry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping\\nhis hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it\\nroughly.\\n“C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch\\nbefore.”\\n“There had to be one time you didn’t get it,” said\\nGeorge.\\n“It’s not over yet,” said Fred. “We lost by a hundred\\npoints, right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and\\nwe beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin ...”\\n“Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred\\npoints,” said George.\\n“But if they beat Ravenclaw ...”\\n“No way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses\\nagainst Hufflepuff ...”\\n“It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred\\neither way — ”\\nHarry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost ...\\nfor the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.\\nAfter ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to\\ntell the team to leave him in peace.\\n“Well come and see you later,” Fred told him. “Don’t\\nbeat yourself up, Harry, you’re still the best Seeker\\nwe’ve ever had.”\\n \\nThe team trooped out, trailing mud behind them.\\nMadam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking\\ndisapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to\\nHarry’s bed.\\n“Dumbledore was really angry,” Hermione said in a\\nquaking voice. “I’ve never seen him like that before.\\nHe ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wand, and\\nyou sort of slowed down before you hit the ground.\\nThen he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot\\nsilver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away.\\n... He was furious they’d come onto the grounds. We\\nheard him — ”\\n“Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,” said Ron.\\n“And walked up to school with you floating on it.\\nEveryone thought you were ...”\\nHis voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was\\nthinking about what the dementors had done to him\\n... about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw\\nRon and Hermione looking at him so anxiously that\\nhe quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to\\nsay.\\n“Did someone get my Nimbus?”\\nRon and Hermione looked quickly at each other.\\n“Er — ”\\n“What?” said Harry, looking from one to the other.\\n“Well ... when you fell off, it got blown away,” said\\nHermione hesitantly.\\n“And?”\\n \\n“And it hit — it hit — oh, Harry — it hit the\\nWhomping Willow.”\\nHarry’s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a\\nvery violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the\\ngrounds.\\n“And?” he said, dreading the answer.\\n“Well, you know the Whomping Willow,” said Ron. “It\\n— it doesn’t like being hit.”\\n“Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you\\ncame around,” said Hermione in a very small voice.\\nSlowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned\\nit upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered\\nwood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of\\nHarry’s faithful, finally beaten broomstick.\\n \\n10\\nTHE MARAUDER’S MAP\\nMadam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the\\nhospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He didn’t\\nargue or complain, but he wouldn’t let her throw\\naway the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two\\nThousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that\\nthe Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn’t\\nhelp it; he felt as though he’d lost one of his best\\nfriends.\\nHe had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him\\nup. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that\\nlooked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley,\\nblushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she\\nhad made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry\\nkept it shut under his bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor\\nteam visited again on Sunday morning, this time\\naccompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow,\\ndead sort of voice) that he didn’t blame him in the\\nslightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry’s bedside only\\nat night. But nothing anyone said or did could make\\nHarry feel any better, because they knew only half of\\nwhat was troubling him.\\n \\nHe hadn’t told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron\\nand Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic\\nand Hermione would scoff. The fact remained,\\nhowever, that it had now appeared twice, and both\\nappearances had been followed by near-fatal\\naccidents; the first time, he had nearly been run over\\nby the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from\\nhis broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him\\nuntil he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest\\nof his life looking over his shoulder for the beast?\\nAnd then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick\\nand humiliated every time he thought of them.\\nEveryone said the dementors were horrible, but no\\none else collapsed every time they went near one. No\\none else heard echoes in their head of their dying\\nparents.\\nBecause Harry knew who that screaming voice\\nbelonged to now. He had heard her words, heard\\nthem over and over again during the night hours in\\nthe hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the\\nstrips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the\\ndementors approached him, he heard the last\\nmoments of his mother’s life, her attempts to protect\\nhim, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort’s\\nlaughter before he murdered her. . . . Harry dozed\\nfitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted\\nhands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell\\nagain on his mother’s voice.\\nIt was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the\\nmain school on Monday, where he was forced to think\\nabout other things, even if he had to endure Draco\\nMalfoy’s taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself\\nwith glee at Gryffindor’s defeat. He had finally taken\\noff his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of\\nboth arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry\\nfalling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their next\\n \\nPotions class doing dementor imitations across the\\ndungeon; Ron finally cracked and flung a large,\\nslippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in\\nthe face and caused Snape to take fifty points from\\nGryffindor.\\n“If Snape’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts\\nagain, I’m skiving off,” said Ron as they headed\\ntoward Lupin’s classroom after lunch. “Check who’s\\nin there, Hermione.”\\nHermione peered around the classroom door.\\n“It’s okay!”\\nProfessor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked\\nas though he had been ill. His old robes were hanging\\nmore loosely on him and there were dark shadows\\nbeneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class\\nas they took their seats, and they burst at once into\\nan explosion of complaints about Snape’s behavior\\nwhile Lupin had been ill.\\n“It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give\\nus homework?”\\n“We don’t know anything about werewolves — ”\\n“ — two rolls of parchment!”\\n“Did you tell Professor Snape we haven’t covered them\\nyet?” Lupin asked, frowning slightly.\\nThe babble broke out again.\\n“Yes, but he said we were really behind — ”\\n“ — he wouldn’t listen — ”\\n \\n“ — two rolls of parchmenti”\\nProfessor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on\\nevery face.\\n“Don’t worry. I’ll speak to Professor Snape. You don’t\\nhave to do the essay.”\\n“Oh no,” said Hermione, looking very disappointed.\\n“I’ve already finished it!”\\nThey had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin\\nhad brought along a glass box containing a\\nhinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as\\nthough he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail\\nand harmless-looking.\\n“Lures travelers into bogs,” said Professor Lupin as\\nthey took notes. “You notice the lantern dangling from\\nhis hand? Hops ahead — people follow the light —\\nthen — ’ ”\\nThe hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise\\nagainst the glass.\\nWhen the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things\\nand headed for the door, Harry among them, but —\\n“Wait a moment, Harry,” Lupin called. “I’d like a\\nword.”\\nHarry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin\\ncovering the hinkypunk’s box with a cloth.\\n“I heard about the match,” said Lupin, turning back\\nto his desk and starting to pile books into his\\nbriefcase, “and I’m sorry about your broomstick. Is\\nthere any chance of fixing it?”\\n \\n“No,” said Harry. “The tree smashed it to bits.”\\nLupin sighed.\\n“They planted the Whomping Willow the same year\\nthat I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a\\ngame, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In\\nthe end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an\\neye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No\\nbroomstick would have a chance.\\n“Did you hear about the dementors too?” said Harry\\nwith difficulty.\\nLupin looked at him quickly.\\n“Yes, I did. I don’t think any of us have seen Professor\\nDumbledore that angry. They have been growing\\nrestless for some time ... furious at his refusal to let\\nthem inside the grounds. ... I suppose they were the\\nreason you fell?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question\\nhe had to ask burst from him before he could stop\\nhimself. “ Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I\\njust — ?”\\n“It has nothing to do with weakness,” said Professor\\nLupin sharply, as though he had read Harry’s mind.\\n“The dementors affect you worse than the others\\nbecause there are horrors in your past that the others\\ndon’t have.”\\nA ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom,\\nilluminating Lupin’s gray hairs and the lines on his\\nyoung face.\\n“Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk\\nthis earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places,\\n \\nthey glory in decay and despair, they drain peace,\\nhope, and happiness out of the air around them.\\nEven Muggles feel their presence, though they can’t\\nsee them. Get too near a dementor and every good\\nfeeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of\\nyou. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long\\nenough to reduce you to something like itself . . . soul-\\nless and evil. You’ll be left with nothing but the worst\\nexperiences of your life. And the worst that happened\\nto you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their\\nbroom. You have nothing to feel ashamed of.”\\n“When they get near me — ” Harry stared at Lupin’s\\ndesk, his throat tight. “I can hear Voldemort\\nmurdering my mum.”\\nLupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though\\nto grip Harry’s shoulder, but thought better of it.\\nThere was a moment’s silence, then —\\n“Why did they have to come to the match?” said Harry\\nbitterly.\\n“They’re getting hungry,” said Lupin coolly, shutting\\nhis briefcase with a snap. “Dumbledore won’t let them\\ninto the school, so their supply of human prey has\\ndried up. ... I don’t think they could resist the large\\ncrowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement\\n. . . emotions running high ... it was their idea of a\\nfeast.”\\n“Azkaban must be terrible,” Harry muttered. Lupin\\nnodded grimly.\\n“The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea,\\nbut they don’t need walls and water to keep the\\nprisoners in, not when they’re all trapped inside their\\nown heads, incapable of a single cheerful thought.\\nMost of them go mad within weeks.”\\n \\n“But Sirius Black escaped from them,” Harry said\\nslowly. “He got away. ...”\\nLupin’s briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to\\nstoop quickly to catch it.\\n“Yes,” he said, straightening up, “Black must have\\nfound a way to fight them. I wouldn’t have believed it\\npossible. ... Dementors are supposed to drain a\\nwizard of his powers if he is left with them too long.\\n“You made that dementor on the train back off,” said\\nHarry suddenly.\\n“There are — certain defenses one can use,” said\\nLupin. “But there was only one dementor on the train.\\nThe more there are, the more difficult it becomes to\\nresist.”\\n“What defenses?” said Harry at once. “Can you teach\\nme?”\\n“I don’t pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors,\\nHarry ... quite the contrary. ...”\\n“But if the dementors come to another Quidditch\\nmatch, I need to be able to fight them — ”\\nLupin looked into Harry’s determined face, hesitated,\\nthen said, “Well ... all right. I’ll try and help. But it’ll\\nhave to wait until next term, I’m afraid. I have a lot to\\ndo before the holidays. I chose a very inconvenient\\ntime to fall ill.”\\nWhat with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from\\nLupin, the thought that he might never have to hear\\nhis mother’s death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw\\nflattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the\\n \\nend of November, Harry’s mood took a definite\\nupturn. Gryffindor were not out of the running after\\nall, although they could not afford to lose another\\nmatch. Wood became repossessed of his manic\\nenergy, and worked his team as hard as ever in the\\nchilly haze of rain that persisted into December.\\nHarry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds.\\nDumbledore’s anger seemed to be keeping them at\\ntheir stations at the entrances.\\nTwo weeks before the end of the term, the sky\\nlightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and\\nthe muddy grounds were revealed one morning\\ncovered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was\\na buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the\\nCharms teacher, had already decorated his classroom\\nwith shimmering lights that turned out to be real,\\nfluttering fairies. The students were all happily\\ndiscussing their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and\\nHermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and\\nthough Ron said it was because he couldn’t stand two\\nweeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed\\nto use the library, Harry wasn’t fooled; they were\\ndoing it to keep him company, and he was very\\ngrateful.\\nTo everyone’s delight except Harry’s, there was to be\\nanother Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of\\nthe term.\\n“We can do all our Christmas shopping there!” said\\nHermione. “Mum and Dad would really love those\\nToothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!”\\nResigned to the fact that he would be the only third\\nyear staying behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of\\nWhich Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend\\nthe day reading up on the different makes. He had\\nbeen riding one of the school brooms at team\\n \\npractice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very\\nslow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of\\nhis own.\\nOn the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip,\\nHarry bid good-bye to Ron and Hermione, who were\\nwrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the\\nmarble staircase alone, and headed back toward\\nGryffindor Tower. Snow had started to fall outside the\\nwindows, and the castle was very still and quiet.\\n“Psst — Harry!”\\nHe turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to\\nsee Fred and George peering out at him from behind a\\nstatue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch.\\n“What are you doing?” said Harry curiously. “How\\ncome you’re not going to Hogsmeade?”\\n“We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before\\nwe go,” said Fred, with a mysterious wink. “Come in\\nhere. ...”\\nHe nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of\\nthe one-eyed statue. Harry followed Fred and George\\ninside. George closed the door quietly and then\\nturned, beaming, to look at Harry.\\n“Early Christmas present for you, Harry,” he said.\\nFred pulled something from inside his cloak with a\\nflourish and laid it on one of the desks. It was a large,\\nsquare, very worn piece of parchment with nothing\\nwritten on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and\\nGeorge’s jokes, stared at it.\\n“What’s that supposed to be?”\\n \\n“This, Harry, is the secret of our success,” said\\nGeorge, patting the parchment fondly.\\n“It’s a wrench, giving it to you,” said Fred, “but we\\ndecided last night, your need’s greater than ours.”\\n“Anyway, we know it by heart,” said George. “We\\nbequeath it to you. We don’t really need it anymore.”\\n“And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?”\\nsaid Harry.\\n“A bit of old parchment!” said Fred, closing his eyes\\nwith a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended\\nhim. “Explain, George.”\\n“Well ... when we were in our first year, Harry —\\nyoung, carefree, and innocent — ”\\nHarry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George\\nhad ever been innocent.\\n“ — well, more innocent than we are now — we got\\ninto a spot of bother with Filch.”\\n“We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset\\nhim for some reason — ”\\n“So he hauled us off to his office and started\\nthreatening us with the usual — ”\\n“ — detention — ”\\n“ — disembowelment — ”\\n“ — and we couldn’t help noticing a drawer in one of\\nhis filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly\\nDangerous.”\\n \\n“Don’t tell me — ” said Harry, starting to grin.\\n“Well, what would you’ve done?” said Fred. “George\\ncaused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I\\nwhipped the drawer open, and grabbed — this.”\\n“It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know,” said George.\\n“We don’t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it.\\nHe probably suspected what it was, though, or he\\nwouldn’t have confiscated it.”\\n“And you know how to work it?”\\n“Oh yes,” said Fred, smirking. “This little beauty’s\\ntaught us more than all the teachers in this school.”\\n“You’re winding me up,” said Harry, looking at the\\nragged old bit of parchment.\\n“Oh, are we?” said George.\\nHe took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly,\\nand said, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”\\nAnd at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a\\nspider’s web from the point that George’s wand had\\ntouched. They joined each other, they crisscrossed,\\nthey fanned into every corner of the parchment; then\\nwords began to blossom across the top, great, curly\\ngreen words, that proclaimed:\\nMessrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs\\nPurveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers\\nare proud to present\\nTHE MARAUDER’S MAP\\n \\nIt was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts\\ncastle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing\\nwere the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled\\nwith a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry\\nbent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner\\nshowed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his\\nstudy; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling\\nthe second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was\\ncurrently bouncing around the trophy room. And as\\nHarry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar\\ncorridors, he noticed something else.\\nThis map showed a set of passages he had never\\nentered. And many of them seemed to lead —\\n“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of\\nthem with his finger. “There are seven in all. Now,\\nFilch knows about these four” — he pointed them out\\n— “but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know\\nabout these. Don’t bother with the one behind the\\nmirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last\\nwinter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And\\nwe don’t reckon anyone’s ever used this one, because\\nthe Whomping Willow’s planted right over the\\nentrance. But this one here, this one leads right into\\nthe cellar of Honeydukes. We’ve used it loads of times.\\nAnd as you might’ve noticed, the entrance is right\\noutside this room, through that one-eyed old crone’s\\nhump.”\\n“Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,” sighed\\nGeorge, patting the heading of the map. “We owe\\nthem so much.”\\n“Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new\\ngeneration of law-breakers,” said Fred solemnly.\\n“Right,” said George briskly. “Don’t forget to wipe it\\nafter you’ve used it — ”\\n \\n“ — or anyone can read it,” Fred said warningly.\\n“Just tap it again and say, ‘Mischief managed!’ And\\nit’ll go blank.”\\n“So, young Harry,” said Fred, in an uncanny\\nimpersonation of Percy, “mind you behave yourself.”\\n“See you in Honeydukes,” said George, winking.\\nThey left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of\\nway.\\nHarry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He\\nwatched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause\\nto sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn’t\\nknow ... he wouldn’t have to pass the dementors at\\nall. ...\\nBut even as he stood there, flooded with excitement,\\nsomething Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say\\ncame floating out of his memory.\\nNever trust anything that can think for itself, if you\\ncan’t see where it keeps its brain.\\nThis map was one of those dangerous magical objects\\nMr. Weasley had been warning against. ... Aids for\\nMagical Mischief-Makers . . . but then, Harry reasoned,\\nhe only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it\\nwasn’t as though he wanted to steal anything or\\nattack anyone ... and Fred and George had been\\nusing it for years without anything horrible\\nhappening. ...\\nHarry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with\\nhis finger.\\n \\nThen, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he\\nrolled up the map, stuffed it inside his robes, and\\nhurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a\\ncouple of inches. There was no one outside. Very\\ncarefully, he edged out of the room and behind the\\nstatue of the one-eyed witch.\\nWhat did he have to do? He pulled out the map again\\nand saw, to his astonishment, that a new ink figure\\nhad appeared upon it, labeled Harry Potter. This\\nfigure was standing exactly where the real Harry was\\nstanding, about halfway down the third-floor corridor.\\nHarry watched carefully. His little ink self appeared to\\nbe tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry\\nquickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue.\\nNothing happened. He looked back at the map. The\\ntiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure.\\nThe word inside said, “ Dissendium.”\\n“ Dissendiurrd” Harry whispered, tapping the stone\\nwitch again.\\nAt once, the statue’s hump opened wide enough to\\nadmit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up\\nand down the corridor, then tucked the map away\\nagain, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and\\npushed himself forward.\\nHe slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone\\nslide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up,\\nlooking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his\\nwand, muttered, “Lumos\\\\” and saw that he was in a\\nvery narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the\\nmap, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and\\nmuttered, “Mischief managed!” The map went blank\\nat once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his\\nrobes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and\\napprehensive, he set off.\\n \\nThe passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow\\nof a giant rabbit than anything else. Harry hurried\\nalong it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor,\\nholding his wand out in front of him.\\nIt took ages, but Harry had the thought of\\nHoneydukes to sustain him. After what felt like an\\nhour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped\\nup, his face hot, his feet very cold.\\nTen minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn\\nstone steps, which rose out of sight above him.\\nCareful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb.\\nA hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as\\nhe climbed, watching his feet. ... Then, without\\nwarning, his head hit something hard.\\nIt seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there,\\nmassaging the top of his head, listening. He couldn’t\\nhear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he pushed\\nthe trapdoor open and peered over the edge.\\nHe was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates\\nand boxes. Harry climbed out of the trapdoor and\\nreplaced it — it blended so perfectly with the dusty\\nfloor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry\\ncrept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led\\nupstairs. Now he could definitely hear voices, not to\\nmention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and\\nshutting of a door.\\nWondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a\\ndoor open much closer at hand; somebody was about\\nto come downstairs.\\n“And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they’ve\\nnearly cleaned us out — ” said a woman’s voice.\\n \\nA pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry\\nleapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the\\nfootsteps to pass. He heard the man shifting boxes\\nagainst the opposite wall. He might not get another\\nchance —\\nQuickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his\\nhiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back, he\\nsaw an enormous backside and shiny bald head,\\nburied in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of\\nthe stairs, slipped through it, and found himself\\nbehind the counter of Honeydukes — he ducked,\\ncrept sideways, and then straightened up.\\nHoneydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students\\nthat no one looked twice at Harry. He edged among\\nthem, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he\\nimagined the look that would spread over Dudley’s\\npiggy face if he could see where Harry was now.\\nThere were shelves upon shelves of the most\\nsucculent-looking sweets imaginable. Creamy chunks\\nof nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut ice,\\nfat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds\\nof chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of\\nEvery Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees,\\nthe levitating sherbert balls that Ron had mentioned;\\nalong yet another wall were “Special Effects” sweets:\\nDrooble’s Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with\\nbluebell-colored bubbles that refused to pop for days),\\nthe strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny\\nblack Pepper Imps (“breathe fire for your friends!”),\\nIce Mice (“hear your teeth chatter and squeak!”),\\npeppermint creams shaped like toads (“hop\\nrealistically in the stomach!”), fragile sugar-spun\\nquills, and exploding bonbons.\\nHarry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth\\nyears and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of\\n \\nthe shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and Hermione\\nwere standing underneath it, examining a tray of\\nblood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind\\nthem.\\n“Ugh, no, Harry won’t want one of those, they’re for\\nvampires, I expect,” Hermione was saying.\\n“How about these?” said Ron, shoving ajar of\\nCockroach Clusters under Hermione ’s nose.\\n“Definitely not,” said Harry.\\nRon nearly dropped the jar.\\n“Harry\\\\” squealed Hermione. “What are you doing\\nhere? How — how did you — ?”\\n“Wow!” said Ron, looking very impressed, “you’ve\\nlearned to Apparate!”\\n“ ’Course I haven’t,” said Harry. He dropped his voice\\nso that none of the sixth years could hear him and\\ntold them all about the Marauder’s Map.\\n“How come Fred and George never gave it to me!” said\\nRon, outraged. “I’m their brother!”\\n“But Harry isn’t going to keep it!” said Hermione, as\\nthough the idea were ludicrous. “He’s going to hand it\\nin to Professor McGonagall, aren’t you, Harry?”\\n“No, I’m not!” said Harry.\\n“Are you mad?” said Ron, goggling at Hermione.\\n“Hand in something that good?”\\n“If I hand it in, I’ll have to say where I got it! Filch\\nwould know Fred and George had nicked it!”\\n \\n“But what about Sirius Black?” Hermione hissed. “He\\ncould be using one of the passages on that map to get\\ninto the castle! The teachers have got to know!”\\n“He can’t be getting in through a passage,” said Harry\\nquickly. “There are seven secret tunnels on the map,\\nright? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows\\nabout four of them. And of the other three — one of\\nthem’s caved in, so no one can get through it. One of\\nthem’s got the Whomping Willow planted over the\\nentrance, so you can’t get out of it. And the one I just\\ncame through — well — it’s really hard to see the\\nentrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it\\nwas there ...”\\nHarry hesitated. What if Black did know the passage\\nwas there? Ron, however, cleared his throat\\nsignificantly, and pointed to a notice pasted on the\\ninside of the sweetshop door.\\n— BY ORDER OF —\\nTHE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\\nCustomers are reminded that until further notice,\\ndementors will be patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade\\nevery night after sundown. This measure has been put\\nin place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and will\\nbe lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is\\ntherefore advisable that you complete your shopping\\nwell before nightfall.\\nMerry Christmas!\\n“See?” said Ron quietly. “I’d like to see Black try and\\nbreak into Honeydukes with dementors swarming all\\n \\nover the village. Anyway, Hermione, the Honeydukes\\nowners would hear a break-in, wouldn’t they? They\\nlive over the shop!”\\n“Yes, but — but — ” Hermoine seemed to be struggling\\nto find another problem. “Look, Harry still shouldn’t\\nbe coming into Hogsmeade. He hasn’t got a signed\\nform! If anyone finds out, he’ll be in so much trouble!\\nAnd it’s not nightfall yet — what if Sirius Black turns\\nup today? Now?”\\n“He’d have a job spotting Harry in this,” said Ron,\\nnodding through the mullioned windows at the thick,\\nswirling snow. “Come on, Hermione, it’s Christmas.\\nHarry deserves a break.”\\nHermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried.\\n“Are you going to report me?” Harry asked her,\\ngrinning.\\n“Oh — of course not — but honestly, Harry — ”\\n“Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?” said Ron,\\ngrabbing him and leading him over to their barrel.\\n“And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred gave\\nme one of those when I was seven — it burnt a hole\\nright through my tongue. I remember Mum walloping\\nhim with her broomstick.” Ron stared broodingly into\\nthe Acid Pop box. “Reckon Fred’d take a bit of\\nCockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?”\\nWhen Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets,\\nthe three of them left Honeydukes for the blizzard\\noutside.\\nHogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little\\nthatched cottages and shops were all covered in a\\nlayer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the\\n \\ndoors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in\\nthe trees.\\nHarry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn’t have\\nhis cloak. They headed up the street, heads bowed\\nagainst the wind, Ron and Hermione shouting\\nthrough their scarves.\\n“That’s the post office — ”\\n“Zonko’s is up there — ”\\n“We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — ”\\n“Tell you what,” said Ron, his teeth chattering, “shall\\nwe go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?”\\nHarry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and\\nhis hands were freezing, so they crossed the road,\\nand in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.\\nIt was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A\\ncurvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a\\nbunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar.\\n“That’s Madam Rosmerta,” said Ron. “I’ll get the\\ndrinks, shall I?” he added, going slightly red.\\nHarry and Hermione made their way to the back of\\nthe room, where there was a small, vacant table\\nbetween the window and a handsome Christmas tree,\\nwhich stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five\\nminutes later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot\\nbutterbeer.\\n“Merry Christmas!” he said happily, raising his\\ntankard.\\n \\nHarry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing\\nhe’d ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him\\nfrom the inside.\\nA sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the\\nThree Broomsticks had opened again. Harry looked\\nover the rim of his tankard and choked.\\nProfessors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered\\nthe pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed\\nby Hagrid, who was deep in conversation with a portly\\nman in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped\\ncloak — Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.\\nIn an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed\\nhands on the top of Harry’s head and forced him off\\nhis stool and under the table. Dripping with\\nbutterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched\\nhis empty tankard and watched the teachers’ and\\nFudge’s feet move toward the bar, pause, then turn\\nand walk right toward him.\\nSomewhere above him, Hermione whispered,\\n“Mobiliarbus\\\\”\\nThe Christmas tree beside their table rose a few\\ninches off the ground, drifted sideways, and landed\\nwith a soft thump right in front of their table, hiding\\nthem from view. Staring through the dense lower\\nbranches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back\\nfrom the table right beside theirs, then heard the\\ngrunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they\\nsat down.\\nNext he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly\\nturquoise high heels, and heard a woman’s voice.\\n“A small gillywater — ”\\n \\n“Mine,” said Professor McGonagall’s voice.\\n“Four pints of mulled mead — ”\\n“Ta, Rosmerta,” said Hagrid.\\n“A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella — ”\\n“Mmm!” said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.\\n“So you 11 be the red currant rum, Minister.”\\n“Thank you, Rosmerta, m’dear,” said Fudge’s voice.\\n“Lovely to see you again, I must say. Have one\\nyourself, won’t you? Come and join us. ...”\\n“Well, thank you very much, Minister.”\\nHarry watched the glittering heels march away and\\nback again. His heart was pounding uncomfortably in\\nhis throat. Why hadn’t it occurred to him that this\\nwas the last weekend of term for the teachers too?\\nAnd how long were they going to sit there? He needed\\ntime to sneak back into Honeydukes if he wanted to\\nreturn to school tonight. ... Hermione’s leg gave a\\nnervous twitch next to him.\\n“So, what brings you to this neck of the woods,\\nMinister?” came Madam Rosmerta’s voice.\\nHarry saw the lower part of Fudge’s thick body twist\\nin his chair as though he were checking for\\neavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet voice, “What\\nelse, m’dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard\\nwhat happened up at the school at Halloween?”\\n“I did hear a rumor,” admitted Madam Rosmerta.\\n \\n“Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?” said Professor\\nMcGonagall exasperatedly.\\n“Do you think Black’s still in the area, Minister?”\\nwhispered Madam Rosmerta.\\n“I’m sure of it,” said Fudge shortly.\\n“You know that the dementors have searched the\\nwhole village twice?” said Madam Rosmerta, a slight\\nedge to her voice. “Scared all my customers away. ...\\nIt’s very bad for business, Minister.”\\n“Rosmerta, m’dear, I don’t like them any more than\\nyou do,” said Fudge uncomfortably. “Necessary\\nprecaution ... unfortunate, but there you are. ... I’ve\\njust met some of them. They’re in a fury against\\nDumbledore — he won’t let them inside the castle\\ngrounds.”\\n“I should think not,” said Professor McGonagall\\nsharply. “How are we supposed to teach with those\\nhorrors floating around?”\\n“Hear, hear!” squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose\\nfeet were dangling a foot from the ground.\\n“All the same,” demurred Fudge, “they are here to\\nprotect you all from something much worse. ... We all\\nknow what Black’s capable of. ...”\\n“Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,” said\\nMadam Rosmerta thoughtfully. “Of all the people to\\ngo over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I’d\\nhave thought ... I mean, I remember him when he was\\na boy at Hogwarts. If you’d told me then what he was\\ngoing to become, I’d have said you’d had too much\\nmead.”\\n \\n“You don’t know the half of it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge\\ngruffly. “The worst he did isn’t widely known.”\\n“The worst?” said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive\\nwith curiosity. “Worse than murdering all those poor\\npeople, you mean?”\\n“I certainly do,” said Fudge.\\n“I can’t believe that. What could possibly be worse?”\\n“You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,”\\nmurmured Professor McGonagall. “Do you remember\\nwho his best friend was?”\\n“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small\\nlaugh. “Never saw one without the other, did you? The\\nnumber of times I had them in here — ooh, they used\\nto make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black\\nand James Potter!”\\nHarry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron\\nkicked him.\\n“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and\\nPotter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very\\nbright, of course — exceptionally bright, in fact — but\\nI don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of\\ntroublemakers — ”\\n“I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George\\nWeasley could give ’em a run fer their money.”\\n“You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!”\\nchimed in Professor Flitwick. “Inseparable!”\\n“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted\\nBlack beyond all his other friends. Nothing changed\\nwhen they left school. Black was best man when\\n \\nJames married Lily. Then they named him godfather\\nto Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can\\nimagine how the idea would torment him.”\\n“Because Black turned out to be in league with You-\\nKnow-Who?” whispered Madam Rosmerta.\\n“Worse even than that, m’dear. ...” Fudge dropped his\\nvoice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. “Not\\nmany people are aware that the Potters knew You-\\nKnow-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of\\ncourse working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had\\na number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off,\\nand he alerted James and Lily at once. He advised\\nthem to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-\\nWho wasn’t an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore\\ntold them that their best chance was the Fidelius\\nCharm.”\\n“How does that work?” said Madam Rosmerta,\\nbreathless with interest. Professor Flitwick cleared his\\nthroat.\\n“An immensely complex spell,” he said squeakily,\\n“involving the magical concealment of a secret inside\\na single, living soul. The information is hidden inside\\nthe chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is\\nhenceforth impossible to find — unless, of course, the\\nSecret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the\\nSecret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could\\nsearch the village where Lily and James were staying\\nfor years and never find them, not even if he had his\\nnose pressed against their sitting room window!”\\n“So Black was the Potters’ Secret-Keeper?” whispered\\nMadam Rosmerta.\\n“Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “James Potter\\ntold Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell\\n \\nwhere they were, that Black was planning to go into\\nhiding himself . . . and yet, Dumbledore remained\\nworried. I remember him offering to be the Potters’\\nSecret-Keeper himself.”\\n“He suspected Black?” gasped Madam Rosmerta.\\n“He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had\\nbeen keeping You-Know-Who informed of their\\nmovements,” said Professor McGonagall darkly.\\n“Indeed, he had suspected for some time that\\nsomeone on our side had turned traitor and was\\npassing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.”\\n“But James Potter insisted on using Black?”\\n“He did,” said Fudge heavily. “And then, barely a week\\nafter the Fidelius Charm had been performed — ”\\n“Black betrayed them?” breathed Madam Rosmerta.\\n“He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent\\nrole, he was ready to declare his support openly for\\nYou-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this\\nfor the moment of the Potters’ death. But, as we all\\nknow, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry\\nPotter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled. And\\nthis left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His\\nmaster had fallen at the very moment when he, Black,\\nhad shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no\\nchoice but to run for it — ”\\n“Filthy, stinkin’ turncoat!” Hagrid said, so loudly that\\nhalf the bar went quiet.\\n“Shh!” said Professor McGonagall.\\n“I met him!” growled Hagrid. “I musta bin the last ter\\nsee him before he killed all them people! It was me\\n \\nwhat rescued Harry from Lily an’ James’s house after\\nthey was killed! Jus’ got him outta the ruins, poor\\nlittle thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an’\\nhis parents dead ... an’ Sirius Black turns up, on that\\nflyin’ motorbike he used ter ride. Never occurred ter\\nme what he was doin’ there. I didn’ know he’d bin Lily\\nan’ James’s Secret-Keeper. Thought he’d jus’ heard\\nthe news o’ You- Know- Who’s attack an’ come ter see\\nwhat he could do. White an’ shakin’, he was. An’ yeh\\nknow what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN’\\nTRAITOR!” Hagrid roared.\\n“Hagrid, please!” said Professor McGonagall. “Keep\\nyour voice down!”\\n“How was I ter know he wasn’ upset abou’ Lily an’\\nJames? It was You-Know-Who he cared abou’! An’\\nthen he says, ‘Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I’m his\\ngodfather, I’ll look after him — ’ Ha! But I’d had me\\norders from Dumbledore, an’ I told Black no,\\nDumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an’\\nuncle’s. Black argued, but in the end he gave in. Told\\nme ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. ‘I won’t\\nneed it anymore,’ he says.\\n“I shoulda known there was somethin’ fishy goin’ on\\nthen. He loved that motorbike, what was he givin’ it\\nter me for? Why wouldn’ he need it anymore? Fact\\nwas, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he’d\\nbin the Potters’ Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was\\ngoin’ ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a\\nmatter o’ hours before the Ministry was after him.\\n“But what if I’d given Harry to him, eh? I bet he ’d’ve\\npitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes’\\nfriends’ son! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark\\nSide, there’s nothin’ and no one that matters to ’em\\nanymore. ...”\\n \\nA long silence followed Hagrid ’s story. Then Madam\\nRosmerta said with some satisfaction, “But he didn’t\\nmanage to disappear, did he? The Ministry of Magic\\ncaught up with him next day!”\\n“Alas, if only we had,” said Fudge bitterly. “It was not\\nwe who found him. It was little Peter Pettigrew —\\nanother of the Potters’ friends. Maddened by grief, no\\ndoubt, and knowing that Black had been the Potters’\\nSecret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.”\\n“Pettigrew . . . that fat little boy who was always\\ntagging around after them at Hogwarts?” said Madam\\nRosmerta.\\n“Hero-worshipped Black and Potter,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall. “Never quite in their league, talent-wise.\\nI was often rather sharp with him. You can imagine\\nhow I — how I regret that now. ...” She sounded as\\nthough she had a sudden head cold.\\n“There, now, Minerva,” said Fudge kindly, “Pettigrew\\ndied a hero’s death. Eyewitnesses — Muggles, of\\ncourse, we wiped their memories later — told us how\\nPettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing,\\n“Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?’ And then he\\nwent for his wand. Well, of course, Black was quicker.\\nBlew Pettigrew to smithereens. ...”\\nProfessor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly,\\n“Stupid boy . . . foolish boy ... he was always hopeless\\nat dueling ... should have left it to the Ministry. ...”\\n“I tell yeh, if I’d got ter Black before little Pettigrew\\ndid, I wouldn’t’ve messed around with wands — I’d’ve\\nripped him limb — from — limb,” Hagrid growled.\\n“You don’t know what you’re talking about, Hagrid,”\\nsaid Fudge sharply. “Nobody but trained Hit Wizards\\n \\nfrom the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have\\nstood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I\\nwas Junior Minister in the Department of Magical\\nCatastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on\\nthe scene after Black murdered all those people. I — I\\nwill never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A\\ncrater in the middle of the street, so deep it had\\ncracked the sewer below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles\\nscreaming. And Black standing there laughing, with\\nwhat was left of Pettigrew in front of him ... a heap of\\nbloodstained robes and a few — a few fragments — ”\\nFudge’s voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound\\nof five noses being blown.\\n“Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge\\nthickly. “Black was taken away by twenty members of\\nthe Magical Law Enforcement Squad and Pettigrew\\nreceived the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I\\nthink was some comfort to his poor mother. Black’s\\nbeen in Azkaban ever since.”\\nMadam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.\\n“Is it true he’s mad, Minister?”\\n“I wish I could say that he was,” said Fudge slowly. “I\\ncertainly believe his master’s defeat unhinged him for\\na while. The murder of Pettigrew and all those\\nMuggles was the action of a cornered and desperate\\nman — cruel ... pointless. Yet I met Black on my last\\ninspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the\\nprisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the\\ndark; there’s no sense in them ... but I was shocked\\nat how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite\\nrationally to me. It was unnerving. You’d have\\nthought he was merely bored — asked if I’d finished\\nwith my newspaper, cool as you please, said he\\nmissed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at\\n \\nhow little effect the dementors seemed to be having on\\nhim — and he was one of the most heavily guarded in\\nthe place, you know. Dementors outside his door day\\nand night.”\\n“But what do you think he’s broken out to do?” said\\nMadam Rosmerta. “Good gracious, Minister, he isn’t\\ntrying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?”\\n“I daresay that is his — er — eventual plan,” said\\nFudge evasively. “But we hope to catch Black long\\nbefore that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and\\nfriendless is one thing . . . but give him back his most\\ndevoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly\\nhe’ll rise again. ...”\\nThere was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone\\nhad set down their glass.\\n“You know, Cornelius, if you’re dining with the\\nheadmaster, we’d better head back up to the castle,”\\nsaid Professor McGonagall.\\nOne by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the\\nweight of their owners once more; hems of cloaks\\nswung into sight, and Madam Rosemerta’s glittering\\nheels disappeared behind the bar. The door of the\\nThree Broomsticks opened again, there was another\\nflurry of snow, and the teachers had disappeared.\\n“Harry?”\\nRon’s and Hermione’s faces appeared under the table.\\nThey were both staring at him, lost for words.\\n \\nTHE FIREBOLT\\nHarry didn’t have a very clear idea of how he had\\nmanaged to get back into the Honeydukes cellar,\\nthrough the tunnel, and into the castle once more. All\\nhe knew was that the return trip seemed to take no\\ntime at all, and that he hardly noticed what he was\\ndoing, because his head was still pounding with the\\nconversation he had just heard.\\nWhy had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid,\\nMr. Weasley, Cornelius Fudge ... why hadn’t anyone\\never mentioned the fact that Harry’s parents had died\\nbecause their best friend had betrayed them?\\nRon and Hermione watched Harry nervously all\\nthrough dinner, not daring to talk about what they’d\\noverheard, because Percy was sitting close by them.\\nWhen they went upstairs to the crowded common\\nroom, it was to find Fred and George had set off half a\\ndozen Dungbombs in a fit of end-of-term high spirits.\\nHarry, who didn’t want Fred and George asking him\\nwhether he’d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked\\nquietly up to the empty dormitory and headed\\n \\nstraight for his bedside cabinet. He pushed his books\\naside and quickly found what he was looking for —\\nthe leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him\\ntwo years ago, which was full of wizard pictures of his\\nmother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the\\nhangings around him, and started turning the pages,\\nsearching, until ...\\nHe stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day.\\nThere was his father waving up at him, beaming, the\\nuntidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in\\nall directions. There was his mother, alight with\\nhappiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there ...\\nthat must be him. Their best man ... Harry had never\\ngiven him a thought before.\\nIf he hadn’t known it was the same person, he would\\nnever have guessed it was Black in this old\\nphotograph. His face wasn’t sunken and waxy, but\\nhandsome, full of laughter. Had he already been\\nworking for Voldemort when this picture had been\\ntaken? Was he already planning the deaths of the two\\npeople next to him? Did he realize he was facing\\ntwelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would\\nmake him unrecognizable?\\nBut the dementors don’t affect him, Harry thought,\\nstaring into the handsome, laughing face. He doesn’t\\nhave to hear my mum screaming if they get too close —\\nHarry slammed the album shut, reached over and\\nstuffed it back into his cabinet, took off his robe and\\nglasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings\\nwere hiding him from view.\\nThe dormitory door opened.\\n“Harry?” said Ron’s voice uncertainly.\\n \\nBut Harry lay still, pretending to be asleep. He heard\\nRon leave again, and rolled over on his back, his eyes\\nwide open.\\nA hatred such as he had never known before was\\ncoursing through Harry like poison. He could see\\nBlack laughing at him through the darkness, as\\nthough somebody had pasted the picture from the\\nalbum over his eyes. He watched, as though\\nsomebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius\\nBlack blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville\\nLongbottom) into a thousand pieces. He could hear\\n(though having no idea what Black’s voice might\\nsound like) a low, excited mutter. “It has happened,\\nMy Lord . . . the Potters have made me their Secret-\\nKeeper. ...” And then came another voice, laughing\\nshrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his\\nhead whenever the dementors drew near. . . .\\n“Harry, you — you look terrible.”\\nHarry hadn’t gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had\\nawoken to find the dormitory deserted, dressed, and\\ngone down the spiral staircase to a common room\\nthat was completely empty except for Ron, who was\\neating a Peppermint Toad and massaging his\\nstomach, and Hermione, who had spread her\\nhomework over three tables.\\n“Where is everyone?” said Harry.\\n“Gone! It’s the first day of the holidays, remember?”\\nsaid Ron, watching Harry closely. “It’s nearly\\nlunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up in a\\nminute.”\\nHarry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was\\nstill falling outside the windows. Crookshanks was\\nspread out in front of the fire like a large, ginger rug.\\n \\n“You really don’t look well, you know,” Hermione said,\\npeering anxiously into his face.\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry.\\n“Harry, listen,” said Hermione, exchanging a look with\\nRon, “you must be really upset about what we heard\\nyesterday. But the thing is, you mustn’t go doing\\nanything stupid.”\\n“Like what?” said Harry.\\n“Like trying to go after Black,” said Ron sharply.\\nHarry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation\\nwhile he had been asleep. He didn’t say anything.\\n“You won’t, will you, Harry?” said Hermione.\\n“Because Black’s not worth dying for,” said Ron.\\nHarry looked at them. They didn’t seem to\\nunderstand at all.\\n“D’you know what I see and hear every time a\\ndementor gets too near me?” Ron and Hermione\\nshook their heads, looking apprehensive. “I can hear\\nmy mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort.\\nAnd if you’d heard your mum screaming like that,\\njust about to be killed, you wouldn’t forget it in a\\nhurry. And if you found out someone who was\\nsupposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent\\nVoldemort after her — ”\\n“There’s nothing you can do!” said Hermione, looking\\nstricken. “The dementors will catch Black and he’ll go\\nback to Azkaban and — and serve him right!”\\n \\n“You heard what Fudge said. Black isn’t affected by\\nAzkaban like normal people are. It’s not a\\npunishment for him like it is for the others.”\\n“So what are you saying?” said Ron, looking very\\ntense. “You want to — to kill Black or something?”\\n“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione in a panicky voice.\\n“Harry doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you, Harry?”\\nAgain, Harry didn’t answer. He didn’t know what he\\nwanted to do. All he knew was that the idea of doing\\nnothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more\\nthan he could stand.\\n“Malfoy knows,” he said abruptly. “Remember what\\nhe said to me in Potions? ‘If it was me, I’d hunt him\\ndown myself. ... I’d want revenge.’ ”\\n“You’re going to take Malfoy ’s advice instead of ours?”\\nsaid Ron furiously. “Listen ... you know what\\nPettigrew’s mother got back after Black had finished\\nwith him? Dad told me — the Order of Merlin, First\\nClass, and Pettigrew’s finger in a box. That was the\\nbiggest bit of him they could find. Black’s a madman,\\nHarry, and he’s dangerous — ”\\n“Malfoy’s dad must have told him,” said Harry,\\nignoring Ron. “He was right in Voldemort’s inner\\ncircle — ”\\n“ Say You-Knotu-Who, will you?” interjected Ron\\nangrily.\\n“ — so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working\\nfor Voldemort — ”\\n“ — and Malfoy’d love to see you blown into about a\\nmillion pieces, like Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy’s just\\n \\nhoping you 11 get yourself killed before he has to play\\nyou at Quidditch.”\\n“Harry, please,” said Hermione, her eyes now shining\\nwith tears, “please be sensible. Black did a terrible,\\nterrible thing, but d-don’t put yourself in danger, it’s\\nwhat Black wants. ... Oh, Harry, you’d be playing\\nright into Black’s hands if you went looking for him.\\nYour mum and dad wouldn’t want you to get hurt,\\nwould they? They’d never want you to go looking for\\nBlack!”\\n“I’ll never know what they’d have wanted, because\\nthanks to Black, I’ve never spoken to them,” said\\nHarry shortly.\\nThere was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched\\nluxuriously, flexing his claws. Ron’s pocket quivered.\\n“Look,” said Ron, obviously casting around for a\\nchange of subject, “it’s the holidays! It’s nearly\\nChristmas! Let’s — let’s go down and see Hagrid. We\\nhaven’t visited him for ages!”\\n“No!” said Hermione quickly. “Harry isn’t supposed to\\nleave the castle, Ron — ”\\n“Yeah, let’s go,” said Harry, sitting up, “and I can ask\\nhim how come he never mentioned Black when he\\ntold me all about my parents!”\\nFurther discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn’t\\nwhat Ron had had in mind.\\n“Or we could have a game of chess,” he said hastily,\\n“or Gobstones. Percy left a set — ”\\n“No, let’s visit Hagrid,” said Harry firmly.\\n \\nSo they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set\\noff through the portrait hole (“Stand and fight, you\\nyellow-bellied mongrels!”), down through the empty\\ncastle and out through the oak front doors.\\nThey made their way slowly down the lawn, making a\\nshallow trench in the glittering, powdery snow, their\\nsocks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and\\nfreezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it\\nhad been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver,\\nand Hagrid’s cabin looked like an iced cake.\\nRon knocked, but there was no answer.\\n“He’s not out, is he?” said Hermione, who was\\nshivering under her cloak.\\nRon had his ear to the door.\\n“There’s a weird noise,” he said. “Listen — is that\\nFang?”\\nHarry and Hermione put their ears to the door too.\\nFrom inside the cabin came a series of low, throbbing\\nmoans.\\n“Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron\\nnervously.\\n“Hagrid!” called Harry, thumping the door. “Hagrid,\\nare you in there?”\\nThere was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door\\ncreaked open. Hagrid stood there with his eyes red\\nand swollen, tears splashing down the front of his\\nleather vest.\\n“Yeh’ve heard?” he bellowed, and he flung himself\\nonto Harry’s neck.\\n \\nHagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man,\\nthis was no laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse\\nunder Hagrid’s weight, was rescued by Ron and\\nHermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and\\nheaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed\\nhimself to be steered into a chair and slumped over\\nthe table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with\\ntears that dripped down into his tangled beard.\\n“Hagrid, what is it?” said Hermione, aghast.\\nHarry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on\\nthe table.\\n“What’s this, Hagrid?”\\nHagrid’s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter\\ntoward Harry, who picked it up and read aloud:\\nDear Mr. Hagrid,\\nFurther to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on\\na student in your class, we have accepted the\\nassurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no\\nresponsibility for the regrettable incident.\\n“Well, that’s okay then, Hagrid!” said Ron, clapping\\nHagrid on the shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob,\\nand waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting Harry to\\nread on.\\nHowever, we must register our concern about the\\nhippogriff in question. We have decided to uphold the\\nofficial complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy, and this matter\\nwill therefore be taken to the Committee for the\\nDisposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take\\nplace on April 20th, and we ask you to present\\nyourself and your hippogriff at the Committee’s offices\\n \\nin London on that date. In the meantime, the hippogriff\\nshould be kept tethered and isolated.\\nYours in fellowship ...\\nThere followed a list of the school governors.\\n“Oh,” said Ron. “But you said Buckbeak isn’t a bad\\nhippogriff, Hagrid. I bet he’ll get off — ”\\n“Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer\\nthe Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures!” choked Hagrid,\\nwiping his eyes on his sleeve. “They’ve got it in fer\\ninterestin’ creatures!”\\nA sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid ’s cabin\\nmade Harry, Ron, and Hermione whip around.\\nBuckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,\\nchomping on something that was oozing blood all over\\nthe floor.\\n“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!”\\nchoked Hagrid. “All on his own! At Christmas.”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another.\\nThey had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid about\\nwhat he called “interesting creatures” and other\\npeople called “terrifying monsters.” On the other\\nhand, there didn’t seem to be any particular harm in\\nBuckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he\\nwas positively cute.\\n“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,”\\nsaid Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on\\nHagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you can prove\\nBuckbeak is safe.”\\n \\n“Won’t make no difference!” sobbed Hagrid. “Them\\nDisposal devils, they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket!\\nScared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case, Buckbeak — ”\\nHagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then\\ngave a great wail and lurched forward, his face in his\\narms.\\n“What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?” said Harry.\\n“He’s done more’n enough fer me already,” groaned\\nHagrid. “Got enough on his plate what with keepin’\\nthem dementors outta the castle, an’ Sirius Black\\nlurkin’ around — ”\\nRon and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though\\nexpecting him to start berating Hagrid for not telling\\nhim the truth about Black. But Harry couldn’t bring\\nhimself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so\\nmiserable and scared.\\n“Listen, Hagrid,” he said, “you can’t give up.\\nHermione’s right, you just need a good defense. You\\ncan call us as witnesses — ”\\n“I’m sure I’ve read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,”\\nsaid Hermione thoughtfully, “where the hippogriff got\\noff. I’ll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what\\nhappened.”\\nHagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione\\nlooked at Ron to help them.\\n“Er — shall I make a cup of tea?” said Ron.\\nHarry stared at him.\\n“It’s what my mum does whenever someone’s upset,”\\nRon muttered, shrugging.\\n \\nAt last, after many more assurances of help, with a\\nsteaming mug of tea in front of him, Hagrid blew his\\nnose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and\\nsaid, “Yer right. I can’ afford to go ter pieces. Gotta\\npull meself together. ...”\\nFang the boarhound came timidly out from under the\\ntable and laid his head on Hagrid ’s knee.\\n“I’ve not bin meself lately,” said Hagrid, stroking Fang\\nwith one hand and mopping his face with the other.\\n“Worried abou’ Buckbeak, an’ no one likin’ me classes\\n“We do like them!” lied Hermione at once.\\n“Yeah, they’re great!” said Ron, crossing his fingers\\nunder the table. “Er — how are the flobberworms?”\\n“Dead,” said Hagrid gloomily. “Too much lettuce.”\\n“Oh no!” said Ron, his lip twitching.\\n“An’ them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an’\\nall,” said Hagrid, with a sudden shudder. “Gotta walk\\npast ’em ev’ry time I want a drink in the Three\\nBroomsticks. ’S like bein’ back in Azkaban — ”\\nHe fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione watched him breathlessly. They had never\\nheard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban\\nbefore. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, “Is it\\nawful in there, Hagrid?”\\n“Yeh’ve no idea,” said Hagrid quietly. “Never bin\\nanywhere like it. Thought I was goin’ mad. Kep’ goin’\\nover horrible stuff in me mind . . . the day I got\\nexpelled from Hogwarts . . . day me dad died . . . day I\\nhad ter let Norbert go. ...”\\n \\nHis eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby\\ndragon Hagrid had once won in a game of cards.\\n“Yeh can’ really remember who yeh are after a while.\\nAn’ yeh can’ see the point o’ livin’ at all. I used ter\\nhope I’d jus’ die in me sleep. ... When they let me out,\\nit was like bein’ born again, ev’rythin’ came floodin’\\nback, it was the bes’ feelin’ in the world. Mind, the\\ndementors weren’t keen on lettin’ me go.”\\n“But you were innocent!” said Hermione.\\nHagrid snorted.\\n“Think that matters to them? They don’ care. Long as\\nthey’ve got a couple o’ hundred humans stuck there\\nwith ’em, so they can leech all the happiness out of\\n’em, they don’ give a damn who’s guilty an’ who’s\\nnot.”\\nHagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea.\\nThen he said quietly, “Thought o’ jus’ letting\\nBuckbeak go ... tryin’ ter make him fly away ... but\\nhow d’yeh explain ter a hippogriff it’s gotta go inter\\nhidin’? An’ — an’ I’m scared o’ breakin’ the law. ...” He\\nlooked up at them, tears leaking down his face again.\\n“I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.”\\nThe trip to Hagrid’s, though far from fun, had\\nnevertheless had the effect Ron and Hermione had\\nhoped. Though Harry had by no means forgotten\\nabout Black, he couldn’t brood constantly on revenge\\nif he wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the\\nCommittee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione went to the library the next\\nday and returned to the empty common room laden\\nwith books that might help prepare a defense for\\nBuckbeak. The three of them sat in front of the\\nroaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty\\n \\nvolumes about famous cases of marauding beasts,\\nspeaking occasionally when they ran across\\nsomething relevant.\\n“Here’s something ... there was a case in 1722 ... but\\nthe hippogriff was convicted — ugh, look what they\\ndid to it, that’s disgusting — ”\\n“This might help, look — a manticore savaged\\nsomeone in 1296, and they let the manticore off — oh\\n— no, that was only because everyone was too scared\\nto go near it. ...”\\nMeanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual\\nmagnificent Christmas decorations had been put up,\\ndespite the fact that hardly any of the students\\nremained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and\\nmistletoe were strung along the corridors, mysterious\\nlights shone from inside every suit of armor, and the\\nGreat Hall was filled with its usual twelve Christmas\\ntrees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and\\ndelicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and\\nby Christmas Eve, it had grown so strong that even\\nScabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron’s\\npocket to sniff hopefully at the air.\\nOn Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron\\nthrowing his pillow at him.\\n“Oy! Presents!”\\nHarry reached for his glasses and put them on,\\nsquinting through the semi-darkness to the foot of his\\nbed, where a small heap of parcels had appeared. Ron\\nwas already ripping the paper off his own presents.\\n“Another sweater from Mum . . . maroon again . . . see if\\nyou’ve got one.”\\n \\nHarry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet\\nsweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front,\\nalso a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas\\ncake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these\\nthings aside, he saw a long, thin package lying\\nunderneath.\\n“What’s that?” said Ron, looking over, a freshly\\nunwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand.\\n“Dunno ...”\\nHarry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a\\nmagnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his\\nbedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his\\nbed for a closer look.\\n“I don’t believe it,” he said hoarsely.\\nIt was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry\\nhad gone to see every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle\\nglittered as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating\\nand let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly\\nthe right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved\\nfrom the golden registration number at the top of the\\nhandle, right down to the perfectly smooth,\\nstreamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.\\n“Who sent it to you?” said Ron in a hushed voice.\\n“Look and see if there’s a card,” said Harry.\\nRon ripped apart the Firebolt’s wrappings.\\n“Nothing! Blimey, who’d spend that much on you?”\\n“Well,” said Harry, feeling stunned, “I’m betting it\\nwasn’t the Dursleys.”\\n \\n“I bet it was Dumbledore,” said Ron, now walking\\naround and around the Firebolt, taking in every\\nglorious inch. “He sent you the Invisibility Cloak\\nanonymously. ...”\\n“That was my dad’s, though,” said Harry.\\n“Dumbledore was just passing it on to me. He\\nwouldn’t spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can’t\\ngo giving students stuff like this — ”\\n“That’s why he wouldn’t say it was from him!” said\\nRon. “In case some git like Malfoy said it was\\nfavoritism. Hey, Harry” — Ron gave a great whoop of\\nlaughter — “Malfoyl Wait till he sees you on this! He’ll\\nbe sick as a pig! This is an international standard\\nbroom, this is!”\\n“I can’t believe this,” Harry muttered, running a hand\\nalong the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry’s bed,\\nlaughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy. “ Who\\n— ?”\\n“I know,” said Ron, controlling himself, “I know who it\\ncould’ve been — Lupin!”\\n“What?” said Harry, now starting to laugh himself.\\n“Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he’d be able\\nto buy himself some new robes.”\\n“Yeah, but he likes you,” said Ron. “And he was away\\nwhen your Nimbus got smashed, and he might’ve\\nheard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and\\nget this for you — ”\\n“What d’you mean, he was away?” said Harry. “He\\nwas ill when I was playing in that match.”\\n \\n“Well, he wasn’t in the hospital wing,” said Ron. “I\\nwas there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention\\nfrom Snape, remember?”\\nHarry frowned at Ron.\\n“I can’t see Lupin affording something like this.”\\n“What ’re you two laughing about?”\\nHermione had just come in, wearing her dressing\\ngown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking\\nvery grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his\\nneck.\\n“Don’t bring him in here!” said Ron, hurriedly\\nsnatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and\\nstowing him in his pajama pocket. But Hermione\\nwasn’t listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto\\nSeamus’s empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at\\nthe Firebolt.\\n“Oh, Harry\\\\ Who sent you that?”\\n“No idea,” said Harry. “There wasn’t a card or\\nanything with it.”\\nTo his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either\\nexcited or intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her\\nface fell, and she bit her lip.\\n“What’s the matter with you?” said Ron.\\n“I don’t know,” said Hermione slowly, “but it’s a bit\\nodd, isn’t it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a\\ngood broom, isn’t it?”\\nRon sighed exasperatedly.\\n \\n“It’s the best broom there is, Hermione,” he said.\\n“So it must’ve been really expensive. ...”\\n“Probably cost more than all the Slytherins’ brooms\\nput together,” said Ron happily.\\n“Well ... who’d send Harry something as expensive as\\nthat, and not even tell him they’d sent it?” said\\nHermione.\\n“Who cares?” said Ron impatiently. “Listen, Harry,\\ncan I have a go on it? Can I?”\\n“I don’t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!”\\nsaid Hermione shrilly.\\nHarry and Ron looked at her.\\n“What d’you think Harry’s going to do with it — sweep\\nthe floor?” said Ron.\\nBut before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks\\nsprang from Seamus’s bed, right at Ron’s chest.\\n“GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE!” Ron bellowed\\nas Crookshanks ’s claws ripped his pajamas and\\nScabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder.\\nRon seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a\\nmisjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at\\nthe end of Harry’s bed, knocking it over and causing\\nRon to hop up and down, howling with pain.\\nCrookshanks ’s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill,\\ntinny whistling was filling the room. The Pocket\\nSneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle\\nVernon’s old socks and was whirling and gleaming on\\nthe floor.\\n \\n“I forgot about that!” Harry said, bending down and\\npicking up the Sneakoscope. “I never wear those\\nsocks if I can help it. ...”\\nThe Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm.\\nCrookshanks was hissing and spitting at it.\\n“You’d better take that cat out of here, Hermione,”\\nsaid Ron furiously, sitting on Harry’s bed nursing his\\ntoe. “Can’t you shut that thing up?” he added to\\nHarry as Hermione strode out of the room,\\nCrookshanks ’s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on\\nRon.\\nHarry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks\\nand threw it back into his trunk. All that could be\\nheard now were Ron’s stifled moans of pain and rage.\\nScabbers was huddled in Ron’s hands. It had been a\\nwhile since Harry had seen him out of Ron’s pocket,\\nand he was unpleasantly surprised to see that\\nScabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches\\nof fur seemed to have fallen out too.\\n“He’s not looking too good, is he?” Harry said.\\n“It’s stress!” said Ron. “He’d be fine if that big stupid\\nfurball left him alone!”\\nBut Harry, remembering what the woman at the\\nMagical Menagerie had said about rats living only\\nthree years, couldn’t help feeling that unless Scabbers\\nhad powers he had never revealed, he was reaching\\nthe end of his life. And despite Ron’s frequent\\ncomplaints that Scabbers was both boring and\\nuseless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if\\nScabbers died.\\nChristmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in\\nthe Gryffindor common room that morning. Hermione\\n \\nhad shut Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was\\nfurious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was still\\nfuming about Crookshanks ’s fresh attempt to eat\\nScabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to\\neach other and devoted himself to examining the\\nFirebolt, which he had brought down to the common\\nroom with him. For some reason this seemed to\\nannoy Hermione as well; she didn’t say anything, but\\nshe kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too\\nhad been criticizing her cat.\\nAt lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to\\nfind that the House tables had been moved against\\nthe walls again, and that a single table, set for twelve,\\nstood in the middle of the room. Professors\\nDumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and\\nFlitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker,\\nwho had taken off his usual brown coat and was\\nwearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat.\\nThere were only three other students, two extremely\\nnervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced\\nSlytherin fifth year.\\n“Merry Christmas!” said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione approached the table. “As there are so\\nfew of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables.\\n... Sit down, sit down!”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at\\nthe end of the table.\\n“Crackers!” said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering\\nthe end of a large silver noisemaker to Snape, who\\ntook it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang like a\\ngunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large,\\npointed witch’s hat topped with a stuffed vulture.\\nHarry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron’s eye\\nand they both grinned; Snape ’s mouth thinned and\\n \\nhe pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped\\nit for his wizard’s hat at once.\\n“Dig in!” he advised the table, beaming around.\\nAs Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the\\ndoors of the Great Hall opened again. It was Professor\\nTrelawney, gliding toward them as though on wheels.\\nShe had put on a green sequined dress in honor of\\nthe occasion, making her look more than ever like a\\nglittering, oversized dragonfly.\\n“Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!” said Dumbledore,\\nstanding up.\\n“I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,” said\\nProfessor Trelawney in her mistiest, most faraway\\nvoice, “and to my astonishment, I saw myself\\nabandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join\\nyou. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at\\nonce hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to\\nforgive my lateness. ...”\\n“Certainly, certainly,” said Dumbledore, his eyes\\ntwinkling. “Let me draw you up a chair — ”\\nAnd he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his\\nwand, which revolved for a few seconds before falling\\nwith a thud between Professors Snape and\\nMcGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit\\ndown; her enormous eyes had been roving around the\\ntable, and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream.\\n“I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be\\nthirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget\\nthat when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will\\nbe the first to die!”\\n \\n“Well risk it, Sibyll,” said Professor McGonagall\\nimpatiently. “Do sit down, the turkey’s getting stone\\ncold.”\\nProfessor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself\\ninto the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched\\ntight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the\\ntable. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into\\nthe nearest tureen.\\n“Tripe, Sibyll?”\\nProfessor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again,\\nshe looked around once more and said, “But where is\\ndear Professor Lupin?”\\n“I’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,” said\\nDumbledore, indicating that everybody should start\\nserving themselves. “Most unfortunate that it should\\nhappen on Christmas Day.”\\n“But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?” said\\nProfessor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised.\\nProfessor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very\\ncold look.\\n“Certainly I knew, Minerva,” she said quietly. “But\\none does not parade the fact that one is All-Knowing.\\nI frequently act as though I am not possessed of the\\nInner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.”\\n“That explains a great deal,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall tartly.\\nProfessor Trelawney’s voice suddenly became a good\\ndeal less misty.\\n \\n“If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor\\nProfessor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He\\nseems aware, himself, that his time is short. He\\npositively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him —\\n“Imagine that,” said Professor McGonagall dryly.\\n“I doubt,” said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly\\nraised voice, which put an end to Professor\\nMcGonagall and Professor Trelawney’s conversation,\\n“that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger.\\nSeverus, you’ve made the potion for him again?”\\n“Yes, Headmaster,” said Snape.\\n“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Then he should be up and\\nabout in no time. ... Derek, have you had any of these\\nchipolatas? They’re excellent.”\\nThe first-year boy went furiously red on being\\naddressed directly by Dumbledore, and took the\\nplatter of sausages with trembling hands.\\nProfessor Trelawney behaved almost normally until\\nthe very end of Christmas dinner, two hours later.\\nFull to bursting with Christmas dinner and still\\nwearing their party hats, Harry and Ron got up first\\nfrom the table and she shrieked loudly.\\n“My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?”\\n“Dunno,” said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry.\\n“I doubt it will make much difference,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall coldly, “unless a mad axe-man is waiting\\noutside the doors to slaughter the first into the\\nentrance hall.”\\n \\nEven Ron laughed. Professor Trelawney looked highly\\naffronted.\\n“Coming?” Harry said to Hermione.\\n“No,” Hermione muttered, “I want a quick word with\\nProfessor McGonagall.”\\n“Probably trying to see if she can take any more\\nclasses,” yawned Ron as they made their way into the\\nentrance hall, which was completely devoid of mad\\naxe-men.\\nWhen they reached the portrait hole, they found Sir\\nCadogan enjoying a Christmas party with a couple of\\nmonks, several previous headmasters of Hogwarts,\\nand his fat pony. He pushed up his visor and toasted\\nthem with a flagon of mead.\\n“Merry — hie — Christmas! Password?”\\n“Scurvy cur,” said Ron.\\n“And the same to you, sir!” roared Sir Cadogan as the\\npainting swung forward to admit them.\\nHarry went straight up to the dormitory, collected the\\nFirebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione\\nhad given him for his birthday, brought them\\ndownstairs, and tried to find something to do to the\\nFirebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip,\\nand the handle was so shiny already it seemed\\npointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring\\nit from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and\\nHermione came in, accompanied by Professor\\nMcGonagall.\\nThough Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor\\nHouse, Harry had seen her in the common room only\\n \\nonce before, and that had been to make a very grave\\nannouncement. He and Ron stared at her, both\\nholding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around them,\\nsat down, picked up the nearest book, and hid her\\nface behind it.\\n“So that’s it, is it?” said Professor McGonagall beadily,\\nwalking over to the fireside and staring at the\\nFirebolt. “Miss Granger has just informed me that you\\nhave been sent a broomstick, Potter.”\\nHarry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They\\ncould see her forehead reddening over the top of her\\nbook, which was upside down.\\n“May I?” said Professor McGonagall, but she didn’t\\nwait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of\\ntheir hands. She examined it carefully from handle to\\ntwig-ends. “Hmm. And there was no note at all,\\nPotter? No card? No message of any kind?”\\n“No,” said Harry blankly.\\n“I see ... ,” said Professor McGonagall. “Well, I’m\\nafraid I will have to take this, Potter.”\\n“W — what?” said Harry, scrambling to his feet.\\n“Why?”\\n“It will need to be checked for jinxes,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall. “Of course, I’m no expert, but I daresay\\nMadam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it\\ndown — ”\\n“Strip it down?” repeated Ron, as though Professor\\nMcGonagall was mad.\\n \\n“It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall. “You will have it back if we are\\nsure it is jinx-free.”\\n“There’s nothing wrong with it!” said Harry, his voice\\nshaking slightly. “Honestly, Professor — ”\\n“You can’t know that, Potter,” said Professor\\nMcGonagall, quite kindly, “not until you’ve flown it, at\\nany rate, and I’m afraid that is out of the question\\nuntil we are certain that it has not been tampered\\nwith. I shall keep you informed.”\\nProfessor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried\\nthe Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed\\nbehind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of\\nHigh-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron,\\nhowever, rounded on Hermione.\\n“What did you go running to McGonagall for?”\\nHermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in\\nthe face, but stood up and faced Ron defiantly.\\n“Because I thought — and Professor McGonagall\\nagrees with me — that that broom was probably sent\\nto Harry by Sirius Black!”\\n \\nTHE PATRONUS\\nHarry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that\\ndidn’t stop him from being angry with her. He had\\nbeen the owner of the best broom in the world for a\\nfew short hours, and now, because of her\\ninterference, he didn’t know whether he would ever\\nsee it again. He was positive that there was nothing\\nwrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state\\nwould it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts\\nof anti-jinx tests?\\nRon was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was\\nconcerned, the stripping-down of a brand-new\\nFirebolt was nothing less than criminal damage.\\nHermione, who remained convinced that she had\\nacted for the best, started avoiding the common room.\\nHarry and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the\\nlibrary and didn’t try to persuade her to come back.\\nAll in all, they were glad when the rest of the school\\nreturned shortly after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower\\nbecame crowded and noisy again.\\n \\nWood sought Harry out on the night before term\\nstarted.\\n“Had a good Christmas?” he said, and then, without\\nwaiting for an answer, he sat down, lowered his voice,\\nand said, “I’ve been doing some thinking over\\nChristmas, Harry. After the last match, you know. If\\nthe dementors come to the next one ... I mean . . . we\\ncan’t afford you to — well — ”\\nWood broke off, looking awkward.\\n“I’m working on it,” said Harry quickly. “Professor\\nLupin said he’d train me to ward off the dementors.\\nWe should be starting this week. He said he’d have\\ntime after Christmas.”\\n“Ah,” said Wood, his expression clearing. “Well, in\\nthat case — I really didn’t want to lose you as Seeker,\\nHarry. And have you ordered a new broom yet?”\\n“No,” said Harry.\\n“What! You’d better get a move on, you know — you\\ncan’t ride that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!”\\n“He got a Firebolt for Christmas,” said Ron.\\n“A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A — a real Firebolt?”\\n“Don’t get excited, Oliver,” said Harry gloomily. “I\\nhaven’t got it anymore. It was confiscated.” And he\\nexplained all about how the Firebolt was now being\\nchecked for jinxes.\\n“Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?”\\n \\n“Sirius Black,” Harry said wearily. “He’s supposed to\\nbe after me. So McGonagall reckons he might have\\nsent it.”\\nWaving aside the information that a famous murderer\\nwas after his Seeker, Wood said, “But Black couldn’t\\nhave bought a Firebolt! He’s on the run! The whole\\ncountry’s on the lookout for him! How could he just\\nwalk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a\\nbroomstick?”\\n“I know,” said Harry, “but McGonagall still wants to\\nstrip it down — ”\\nWood went pale.\\n“I’ll go and talk to her, Harry,” he promised. “I’ll make\\nher see reason. ... A Firebolt ... a real Firebolt, on our\\nteam . . . She wants Gryffindor to win as much as we\\ndo. ... I’ll make her see sense. A Firebolt ...”\\nClasses started again the next day. The last thing\\nanyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the\\ngrounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had\\nprovided a bonfire full of salamanders for their\\nenjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson\\ncollecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing\\nwhile the flame-loving lizards scampered up and\\ndown the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first\\nDivination lesson of the new term was much less fun;\\nProfessor Trelawney was now teaching them\\npalmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry\\nthat he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.\\nIt was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was\\nkeen to get to; after his conversation with Wood, he\\nwanted to get started on his anti-dementor lessons as\\nsoon as possible.\\n \\n“Ah yes,” said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his\\npromise at the end of class. “Let me see ... how about\\neight o’clock on Thursday evening? The History of\\nMagic classroom should be large enough. ... I’ll have\\nto think carefully about how we’re going to do this. ...\\nWe can’t bring a real dementor into the castle to\\npractice on. ...”\\n“Still looks ill, doesn’t he?” said Ron as they walked\\ndown the corridor, heading to dinner. “What d’you\\nreckon ’s the matter with him?”\\nThere was a loud and impatient “tuh” from behind\\nthem. It was Hermione, who had been sitting at the\\nfeet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag, which was\\nso full of books it wouldn’t close.\\n“And what are you tutting at us for?” said Ron\\nirritably.\\n“Nothing,” said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her\\nbag back over her shoulder.\\n“Yes, you were,” said Ron. “I said I wonder what’s\\nwrong with Lupin, and you — ”\\n“Well, isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, with a look of\\nmaddening superiority.\\n“If you don’t want to tell us, don’t,” snapped Ron.\\n“Fine,” said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.\\n“She doesn’t know,” said Ron, staring resentfully after\\nHermione. “She’s just trying to get us to talk to her\\nagain.”\\nAt eight o’clock on Thursday evening, Harry left\\nGryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom.\\n \\nIt was dark and empty when he arrived, but he lit the\\nlamps with his wand and had waited only five\\nminutes when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a\\nlarge packing case, which he heaved onto Professor\\nBinns’ desk.\\n“What’s that?” said Harry.\\n“Another boggart,” said Lupin, stripping off his cloak.\\n“I’ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and\\nvery luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch’s\\nfiling cabinet. It’s the nearest we’ll get to a real\\ndementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when\\nhe sees you, so we’ll be able to practice on him. I can\\nstore him in my office when we’re not using him;\\nthere’s a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”\\n“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he\\nwasn’t apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin\\nhad found such a good substitute for a real dementor.\\n“So ...” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand,\\nand indicated that Harry should do the same. “The\\nspell I am going to try and teach you is highly\\nadvanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary\\nWizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.”\\n“How does it work?” said Harry nervously.\\n“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a\\nPatronus,” said Lupin, “which is a kind of anti-\\ndementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between\\nyou and the dementor.”\\nHarry had a sudden vision of himself crouching\\nbehind a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club.\\nProfessor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a kind of\\npositive force, a projection of the very things that the\\ndementor feeds upon — hope, happiness, the desire\\n \\nto survive — but it cannot feel despair, as real\\nhumans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I\\nmust warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too\\nadvanced for you. Many qualified wizards have\\ndifficulty with it.”\\n“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry\\ncuriously.\\n“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”\\n“And how do you conjure it?”\\n“With an incantation, which will work only if you are\\nconcentrating, with all your might, on a single, very\\nhappy memory.”\\nHarry cast his mind about for a happy memory.\\nCertainly, nothing that had happened to him at the\\nDursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled on the\\nmoment when he had first ridden a broomstick.\\n“Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible\\nthe wonderful, soaring sensation of his stomach.\\n“The incantation is this — ” Lupin cleared his throat.\\n“Expecto patronum).”\\n“Expecto patronum,” Harry repeated under his breath,\\n“expecto patronum.”\\n“Concentrating hard on your happy memory?”\\n“Oh — yeah — ” said Harry, quickly forcing his\\nthoughts back to that first broom ride. “Expecto\\npatrono — no, patronum — sorry — expecto patronum,\\nexpecto patronum — ”\\n \\nSomething whooshed suddenly out of the end of his\\nwand; it looked like a wisp of silvery gas.\\n“Did you see that?” said Harry excitedly. “Something\\nhappened!”\\n“Very good,” said Lupin, smiling. “Right, then — ready\\nto try it on a dementor?”\\n“Yes,” Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and\\nmoving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He\\ntried to keep his mind on flying, but something else\\nkept intruding. . . . Any second now, he might hear his\\nmother again . . . but he shouldn’t think that, or he\\nwould hear her again, and he didn’t want to ... or did\\nhe?\\nLupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.\\nA dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face\\nturned toward Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand\\ngripping its cloak. The lamps around the classroom\\nflickered and went out. The dementor stepped from\\nthe box and started to sweep silently toward Harry,\\ndrawing a deep, rattling breath. A wave of piercing\\ncold broke over him —\\n“Expecto patronurrd” Harry yelled. “Expecto patronum).\\nExpecto — ”\\nBut the classroom and the dementor were dissolving.\\n. . . Harry was falling again through thick white fog,\\nand his mother’s voice was louder than ever, echoing\\ninside his head — “ Not Harry\\\\ Not Harry\\\\ Please — I’ll\\ndo anything — ”\\n“Stand aside. Stand aside, girl\\\\”\\n“Harry!”\\n \\nHarry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back\\non the floor. The classroom lamps were alight again.\\nHe didn’t have to ask what had happened.\\n“Sorry,” he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat\\ntrickling down behind his glasses.\\n“Are you all right?” said Lupin.\\n“Yes ...” Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks\\nand leaned against it.\\n“Here — ” Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. “Eat\\nthis before we try again. I didn’t expect you to do it\\nyour first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if\\nyou had.”\\n“It’s getting worse,” Harry muttered, biting off the\\nFrog’s head. “I could hear her louder that time — and\\nhim — Voldemort — ”\\nLupin looked paler than usual.\\n“Harry, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than\\nunderstand — ”\\n“I do!” said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the\\nChocolate Frog into his mouth. “I’ve got to! What if\\nthe dementors turn up at our match against\\nRavenclaw? I can’t afford to fall off again. If we lose\\nthis game we’ve lost the Quidditch Cup!”\\n“All right then ... ,” said Lupin. “You might want to\\nselect another memory, a happy memory, I mean, to\\nconcentrate on. ... That one doesn’t seem to have\\nbeen strong enough. ...”\\nHarry thought hard and decided his feelings when\\nGryffindor had won the House Championship last\\n \\nyear had definitely qualified as very happy. He\\ngripped his wand tightly again and took up his\\nposition in the middle of the classroom.\\n“Ready?” said Lupin, gripping the box lid.\\n“Ready,” said Harry, trying hard to fill his head with\\nhappy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not\\ndark thoughts about what was going to happen when\\nthe box opened.\\n“Go!” said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went\\nicily cold and dark once more. The dementor glided\\nforward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was\\nextending toward Harry —\\n“Expecto patronum).” Harry yelled. “Expecto patronuml\\nExpecto pat — ”\\nWhite fog obscured his senses . . . big, blurred shapes\\nwere moving around him ... then came a new voice, a\\nman’s voice, shouting, panicking —\\n“Lily, take Harry and go\\\\ It’s him\\\\ Go! Run\\\\ I’ll hold him\\noff~\\nThe sounds of someone stumbling from a room — a\\ndoor bursting open — a cackle of high-pitched\\nlaughter —\\n“Harry! Harry ... wake up. ...”\\nLupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time\\nit was a minute before Harry understood why he was\\nlying on a dusty classroom floor.\\n“I heard my dad,” Harry mumbled. “That’s the first\\ntime I’ve ever heard him — he tried to take on\\n \\nVoldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it.\\nHarry suddenly realized that there were tears on his\\nface mingling with the sweat. He bent his face as low\\nas possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending\\nto do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn’t see.\\n“You heard James?” said Lupin in a strange voice.\\n“Yeah ...” Face dry, Harry looked up. “Why — you\\ndidn’t know my dad, did you?”\\n“I — I did, as a matter of fact,” said Lupin. “We were\\nfriends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry — perhaps we\\nshould leave it here for tonight. This charm is\\nridiculously advanced. ... I shouldn’t have suggested\\nputting you through this. ...”\\n“No!” said Harry. He got up again. “I’ll have one more\\ngo! I’m not thinking of happy enough things, that’s\\nwhat it is. ... Hang on. ...”\\nHe racked his brains. A really, really happy memory\\n. . . one that he could turn into a good, strong\\nPatronus ...\\nThe moment when he’d first found out he was a\\nwizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for\\nHogwarts! If that wasn’t a happy memory, he didn’t\\nknow what was. ... Concentrating very hard on how\\nhe had felt when he’d realized he’d be leaving Privet\\nDrive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case\\nonce more.\\n“Ready?” said Lupin, who looked as though he were\\ndoing this against his better judgment.\\n“Concentrating hard? All right — go!”\\n \\nHe pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and\\nthe dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and\\ndark —\\n“EXPECTO PATRONUM ” Harry bellowed. “ EXPECTO\\nPATRONUM EXPECTO PATRONUM ”\\nThe screaming inside Harry’s head had started again\\n— except this time, it sounded as though it were\\ncoming from a badly tuned radio — softer and louder\\nand softer again — and he could still see the\\ndementor — it had halted — and then a huge, silver\\nshadow came bursting out of the end of Harry’s wand,\\nto hover between him and the dementor, and though\\nHarry’s legs felt like water, he was still on his feet —\\nthough for how much longer, he wasn’t sure —\\n“ RiddikulusV’ roared Lupin, springing forward.\\nThere was a loud crack, and Harry’s cloudy Patronus\\nvanished along with the dementor; he sank into a\\nchair, feeling as exhausted as if he’d just run a mile,\\nand felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye,\\nhe saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into\\nthe packing case with his wand; it had turned into a\\nsilvery orb again.\\n“Excellent!” Lupin said, striding over to where Harry\\nsat. “Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!”\\n“Can we have another go? Just one more go?”\\n“Not now,” said Lupin firmly. “You’ve had enough for\\none night. Here — ”\\nHe handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes’ best\\nchocolate.\\n \\n“Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood.\\nSame time next week?”\\n“Okay,” said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate\\nand watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had\\nrekindled with the disappearance of the dementor. A\\nthought had just occurred to him.\\n“Professor Lupin?” he said. “If you knew my dad, you\\nmust’ve known Sirius Black as well.”\\nLupin turned very quickly.\\n“What gives you that idea?” he said sharply.\\n“Nothing — I mean, I just knew they were friends at\\nHogwarts too. ...”\\nLupin’s face relaxed.\\n“Yes, I knew him,” he said shortly. “Or I thought I did.\\nYou’d better be off, Harry, it’s getting late.”\\nHarry left the classroom, walking along the corridor\\nand around a corner, then took a detour behind a\\nsuit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish\\nhis chocolate, wishing he hadn’t mentioned Black, as\\nLupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then\\nHarry’s thoughts wandered back to his mother and\\nfather. ...\\nHe felt drained and strangely empty, even though he\\nwas so full of chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear\\nhis parents’ last moments replayed inside his head,\\nthese were the only times Harry had heard their\\nvoices since he was a very small child. But he’d never\\nbe able to produce a proper Patronus if he half\\nwanted to hear his parents again. ...\\n \\n“They’re dead,” he told himself sternly. “They’re dead\\nand listening to echoes of them won’t bring them\\nback. You’d better get a grip on yourself if you want\\nthat Quidditch Cup.”\\nHe stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into\\nhis mouth, and headed back to Gryffindor Tower.\\nRavenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of\\nterm. Slytherin won, though narrowly. According to\\nWood, this was good news for Gryffindor, who would\\ntake second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He\\ntherefore increased the number of team practices to\\nfive a week. This meant that with Lupin’s anti-\\ndementor classes, which in themselves were more\\ndraining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just\\none night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he\\nwasn’t showing the strain nearly as much as\\nHermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to\\nbe getting to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione\\nwas to be seen in a corner of the common room,\\nseveral tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts,\\nrune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy\\nobjects, and file upon file of extensive notes; she\\nbarely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was\\ninterrupted.\\n“How’s she doing it?” Ron muttered to Harry one\\nevening as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on\\nUndetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up.\\nHermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of\\nbooks.\\n“Doing what?”\\n“Getting to all her classes!” Ron said. “I heard her\\ntalking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch,\\nthis morning. They were going on about yesterday’s\\nlesson, but Hermione can’t’ve been there, because she\\n \\nwas with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie\\nMcMillan told me she’s never missed a Muggle\\nStudies class, but half of them are at the same time\\nas Divination, and she’s never missed one of them\\neither!”\\nHarry didn’t have time to fathom the mystery of\\nHermione’s impossible schedule at the moment; he\\nreally needed to get on with Snape’s essay. Two\\nseconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this\\ntime by Wood.\\n“Bad news, Harry. I’ve just been to see Professor\\nMcGonagall about the Firebolt. She — er — got a bit\\nshirty with me. Told me I’d got my priorities wrong.\\nSeemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup\\nthan I do about you staying alive. Just because I told\\nher I didn’t care if it threw you off, as long as you\\ncaught the Snitch first.” Wood shook his head in\\ndisbelief. “Honestly, the way she was yelling at me . . .\\nyou’d think I’d said something terrible. ... Then I\\nasked her how much longer she was going to keep it.\\n...” He screwed up his face and imitated Professor\\nMcGonagall’s severe voice. “ ‘As long as necessary,\\nWood’ ... I reckon it’s time you ordered a new broom,\\nHarry. There’s an order form at the back of Which\\nBroomstick ... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand\\nand One, like Malfoy’s got.”\\n“I’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,” said\\nHarry flatly.\\nJanuary faded imperceptibly into February, with no\\nchange in the bitterly cold weather. The match\\nagainst Ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer,\\nbut Harry still hadn’t ordered a new broom. He was\\nnow asking Professor McGonagall for news of the\\nFirebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, Ron\\n \\nstanding hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione rushing\\npast with her face averted.\\n“No, Potter, you can’t have it back yet,” Professor\\nMcGonagall told him the twelfth time this happened,\\nbefore he’d even opened his mouth. “We’ve checked\\nfor most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick\\nbelieves the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I\\nshall tell you once we’ve finished checking it. Now,\\nplease stop badgering me.”\\nTo make matters even worse, Harry’s anti-dementor\\nlessons were not going nearly as well as he had\\nhoped. Several sessions on, he was able to produce\\nan indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-\\ndementor approached him, but his Patronus was too\\nfeeble to drive the dementor away. All it did was\\nhover, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining Harry\\nof energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt\\nangry with himself, guilty about his secret desire to\\nhear his parents’ voices again.\\n“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said\\nProfessor Lupin sternly in their fourth week of\\npractice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an\\nindistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t\\npassing out anymore, are you?”\\n“I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors\\ndown or something,” said Harry dispiritedly. “Make\\nthem disappear — ”\\n“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But\\nyou’ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of\\ntime. If the dementors put in an appearance at your\\nnext Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them\\nat bay long enough to get back to the ground.”\\n \\n“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said\\nHarry.\\n“I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin,\\nsmiling. “Here — you’ve earned a drink — something\\nfrom the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have tried it\\nbefore — ”\\nHe pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.\\n“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I\\nlike that stuff!”\\nLupin raised an eyebrow.\\n“Oh — Ron and Hermione brought me some back\\nfrom Hogsmeade,” Harry lied quickly.\\n“I see,” said Lupin, though he still looked slightly\\nsuspicious. “Well — let’s drink to a Gryffindor victory\\nagainst Ravenclaw! Not that I’m supposed to take\\nsides, as a teacher ... ,” he added hastily.\\nThey drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry\\nvoiced something he’d been wondering for a while.\\n“What’s under a dementor’s hood?”\\nProfessor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.\\n“Hmmm ... well, the only people who really know are\\nin no condition to tell us. You see, the dementor\\nlowers its hood only to use its last and worst\\nweapon.”\\n“What’s that?”\\n“They call it the Dementor’s Kiss,” said Lupin, with a\\nslightly twisted smile. “It’s what dementors do to\\n \\nthose they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there\\nmust be some kind of mouth under there, because\\nthey clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim\\nand — and suck out his soul.”\\nHarry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.\\n“What — they kill — ?”\\n“Oh no,” said Lupin. “Much worse than that. You can\\nexist without your soul, you know, as long as your\\nbrain and heart are still working. But you 11 have no\\nsense of self anymore, no memory, no ... anything.\\nThere’s no chance at all of recovery. You’ll just —\\nexist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever\\n... lost.”\\nLupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, “It’s\\nthe fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily\\nProphet this morning. The Ministry have given the\\ndementors permission to perform it if they find him.”\\nHarry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of\\nsomeone having their soul sucked out through their\\nmouth. But then he thought of Black.\\n“He deserves it,” he said suddenly.\\n“You think so?” said Lupin lightly. “Do you really\\nthink anyone deserves that?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry defiantly. “For ... for some things ...”\\nHe would have liked to have told Lupin about the\\nconversation he’d overheard about Black in the Three\\nBroomsticks, about Black betraying his mother and\\nfather, but it would have involved revealing that he’d\\ngone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew\\nLupin wouldn’t be very impressed by that. So he\\n \\nfinished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the\\nHistory of Magic classroom.\\nHarry half wished that he hadn’t asked what was\\nunder a dementor’s hood, the answer had been so\\nhorrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of\\nwhat it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of\\nyou that he walked headlong into Professor\\nMcGonagall halfway up the stairs.\\n“Do watch where you’re going, Potter!”\\n“Sorry, Professor — ”\\n“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor\\ncommon room. Well, here it is, we’ve done everything\\nwe could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be\\nanything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good\\nfriend somewhere, Potter. ...”\\nHarry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his\\nFirebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever.\\n“I can have it back?” Harry said weakly. “Seriously?”\\n“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall, and she was\\nactually smiling. “I daresay you’ll need to get the feel\\nof it before Saturday’s match, won’t you? And Potter\\n— do try and win, won’t you? Or we’ll be out of the\\nrunning for the eighth year in a row, as Professor\\nSnape was kind enough to remind me only last night.\\nSpeechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs\\ntoward Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a corner, he\\nsaw Ron dashing toward him, grinning from ear to\\near.\\n \\n“She gave it to you? Excellent! Listen, can I still have\\na go on it? Tomorrow?”\\n“Yeah ... anything ... said Harry, his heart lighter\\nthan it had been in a month. “You know what — we\\nshould make up with Hermione. ... She was only\\ntrying to help. ...”\\n“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. “She’s in the common\\nroom now — working, for a change — ”\\nThey turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and\\nsaw Neville Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan,\\nwho seemed to be refusing him entrance.\\n“I wrote them down!” Neville was saying tearfully.\\n“But I must’ve dropped them somewhere!”\\n“A likely tale!” roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting\\nHarry and Ron: “Good even, my fine young yeomen!\\nCome clap this loon in irons. He is trying to force\\nentry to the chambers within!”\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Ron as he and Harry drew level\\nwith Neville.\\n“I’ve lost the passwords!” Neville told them miserably.\\n“I made him tell me what passwords he was going to\\nuse this week, because he keeps changing them, and\\nnow I don’t know what I’ve done with them!”\\n“Oddsbodikins,” said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who\\nlooked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung\\nforward to let them into the common room. There was\\na sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and\\nthe next moment, Harry was surrounded by people\\nexclaiming over his Firebolt.\\n“Where ’d you get it, Harry?”\\n \\n“Will you let me have a go?”\\n“Have you ridden it yet, Harry?”\\n“Ravenclaw’ll have no chance, they’re all on\\nCleansweep Sevens!”\\n“Can I just hold it, Harry?”\\nAfter ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was\\npassed around and admired from every angle, the\\ncrowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a clear view\\nof Hermione, the only person who hadn’t rushed over\\nto them, bent over her work and carefully avoiding\\ntheir eyes. Harry and Ron approached her table and\\nat last, she looked up.\\n“I got it back,” said Harry, grinning at her and holding\\nup the Firebolt.\\n“See, Hermione? There wasn’t anything wrong with\\nit!” said Ron.\\n“Well — there might have been!” said Hermione. “I\\nmean, at least you know now that it’s safe!”\\n“Yeah, I suppose so,” said Harry. “I’d better put it\\nupstairs — ”\\n“I’ll take it!” said Ron eagerly. “I’ve got to give\\nScabbers his rat tonic.”\\nHe took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made\\nof glass, carried it away up the boys’ staircase.\\n“Can I sit down, then?” Harry asked Hermione.\\n“I suppose so,” said Hermione, moving a great stack\\nof parchment off a chair.\\n \\nHarry looked around at the cluttered table, at the\\nlong Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still\\nglistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay\\n(“Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity”) and at the\\nrune translation Hermione was now poring over.\\n“How are you getting through all this stuff?” Harry\\nasked her.\\n“Oh, well — you know — working hard,” said\\nHermione. Close-up, Harry saw that she looked\\nalmost as tired as Lupin.\\n“Why don’t you just drop a couple of subjects?” Harry\\nasked, watching her lifting books as she searched for\\nher rune dictionary.\\n“I couldn’t do that!” said Hermione, looking\\nscandalized.\\n“Arithmancy looks terrible,” said Harry, picking up a\\nvery complicated-looking number chart.\\n“Oh no, it’s wonderful!” said Hermione earnestly. “It’s\\nmy favorite subject! It’s — ”\\nBut exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy,\\nHarry never found out. At that precise moment, a\\nstrangled yell echoed down the boys’ staircase. The\\nwhole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at\\nthe entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing\\nlouder and louder — and then Ron came leaping into\\nview, dragging with him a bedsheet.\\n“LOOK!” he bellowed, striding over to Hermione’s\\ntable. “LOOK!” he yelled, shaking the sheets in her\\nface.\\n“Ron, what — ?”\\n \\n“SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!”\\nHermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly\\nbewildered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was\\nholding. There was something red on it. Something\\nthat looked horribly like —\\n“BLOOD!” Ron yelled into the stunned silence. “HE’S\\nGONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE\\nFLOOR?”\\n“N — no,” said Hermione in a trembling voice.\\nRon threw something down onto Hermione ’s rune\\ntranslation. Hermione and Harry leaned forward.\\nLying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several\\nlong, ginger cat hairs.\\n \\nGRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW\\nIt looked like the end of Ron and Hermione’s\\nfriendship. Each was so angry with the other that\\nHarry couldn’t see how they’d ever make up.\\nRon was enraged that Hermione had never taken\\nCrookshanks’s attempts to eat Scabbers seriously,\\nhadn’t bothered to keep a close enough watch on him,\\nand was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was\\ninnocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers\\nunder all the boys’ beds. Hermione, meanwhile,\\nmaintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that\\nCrookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger\\nhairs might have been there since Christmas, and\\nthat Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever\\nsince Crookshanks had landed on Ron’s head in the\\nMagical Menagerie.\\nPersonally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had\\neaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to\\nHermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she\\nlost her temper with Harry too.\\n \\n“Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!” she said\\nshrilly. “First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything’s\\nmy fault, isn’t it! Just leave me alone, Harry, I’ve got a\\nlot of work to do!”\\nRon had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.\\n“Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring\\nScabbers was,” said Fred bracingly “And he’s been\\noff-color for ages, he was wasting away. It was\\nprobably better for him to snuff it quickly — one\\nswallow — he probably didn’t feel a thing.”\\n“Fred\\\\” said Ginny indignantly.\\n“All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it\\nyourself,” said George.\\n“He bit Goyle for us once!” Ron said miserably.\\n“Remember, Harry?”\\n“Yeah, that’s true,” said Harry.\\n“His finest hour,” said Fred, unable to keep a straight\\nface. “Let the scar on Goyle ’s finger stand as a lasting\\ntribute to his memory. Oh, come on, Ron, get yourself\\ndown to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what’s the\\npoint of moaning?”\\nIn a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry\\npersuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team’s\\nfinal practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he\\ncould have a ride on the Firebolt after they’d finished.\\nThis did seem to take Ron’s mind off Scabbers for a\\nmoment (“Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on\\nit?”) so they set off for the Quidditch field together.\\nMadam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor\\npractices to keep an eye on Harry, was just as\\n \\nimpressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had\\nbeen. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave\\nthem the benefit of her professional opinion.\\n“Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a\\nfault, it’s a slight list to the tail end — you often find\\nthey develop a drag after a few years. They’ve updated\\nthe handle too, a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps,\\nreminds me of the old Silver Arrows — a pity they’ve\\nstopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a\\nvery fine old broom it was too. ...”\\nShe continued in this vein for some time, until Wood\\nsaid, “Er — Madam Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the\\nFirebolt back? We need to practice. ...”\\n“Oh — right — here you are, then, Potter,” said\\nMadam Hooch. “I’ll sit over here with Weasley ...”\\nShe and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and\\nthe Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his\\nfinal instructions for tomorrow’s match.\\n“Harry, I’ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing\\nas Seeker. It’s Cho Chang. She’s a fourth year, and\\nshe’s pretty good. ... I really hoped she wouldn’t be fit,\\nshe’s had some problems with injuries. ...” Wood\\nscowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a\\nfull recovery, then said, “On the other hand, she rides\\na Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke\\nnext to the Firebolt.” He gave Harry’s broom a look of\\nfervent admiration, then said, “Okay, everyone, let’s\\ngo\\nAnd at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and\\nkicked off from the ground.\\nIt was better than he’d ever dreamed. The Firebolt\\nturned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his\\n \\nthoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field\\nat such speed that the stadium turned into a green-\\nand-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia\\nSpinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly\\ncontrolled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes\\nbefore rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again —\\n“Harry, I’m letting the Snitch out!” Wood called.\\nHarry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal\\nposts; he outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart\\nout from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had\\ncaught it tightly in his hand.\\nThe team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go\\nagain, gave it a minute’s head start, then tore after it,\\nweaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking\\nnear Katie Bell’s knee, looped her easily, and caught\\nit again.\\nIt was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by\\nthe presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed\\ntheir best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit\\nthe ground again, Wood didn’t have a single criticism\\nto make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a\\nfirst.\\n“I can’t see what’s going to stop us tomorrow!” said\\nWood. “Not unless — Harry, you’ve sorted out your\\ndementor problem, haven’t you?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus\\nand wishing it were stronger.\\n“The dementors won’t turn up again, Oliver.\\nDumbledore’d go ballistic,” said Fred confidently.\\n \\n“Well, let’s hope not,” said Wood. “Anyway — good\\nwork, everyone. Let’s get back to the tower ... turn in\\nearly — ”\\n“I’m staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the\\nFirebolt,” Harry told Wood, and while the rest of the\\nteam headed off to the locker rooms, Harry strode\\nover to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands\\nand came to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen\\nasleep in her seat.\\n“Here you go,” said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.\\nRon, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted\\nthe broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness\\nwhile Harry walked around the edge of the field,\\nwatching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch\\nawoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not\\nwaking her, and insisted that they go back to the\\ncastle.\\nHarry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked\\nout of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt’s\\nsuperbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration,\\nand its pinpoint turning. They were halfway toward\\nthe castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw\\nsomething that made his heart turn over — a pair of\\neyes, gleaming out of the darkness.\\nHarry stopped dead, his heart banging against his\\nribs.\\n“What’s the matter?” said Ron.\\nHarry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and\\nmuttered, “Lumos\\\\”\\n \\nA beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of\\na tree, and illuminated its branches; there, crouching\\namong the budding leaves, was Crookshanks.\\n“Get out of here!” Ron roared, and he stooped down\\nand seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he\\ncould do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished\\nwith one swish of his long ginger tail.\\n“See?” Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down\\nagain. “She’s still letting him wander about wherever\\nhe wants — probably washing down Scabbers with a\\ncouple of birds now. ...”\\nHarry didn’t say anything. He took a deep breath as\\nrelief seeped through him; he had been sure for a\\nmoment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim.\\nThey set off for the castle once more. Slightly\\nashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn’t say\\nanything to Ron — nor did he look left or right until\\nthey had reached the well-lit entrance hall.\\nHarry went down to breakfast the next morning with\\nthe rest of the boys in his dormitory, all of whom\\nseemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard\\nof honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads\\nturned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there was\\na good deal of excited muttering. Harry saw, with\\nenormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin team were\\nall looking thunderstruck.\\n“Did you see his face?” said Ron gleefully, looking\\nback at Malfoy. “He can’t believe it! This is brilliant!”\\nWood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the\\nFirebolt.\\n“Put it here, Harry,” he said, laying the broom in the\\nmiddle of the table and carefully turning it so that its\\n \\nname faced upward. People from the Ravenclaw and\\nHufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look.\\nCedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on\\nhaving acquired such a superb replacement for his\\nNimbus, and Percy’s Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope\\nClearwater, asked if she could actually hold the\\nFirebolt.\\n“Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!” said Percy heartily\\nas she examined the Firebolt closely “Penelope and I\\nhave got a bet on,” he told the team. “Ten Galleons on\\nthe outcome of the match!”\\nPenelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry,\\nand went back to her table.\\n“Harry — make sure you win,” said Percy, in an\\nurgent whisper. “I haven’t got ten Galleons. Yes, I’m\\ncoming, Penny!” And he bustled off to join her in a\\npiece of toast.\\n“Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?” said a\\ncold, drawling voice.\\nDraco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe\\nand Goyle right behind him.\\n“Yeah, reckon so,” said Harry casually.\\n“Got plenty of special features, hasn’t it?” said Malfoy,\\neyes glittering maliciously. “Shame it doesn’t come\\nwith a parachute — in case you get too near a\\ndementor.”\\nCrabbe and Goyle sniggered.\\n“Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,”\\nsaid Harry. “Then it could catch the Snitch for you.”\\n \\nThe Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy’s pale\\neyes narrowed, and he stalked away. They watched\\nhim rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put\\ntheir heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether\\nHarry’s broom really was a Firebolt.\\nAt a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for\\nthe locker rooms. The weather couldn’t have been\\nmore different from their match against Hufflepuff. It\\nwas a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there\\nwould be no visibility problems this time, and Harry,\\nthough nervous, was starting to feel the excitement\\nonly a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear\\nthe rest of the school moving into the stadium\\nbeyond. Harry took off his black school robes,\\nremoved his wand from his pocket, and stuck it\\ninside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his\\nQuidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn’t need it.\\nHe wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was\\nin the crowd, watching.\\n“You know what we’ve got to do,” said Wood as they\\nprepared to leave the locker rooms. “If we lose this\\nmatch, we’re out of the running. Just — just fly like\\nyou did in practice yesterday, and we’ll be okay!”\\nThey walked out onto the field to tumultuous\\napplause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were\\nalready standing in the middle of the field. Their\\nSeeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team.\\nShe was shorter than Harry by about a head, and\\nHarry couldn’t help noticing, nervous as he was, that\\nshe was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the\\nteams faced each other behind their captains, and he\\nfelt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he\\ndidn’t think had anything to do with nerves.\\n \\n“Wood, Davies, shake hands,” Madam Hooch said\\nbriskly, and Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw\\nCaptain.\\n“Mount your brooms ... on my whistle . . . three — two\\n— one — ”\\nHarry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed\\nhigher and faster than any other broom; he soared\\naround the stadium and began squinting around for\\nthe Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary,\\nwhich was being provided by the Weasley twins’\\nfriend Lee Jordan.\\n“They’re off, and the big excitement this match is the\\nFirebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor.\\nAccording to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt’s going to\\nbe the broom of choice for the national teams at this\\nyear’s World Championship — ”\\n“Jordan, would you mind telling us what’s going on in\\nthe match?” interrupted Professor McGonagall’s voice.\\n“Right you are, Professor — just giving a bit of\\nbackground information — the Firebolt, incidentally,\\nhas a built-in auto-brake and — ”\\n“Jordan!”\\n“Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of\\nGryffindor heading for goal ...”\\nHarry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction,\\ngazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho\\nChang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly\\na very good flier — she kept cutting across him,\\nforcing him to change direction.\\n \\n“Show her your acceleration, Harry!” Fred yelled as he\\nwhooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was\\naiming for Alicia.\\nHarry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the\\nRavenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. Just as\\nKatie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match,\\nand the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw\\nit — the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near\\none of the barriers.\\nHarry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore\\nafter him — Harry was speeding up, excitement\\nflooding him; dives were his speciality, he was ten feet\\naway —\\nThen a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters,\\ncame pelting out of nowhere; Harry veered off course,\\navoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial\\nseconds, the Snitch had vanished.\\nThere was a great “Ooooooh” of disappointment from\\nthe Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for\\ntheir Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley\\nvented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger\\ndirectly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll\\nright over in midair to avoid it.\\n“Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at\\nthat Firebolt go! Potter’s really putting it through its\\npaces now, see it turn — Chang’s Comet is just no\\nmatch for it, the Firebolt’s precision-balance is really\\nnoticeable in these long — ”\\n“JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE\\nFIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!”\\nRavenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored\\nthree goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty points\\n \\nahead — if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw\\nwould win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a\\nRavenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically — a\\nglint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings — the Snitch was\\ncircling the Gryffindor goal post —\\nHarry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold\\nahead — but just then, Cho appeared out of thin air,\\nblocking him —\\n“HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!”\\nWood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision.\\n“KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!”\\nHarry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was\\ngrinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry\\nturned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet\\nabove the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw\\nCho following him. ... She’d decided to mark him\\nrather than search for the Snitch herself. . . . All right,\\nthen ... if she wanted to tail him, she’d have to take\\nthe consequences. ...\\nHe dived again, and Cho, thinking he’d seen the\\nSnitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the dive\\nvery sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a\\nbullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time\\n— the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the\\nRavenclaw end.\\nHe accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was\\nwinning, gaining on the Snitch with every second —\\nthen —\\n“Oh!” screamed Cho, pointing.\\nDistracted, Harry looked down.\\n \\nThree dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors,\\nwere looking up at him.\\nHe didn’t stop to think. Plunging a hand down the\\nneck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and\\nroared, “Expecto patronum).”\\nSomething silver-white, something enormous, erupted\\nfrom the end of his wand. He knew it had shot\\ndirectly at the dementors but didn’t pause to watch;\\nhis mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead —\\nhe was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still\\ngrasping his wand and just managed to close his\\nfingers over the small, struggling Snitch.\\nMadam Hooch’s whistle sounded. Harry turned\\naround in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing\\ndown on him; next moment, the whole team was\\nhugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his\\nbroom. Down below he could hear the roars of the\\nGryffindors in the crowd.\\n“That’s my boy!” Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina,\\nand Katie had all kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip\\nso tight Harry felt as though his head would come off.\\nIn complete disarray, the team managed to make its\\nway back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and\\nlooked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters\\nsprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he\\nknew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.\\n“Yes!” Ron yelled, yanking Harry’s arm into the air.\\n“Yes! Yes!”\\n“Well done, Harry!” said Percy, looking delighted. “Ten\\nGalleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me — ”\\n“Good for you, Harry!” roared Seamus Finnigan.\\n \\n“Ruddy brilliant!” boomed Hagrid over the heads of\\nthe milling Gryffindors.\\n“That was quite some Patronus,” said a voice in\\nHarry’s ear.\\nHarry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who\\nlooked both shaken and pleased.\\n“The dementors didn’t affect me at all!” Harry said\\nexcitedly. “I didn’t feel a thing!”\\n“That would be because they — er — weren’t\\ndementors,” said Professor Lupin. “Come and see — ”\\nHe led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to\\nsee the edge of the field.\\n“You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,” said Lupin.\\nHarry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground\\nwere Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the\\nSlytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove\\nthemselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked\\nas though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle ’s\\nshoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of\\nthe utmost fury on her face, was Professor\\nMcGonagall.\\n“An unworthy trick!” she was shouting. “A low and\\ncowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker!\\nDetention for all of you, and fifty points from\\nSlytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor\\nDumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here\\nhe comes now!”\\nIf anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor’s\\nvictory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his way\\nthrough to Harry’s side, doubled up with laughter as\\n \\nthey watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from\\nthe robe, Goyle’s head still stuck inside it.\\n“Come on, Harry!” said George, fighting his way over.\\n“Party! Gryffindor common room, now!”\\n“Right,” said Harry, and feeling happier than he had\\nin ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still\\nin their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up\\nto the castle.\\nIt felt as though they had already won the Quidditch\\nCup; the party went on all day and well into the night.\\nFred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of\\nhours and returned with armfuls of bottles of\\nbutterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of\\nHoneydukes sweets.\\n“How did you do that?” squealed Angelina Johnson as\\nGeorge started throwing Peppermint Toads into the\\ncrowd.\\n“With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and\\nProngs,” Fred muttered in Harry’s ear.\\nOnly one person wasn’t joining in the festivities.\\nHermione, incredibly, was sitting in a corner,\\nattempting to read an enormous book entitled Home\\nLife and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke\\naway from the table where Fred and George had\\nstarted juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to\\nher.\\n“Did you even come to the match?” he asked her.\\n“Of course I did,” said Hermione in a strangely high-\\npitched voice, not looking up. “And I’m very glad we\\n \\nwon, and I think you did really well, but I need to\\nread this by Monday.”\\n“Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,”\\nHarry said, looking over at Ron and wondering\\nwhether he was in a good enough mood to bury the\\nhatchet.\\n“I can’t, Harry. I’ve still got four hundred and twenty-\\ntwo pages to read!” said Hermione, now sounding\\nslightly hysterical. “Anyway ...” She glanced over at\\nRon too. “He doesn’t want me to join in.”\\nThere was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that\\nmoment to say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn’t just been\\neaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies.\\nHe used to really like them — ”\\nHermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or\\ndo anything, she tucked the enormous book under\\nher arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase\\nto the girls’ dormitories and out of sight.\\n“Can’t you give her a break?” Harry asked Ron\\nquietly.\\n“No,” said Ron flatly. “If she just acted like she was\\nsorry — but she’ll never admit she’s wrong, Hermione.\\nShe’s still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation\\nor something.”\\nThe Gryffindor party ended only when Professor\\nMcGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown\\nand hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they\\nall go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to\\ntheir dormitory, still discussing the match. At last,\\nexhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the\\nhangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of\\n \\nmoonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly\\ndrifting off to sleep. ...\\nHe had a very strange dream. He was walking\\nthrough a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder,\\nfollowing something silvery- white. It was winding its\\nway through the trees ahead, and he could only catch\\nglimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up\\nwith it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his\\nquarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard\\nhooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out,\\nand ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a\\ncorner into a clearing and —\\n“AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH\\n! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”\\nHarry woke as suddenly as though he’d been hit in\\nthe face. Disoriented in the total darkness, he\\nfumbled with his hangings — he could hear\\nmovements around him, and Seamus Finnigan’s voice\\nfrom the other side of the room: “What’s going on?”\\nHarry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At\\nlast finding the divide in his curtains, he ripped them\\nback, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his\\nlamp.\\nRon was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one\\nside, a look of utmost terror on his face.\\n“Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!”\\n“What?”\\n“Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!”\\n“You sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?” said Dean.\\n \\n“Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!”\\nThey all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the\\ndormitory door first, and they sprinted back down the\\nstaircase. Doors opened behind them, and sleepy\\nvoices called after them.\\n“Who shouted?”\\n“What ’re you doing?”\\nThe common room was lit with the glow of the dying\\nfire, still littered with the debris from the party. It was\\ndeserted.\\n“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?”\\n“I’m telling you, I saw him!”\\n“What’s all the noise?”\\n“Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!”\\nA few of the girls had come down their staircase,\\npulling on dressing gowns and yawning. Boys, too,\\nwere reappearing.\\n“Excellent, are we carrying on?” said Fred Weasley\\nbrightly.\\n“Everyone back upstairs!” said Percy,\\nhurrying into the common room and pinning his\\nHead Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.\\n“Perce — Sirius Black!” said Ron faintly. “In our\\ndormitory! With a knife! Woke me up!”\\nThe common room went very still.\\n \\n“Nonsense!” said Percy, looking startled. “You had too\\nmuch to eat, Ron — had a nightmare — ”\\n“I’m telling you — ”\\n“Now, really, enough’s enough!”\\nProfessor McGonagall was back. She slammed the\\nportrait behind her as she entered the common room\\nand stared furiously around.\\n“I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but\\nthis is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of\\nyou!”\\n“I certainly didn’t authorize this, Professor!” said\\nPercy, puffing himself up indignantly. “I was just\\ntelling them all to get back to bed! My brother Ron\\nhere had a nightmare — ”\\n“IT WASNT A NIGHTMARE!” Ron yelled.\\n“PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS\\nSTANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!”\\nProfessor McGonagall stared at him.\\n“Don’t be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly\\nhave gotten through the portrait hole?”\\n“Ask him!” said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the\\nback of Sir Cadogan’s picture. “Ask him if he saw — ”\\nGlaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall\\npushed the portrait back open and went outside. The\\nwhole common room listened with bated breath.\\n“Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor\\nTower?”\\n \\n“Certainly, good lady!” cried Sir Cadogan.\\nThere was a stunned silence, both inside and outside\\nthe common room.\\n“You — you did?” said Professor McGonagall. “But —\\nbut the password!”\\n“He had ’em!” said Sir Cadogan proudly. “Had the\\nwhole week’s, my lady! Read ’em off a little piece of\\npaper!”\\nProfessor McGonagall pulled herself back through the\\nportrait hole to face the stunned crowd. She was\\nwhite as chalk.\\n“Which person,” she said, her voice shaking, “which\\nabysmally foolish person wrote down this week’s\\npasswords and left them lying around?”\\nThere was utter silence, broken by the smallest of\\nterrified squeaks. Neville Longbottom, trembling from\\nhead to fluffy-slippered toes, raised his hand slowly\\ninto the air.\\n \\nSNAPE’S GRUDGE\\nNo one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They\\nknew that the castle was being searched again, and\\nthe whole House stayed awake in the common room,\\nwaiting to hear whether Black had been caught.\\nProfessor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell\\nthem that he had again escaped.\\nThroughout the day, everywhere they went they saw\\nsigns of tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be\\nseen teaching the front doors to recognize a large\\npicture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling\\nup and down the corridors, boarding up everything\\nfrom tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir\\nCadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken\\nback to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and\\nthe Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly\\nrestored, but was still extremely nervous, and had\\nagreed to return to her job only on condition that she\\nwas given extra protection. A bunch of surly security\\ntrolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the\\ncorridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and\\ncomparing the size of their clubs.\\n \\nHarry couldn’t help noticing that the statue of the\\none-eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded\\nand unblocked. It seemed that Fred and George had\\nbeen right in thinking that they — and now Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione — were the only ones who knew\\nabout the hidden passageway within it.\\n“D’you reckon we should tell someone?” Harry asked\\nRon.\\n“We know he’s not coming in through Honey duke’s,”\\nsaid Ron dismissively “We’d’ve heard if the shop had\\nbeen broken into.”\\nHarry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed\\nwitch was boarded up too, he would never be able to\\ngo into Hogsmeade again.\\nRon had become an instant celebrity. For the first\\ntime in his life, people were paying more attention to\\nhim than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was\\nrather enjoying the experience. Though still severely\\nshaken by the night’s events, he was happy to tell\\nanyone who asked what had happened, with a wealth\\nof detail.\\n\"... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I\\nthought it was in my dream, you know? But then\\nthere was this draft ... I woke up and one side of the\\nhangings on my bed had been pulled down. ... I rolled\\nover . . . and I saw him standing over me . . . like a\\nskeleton, with loads of filthy hair . . . holding this great\\nlong knife, must’ve been twelve inches ... and he\\nlooked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled,\\nand he scampered.\\n“Why, though?” Ron added to Harry as the group of\\nsecond-year girls who had been listening to his\\nchilling tale departed. “Why did he run?”\\n \\nHarry had been wondering the same thing. Why had\\nBlack, having got the wrong bed, not silenced Ron\\nand proceeded to Harry? Black had proved twelve\\nyears ago that he didn’t mind murdering innocent\\npeople, and this time he had been facing five\\nunarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.\\n“He must’ve known he’d have a job getting back out of\\nthe castle once you’d yelled and woken people up,”\\nsaid Harry thoughtfully. “He’d’ve had to kill the whole\\nHouse to get back through the portrait hole . . . then\\nhe would’ve met the teachers. ...”\\nNeville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall\\nwas so furious with him she had banned him from all\\nfuture Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and\\nforbidden anyone to give him the password into the\\ntower. Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the\\ncommon room every night for somebody to let him in,\\nwhile the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him.\\nNone of these punishments, however, came close to\\nmatching the one his grandmother had in store for\\nhim. Two days after Black’s break-in, she sent Neville\\nthe very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive\\nover breakfast — a Howler.\\nThe school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying\\nthe mail as usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn\\nowl landed in front of him, a scarlet envelope clutched\\nin its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite\\nhim, recognized the letter as a Howler at once — Ron\\nhad got one from his mother the year before.\\n“Run for it, Neville,” Ron advised.\\nNeville didn’t need telling twice. He seized the\\nenvelope, and holding it before him like a bomb,\\nsprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table\\nexploded with laughter at the sight of him. They\\n \\nheard the Howler go off in the entrance hall —\\nNeville’s grandmother’s voice, magically magnified to\\na hundred times its usual volume, shrieking about\\nhow he had brought shame on the whole family.\\nHarry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice\\nimmediately that he had a letter too. Hedwig got his\\nattention by nipping him sharply on the wrist.\\n“Ouch! Oh — thanks, Hedwig.”\\nHarry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped\\nherself to some of Neville’s cornflakes. The note inside\\nsaid:\\nDear Harry and Ron,\\nHow about having tea with me this afternoon ’round\\nsix?\\nI’ll come and collect you from the castle.\\nWAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL;\\nYOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN\\nCheers,\\nHagrid\\n“He probably wants to hear all about Black!” said\\nRon.\\nSo at six o’clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left\\nGryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls at a run,\\nand headed down to the entrance hall.\\nHagrid was already waiting for them.\\n \\n“All right, Hagrid!” said Ron. “S’pose you want to hear\\nabout Saturday night, do you?”\\n“I’ve already heard all abou’ it,” said Hagrid, opening\\nthe front doors and leading them outside.\\n“Oh,” said Ron, looking slightly put out.\\nThe first thing they saw on entering Hagrid’s cabin\\nwas Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of\\nHagrid’s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded\\ntight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead\\nferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight,\\nHarry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very\\nhorrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of\\nHagrid’s wardrobe door.\\n“What are they for, Hagrid?” said Harry.\\n“Buckbeak’s case against the Committee fer the\\nDisposal o’ Dangerous Creatures,” said Hagrid. “This\\nFriday. Him an’ me’ll be goin’ down ter London\\ntogether. I’ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus. ...”\\nHarry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely\\nforgotten that Buckbeak’s trial was so near, and\\njudging by the uneasy look on Ron’s face, he had too.\\nThey had also forgotten their promise about helping\\nhim prepare Buckbeak’s defense; the arrival of the\\nFirebolt had driven it clean out of their minds.\\nHagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of\\nBath buns, but they knew better than to accept; they\\nhad had too much experience with Hagrid’s cooking.\\n“I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two,” said\\nHagrid, sitting himself between them and looking\\nuncharacteristically serious.\\n \\n“What?” said Harry.\\n“Hermione,” said Hagrid.\\n“What about her?” said Ron.\\n“She’s in a righ’ state, that’s what. She’s bin cornin’\\ndown ter visit me a lot since Chris ’mas. Bin feelin’\\nlonely. Firs’ yeh weren’ talking to her because o’ the\\nFirebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her because her cat — ”\\n“ — ate Scabbers!” Ron interjected angrily.\\n“Because her cat acted like all cats do,” Hagrid\\ncontinued doggedly. “She’s cried a fair few times, yeh\\nknow. Goin’ through a rough time at the moment.\\nBitten off more’n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the\\nwork she’s tryin’ ter do. Still found time ter help me\\nwith Buckbeak’s case, mind. ... She’s found some\\nreally good stuff fer me ... reckon he’ll stand a good\\nchance now. ...”\\n“Hagrid, we should’ve helped as well — sorry — ”\\nHarry began awkwardly.\\n“I’m not blamin’ yeh!” said Hagrid, waving Harry’s\\napology aside. “Gawd knows yeh’ve had enough ter be\\ngettin’ on with. I’ve seen yeh practicin’ Quidditch ev’ry\\nhour o’ the day an’ night — but I gotta tell yeh, I\\nthought you two’d value yer friend more’n\\nbroomsticks or rats. Tha’s all.”\\nHarry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.\\n“Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed\\nyeh, Ron. She’s got her heart in the right place,\\nHermione has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her — ”\\n \\n“If she’d just get rid of that cat, I’d speak to her\\nagain!” Ron said angrily. “But she’s still sticking up\\nfor it! It’s a maniac, and she won’t hear a word\\nagainst it!”\\n“Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou’ their pets,”\\nsaid Hagrid wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few\\nferret bones onto Hagrid’s pillow.\\nThey spent the rest of their visit discussing\\nGryffindor’s improved chances for the Quidditch Cup.\\nAt nine o’clock, Hagrid walked them back up to the\\ncastle.\\nA large group of people was bunched around the\\nbulletin board when they returned to the common\\nroom.\\n“Hogsmeade, next weekend!” said Ron, craning over\\nthe heads to read the new notice. “What d’you\\nreckon?” he added quietly to Harry as they went to sit\\ndown.\\n“Well, Filch hasn’t done anything about the passage\\ninto Honeydukes. ...” Harry said, even more quietly.\\n“Harry!” said a voice in his right ear. Harry started\\nand looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at\\nthe table right behind them and clearing a space in\\nthe wall of books that had been hiding her.\\n“Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again ... I’ll tell\\nProfessor McGonagall about that map!” said\\nHermione.\\n“Can you hear someone talking, Harry?” growled Ron,\\nnot looking at Hermione.\\n \\n“Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what\\nSirius Black nearly did to youl I mean it, I’ll tell — ”\\n“So now you’re trying to get Harry expelled!” said Ron\\nfuriously. “Haven’t you done enough damage this\\nyear?”\\nHermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a\\nsoft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione\\ntook one frightened look at the expression on Ron’s\\nface, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away\\ntoward the girls’ dormitories.\\n“So how about it?” Ron said to Harry as though there\\nhad been no interruption. “Come on, last time we\\nwent you didn’t see anything. You haven’t even been\\ninside Zonko’s yet!”\\nHarry looked around to check that Hermione was well\\nout of earshot.\\n“Okay,” he said. “But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak\\nthis time.”\\nOn Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility\\nCloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder’s Map into his\\npocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone\\nelse. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down\\nthe table at him, but he avoided her eye and was\\ncareful to let her see him walking back up the marble\\nstaircase in the entrance hall as everybody else\\nproceeded to the front doors.\\n“ ’Bye!” Harry called to Ron. “See you when you get\\nback!”\\nRon grinned and winked.\\n \\nHarry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the\\nMarauder’s Map out of his pocket as he went.\\nCrouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it\\nout. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry\\nsquinted at it. The minuscule writing next to it read\\nNeville Longbottom.\\nHarry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered,\\n“ Dissendium).” and shoved his bag into the statue, but\\nbefore he could climb in himself, Neville came around\\nthe corner.\\n“Harry! I forgot you weren’t going to Hogsmeade\\neither!”\\n“Hi, Neville,” said Harry, moving swiftly away from the\\nstatue and pushing the map back into his pocket.\\n“What are you up to?”\\n“Nothing,” shrugged Neville. “Want a game of\\nExploding Snap?”\\n“Er — not now — I was going to go to the library and\\ndo that vampire essay for Lupin — ”\\n“I’ll come with you!” said Neville brightly. “I haven’t\\ndone it either!”\\n“Er — hang on — yeah, I forgot, I finished it last\\nnight!”\\n“Great, you can help me!” said Neville, his round face\\nanxious. “I don’t understand that thing about the\\ngarlic at all — do they have to eat it, or — ”\\nHe broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry’s\\nshoulder.\\nIt was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.\\n \\n“And what are you two doing here?” said Snape,\\ncoming to a halt and looking from one to the other.\\n“An odd place to meet — ”\\nTo Harry’s immense disquiet, Snape’s black eyes\\nflicked to the doorways on either side of them, and\\nthen to the one-eyed witch.\\n“We’re not — meeting here,” said Harry. “We just —\\nmet here.”\\n“Indeed?” said Snape. “You have a habit of turning up\\nin unexpected places, Potter, and you are very rarely\\nthere for no good reason. ... I suggest the pair of you\\nreturn to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.”\\nHarry and Neville set off without another word. As\\nthey turned the corner, Harry looked back. Snape was\\nrunning one of his hands over the one-eyed witch’s\\nhead, examining it closely.\\nHarry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by\\ntelling him the password, then pretending he’d left his\\nvampire essay in the library and doubling back. Once\\nout of sight of the security trolls, he pulled out the\\nmap again and held it close to his nose.\\nThe third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry\\nscanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of\\nrelief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus Snape was\\nnow back in its office.\\nHe sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her\\nhump, heaved himself inside, and slid down to meet\\nhis bag at the bottom of the stone chute. He wiped\\nthe Marauder’s Map blank again, then set off at a\\nrun.\\n \\nHarry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility\\nCloak, emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes\\nand prodded Ron in the back.\\n“It’s me,” he muttered.\\n“What kept you?” Ron hissed.\\n“Snape was hanging around. ...”\\nThey set off up the High Street.\\n“Where are you?” Ron kept muttering out of the\\ncorner of his mouth. “Are you still there? This feels\\nweird. ...”\\nThey went to the post office; Ron pretended to be\\nchecking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that\\nHarry could have a good look around. The owls sat\\nhooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of\\nthem; from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops\\nowls (“Local Deliveries Only”), which were so small\\nthey could have sat in the palm of Harry’s hand.\\nThen they visited Zonko’s, which was so packed with\\nstudents Harry had to exercise great care not to tread\\non anyone and cause a panic. There were jokes and\\ntricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s wildest\\ndreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed\\nhim some gold from under the cloak. They left\\nZonko’s with their money bags considerably lighter\\nthan they had been on entering, but their pockets\\nbulging with Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn\\nSoap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece.\\nThe day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt\\nlike staying indoors, so they walked past the Three\\nBroomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the\\nShrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in\\n \\nBritain. It stood a little way above the rest of the\\nvillage, and even in daylight was slightly creepy, with\\nits boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.\\n“Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,” said Ron as they\\nleaned on the fence, looking up at it. “I asked Nearly\\nHeadless Nick ... he says he’s heard a very rough\\ncrowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George\\ntried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut.\\nHarry, feeling hot from their climb, was just\\nconsidering taking off the cloak for a few minutes\\nwhen they heard voices nearby. Someone was\\nclimbing toward the house from the other side of the\\nhill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed\\nclosely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was speaking.\\n\"... should have an owl from Father any time now. He\\nhad to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm . . .\\nabout how I couldn’t use it for three months. ...”\\nCrabbe and Goyle sniggered.\\n“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron\\ntrying to defend himself ... There’s no ’arm in ’im,\\n’onest — ’ . . . that hippogriff’s as good as dead — ”\\nMalfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face\\nsplit in a malevolent grin.\\n“What are you doing, Weasley?”\\nMalfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.\\n“Suppose you’d love to live here, wouldn’t you,\\nWeasley? Dreaming about having your own bedroom?\\nI heard your family all sleep in one room — is that\\ntrue?”\\n \\nHarry seized the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from\\nleaping on Malfoy.\\n“Leave him to me,” he hissed in Ron’s ear.\\nThe opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept\\nsilently around behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,\\nbent down, and scooped a large handful of mud out of\\nthe path.\\n“We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,” Malfoy\\nsaid to Ron. “Just trying to imagine what he’s saying\\nto the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous\\nCreatures. D’you think he’ll cry when they cut off his\\nhippogriff’s — ”\\nSPLAT.\\nMalfoy’s head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his\\nsilver-blond hair was suddenly dripping in muck.\\n“What the — ?”\\nRon had to hold onto the fence to keep himself\\nstanding, he was laughing so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe,\\nand Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly\\naround, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.\\n“What was that? Who did that?”\\n“Very haunted up here, isn’t it?” said Ron, with the\\nair of one commenting on the weather.\\nCrabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging\\nmuscles were no use against ghosts. Malfoy was\\nstaring madly around at the deserted landscape.\\n \\nHarry sneaked along the path, where a particularly\\nsloppy puddle yielded some foul-smelling, green\\nsludge.\\nSPLATTER.\\nCrabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle\\nhopped furiously on the spot, trying to rub it out of\\nhis small, dull eyes.\\n“It came from over there!” said Malfoy, wiping his\\nface, and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of\\nHarry.\\nCrabbe blundered forward, his long arms\\noutstretched like a zombie. Harry dodged around him,\\npicked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe ’s back.\\nHarry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a\\nkind of pirouette in midair, trying to see who had\\nthrown it. As Ron was the only person Crabbe could\\nsee, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry stuck\\nout his leg. Crabbe stumbled — and his huge, flat foot\\ncaught the hem of Harry’s cloak. Harry felt a great\\ntug, then the cloak slid off his face.\\nFor a split second, Malfoy stared at him.\\n“AAARGH!” he yelled, pointing at Harry’s head. Then\\nhe turned tail and ran, at breakneck speed, back\\ndown the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\\nHarry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was\\ndone.\\n“Harry!” Ron said, stumbling forward and staring\\nhopelessly at the point where Harry had disappeared,\\n“you’d better run for it! If Malfoy tells anyone — you’d\\nbetter get back to the castle, quick — ”\\n \\n“See you later,” said Harry, and without another\\nword, he tore back down the path toward Hogsmeade.\\nWould Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would\\nanyone believe Malfoy? Nobody knew about the\\nInvisibility Cloak — nobody except Dumbledore.\\nHarry’s stomach turned over — Dumbledore would\\nknow exactly what had happened, if Malfoy said\\nanything —\\nBack into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps,\\nacross the stone floor, through the trapdoor — Harry\\npulled off the cloak, tucked it under his arm, and ran,\\nflat out, along the passage. ... Malfoy would get back\\nfirst . . . how long would it take him to find a teacher?\\nPanting, a sharp pain in his side, Harry didn’t slow\\ndown until he reached the stone slide. He would have\\nto leave the cloak where it was, it was too much of a\\ngiveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher — he\\nhid it in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast\\nas he could, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of\\nthe chute. He reached the inside of the witch’s hump,\\ntapped it with his wand, stuck his head through, and\\nhoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as\\nHarry jumped out from behind the statue, he heard\\nquick footsteps approaching.\\nIt was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk,\\nhis black robes swishing, then stopped in front of\\nhim.\\n“So,” he said.\\nThere was a look of suppressed triumph about him.\\nHarry tried to look innocent, all too aware of his\\nsweaty face and his muddy hands, which he quickly\\nhid in his pockets.\\n“Come with me, Potter,” said Snape.\\n \\nHarry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his\\nhands clean on the inside of his robes without Snape\\nnoticing. They walked down the stairs to the\\ndungeons and then into Snape’s office.\\nHarry had been in here only once before, and he had\\nbeen in very serious trouble then too. Snape had\\nacquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars\\nsince last time, all standing on shelves behind his\\ndesk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the\\nthreatening atmosphere.\\n“Sit,” said Snape.\\nHarry sat. Snape, however, remained standing.\\n“Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange\\nstory, Potter,” said Snape.\\nHarry didn’t say anything.\\n“He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack\\nwhen he ran into Weasley — apparently alone.”\\nStill, Harry didn’t speak.\\n“Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to\\nWeasley, when a large amount of mud hit him in the\\nback of the head. How do you think that could have\\nhappened?”\\nHarry tried to look mildly surprised.\\n“I don’t know, Professor.”\\nSnape’s eyes were boring into Harry’s. It was exactly\\nlike trying to stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard\\nnot to blink.\\n \\n“Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition.\\nCan you imagine what it might have been, Potter?”\\n“No,” said Harry, now trying to sound innocently\\ncurious.\\n“It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.”\\nThere was a long silence.\\n“Maybe he’d better go to Madam Pomfrey,” said Harry.\\n“If he’s seeing things like — ”\\n“What would your head have been doing in\\nHogsmeade, Potter?” said Snape softly. “Your head is\\nnot allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has\\npermission to be in Hogsmeade.”\\n“I know that,” said Harry, striving to keep his face free\\nof guilt or fear. “It sounds like Malfoy’s having\\nhallucin — ”\\n“Malfoy is not having hallucinations,” snarled Snape,\\nand he bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry’s\\nchair, so that their faces were a foot apart. “If your\\nhead was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.”\\n“I’ve been up in Gryffindor Tower,” said Harry. “Like\\nyou told — ”\\n“Can anyone confirm that?”\\nHarry didn’t say anything. Snape’s thin mouth curled\\ninto a horrible smile.\\n“So,” he said, straightening up again. “Everyone from\\nthe Minister of Magic downward has been trying to\\nkeep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But\\nfamous Harry Potter is a law unto himself. Let the\\n \\nordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry\\nPotter goes where he wants to, with no thought for\\nthe consequences.”\\nHarry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him\\ninto telling the truth. He wasn’t going to do it. Snape\\nhad no proof — yet.\\n“How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,”\\nSnape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. “He too was\\nexceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the\\nQuidditch field made him think he was a cut above\\nthe rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his\\nfriends and admirers . . . The resemblance between you\\nis uncanny.”\\n“My dad didn’t strut,” said Harry, before he could stop\\nhimself. “And neither do I.”\\n“Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,”\\nSnape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face\\nfull of malice. “Rules were for lesser mortals, not\\nQuidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen — ”\\n“SHUT UP!”\\nHarry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had\\nnot felt since his last night in Privet Drive was\\ncoursing through him. He didn’t care that Snape’s\\nface had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing\\ndangerously.\\n“ What did you say to me, Potter?”\\n“I told you to shut up about my dad!” Harry yelled. “I\\nknow the truth, all right? He saved your life!\\nDumbledore told me! You wouldn’t even be here if it\\nwasn’t for my dad!”\\n \\nSnape’s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.\\n“And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances\\nin which your father saved my life?” he whispered.\\n“Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for\\nprecious Potter’s delicate ears?”\\nHarry bit his lip. He didn’t know what had happened\\nand didn’t want to admit it — but Snape seemed to\\nhave guessed the truth.\\n“I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of\\nyour father, Potter,” he said, a terrible grin twisting\\nhis face. “Have you been imagining some act of\\nglorious heroism? Then let me correct you — your\\nsaintly father and his friends played a highly amusing\\njoke on me that would have resulted in my death if\\nyour father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment.\\nThere was nothing brave about what he did. He was\\nsaving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke\\nsucceeded, he would have been expelled from\\nHogwarts.”\\nSnape’s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.\\n“Turn out your pockets, Potter!” he spat suddenly.\\nHarry didn’t move. There was a pounding in his ears.\\n“Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the\\nheadmaster! Pull them out, Potter!”\\nCold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of\\nZonko’s tricks and the Marauder’s Map.\\nSnape picked up the Zonko’s bag.\\n \\n“Ron gave them to me,” said Harry, praying he’d get a\\nchance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him. “He —\\nbrought them back from Hogsmeade last time — ”\\n“Indeed? And you’ve been carrying them around ever\\nsince? How very touching . . . and what is this?”\\nSnape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his\\nmight to keep his face impassive.\\n“Spare bit of parchment,” he said with a shrug.\\nSnape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.\\n“Surely you don’t need such a very old piece of\\nparchment?” he said. “Why don’t I just — throw this\\naway?”\\nHis hand moved toward the fire.\\n“No!” Harry said quickly.\\n“So!” said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. “Is this\\nanother treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it —\\nsomething else? A letter, perhaps, written in invisible\\nink? Or — instructions to get into Hogsmeade without\\npassing the dementors?”\\nHarry blinked. Snape ’s eyes gleamed.\\n“Let me see, let me see ... ,” he muttered, taking out\\nhis wand and smoothing the map out on his desk.\\n“Reveal your secret!” he said, touching the wand to\\nthe parchment.\\nNothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop\\nthem from shaking.\\n \\n“Show yourself!” Snape said, tapping the map\\nsharply.\\nIt stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming\\nbreaths.\\n“Professor Severus Snape, master of this school,\\ncommands you to yield the information you conceal!”\\nSnape said, hitting the map with his wand.\\nAs though an invisible hand were writing upon it,\\nwords appeared on the smooth surface of the map.\\n“Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor\\nSnape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large\\nnose out of other people’s business.”\\nSnape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the\\nmessage. But the map didn’t stop there. More writing\\nwas appearing beneath the first.\\n“Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to\\nadd that Professor Snape is an ugly git.”\\nIt would have been very funny if the situation hadn’t\\nbeen so serious. And there was more. ...\\n“Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment\\nthat an idiot like that ever became a professor.”\\nHarry closed his eyes in horror. When he’d opened\\nthem, the map had had its last word.\\n“Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and\\nadvises him to wash his hair, the slimeball.”\\nHarry waited for the blow to fall.\\n“So ... ,” said Snape softly. “We’ll see about this. ...”\\n \\nHe strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of\\nglittering powder from ajar on the fireplace, and\\nthrew it into the flames.\\n“Lupin!” Snape called into the fire. “I want a word!”\\nUtterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large\\nshape had appeared in it, revolving very fast. Seconds\\nlater, Professor Lupin was clambering out of the\\nfireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.\\n“You called, Severus?” said Lupin mildly.\\n“I certainly did,” said Snape, his face contorted with\\nfury as he strode back to his desk. “I have just asked\\nPotter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this.”\\nSnape pointed at the parchment, on which the words\\nof Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs\\nwere still shining. An odd, closed expression appeared\\non Lupin’s face.\\n“Well?” said Snape.\\nLupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the\\nimpression that Lupin was doing some very quick\\nthinking.\\n“Well?” said Snape again. “This parchment is plainly\\nfull of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be your area of\\nexpertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got\\nsuch a thing?”\\nLupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in\\nHarry’s direction, warned him not to interrupt.\\n“Full of Dark Magic?” he repeated mildly. “Do you\\nreally think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is\\nmerely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who\\n \\nreads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I\\nimagine Harry got it from a joke shop — ”\\n“Indeed?” said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with\\nanger. “You think a joke shop could supply him with\\nsuch a thing? You don’t think it more likely that he\\ngot it directly from the manufacturers?”\\nHarry didn’t understand what Snape was talking\\nabout. Nor, apparently, did Lupin.\\n“You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?”\\nhe said. “Harry, do you know any of these men?”\\n“No,” said Harry quickly.\\n“You see, Severus?” said Lupin, turning back to\\nSnape. “It looks like a Zonko product to me — ”\\nRight on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He\\nwas completely out of breath, and stopped just short\\nof Snape ’s desk, clutching the stitch in his chest and\\ntrying to speak.\\n“I — gave — Harry — that — stuff,” he choked.\\n“Bought — it ... in Zonko ’s ... ages — ago ...”\\n“Well!” said Lupin, clapping his hands together and\\nlooking around cheerfully. “That seems to clear that\\nup! Severus, I’ll take this back, shall I?” He folded the\\nmap and tucked it inside his robes. “Harry, Ron,\\ncome with me, I need a word about my vampire essay\\n— excuse us, Severus — ”\\nHarry didn’t dare look at Snape as they left his office.\\nHe, Ron, and Lupin walked all the way back into the\\nentrance hall before speaking. Then Harry turned to\\nLupin.\\n \\n“Professor, I — ”\\n“I don’t want to hear explanations,” said Lupin\\nshortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall\\nand lowered his voice. “I happen to know that this\\nmap was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago.\\nYes, I know it’s a map,” he said as Harry and Ron\\nlooked amazed. “I don’t want to know how it fell into\\nyour possession. I am, however, astounded that you\\ndidn’t hand it in. Particularly after what happened the\\nlast time a student left information about the castle\\nlying around. And I can’t let you have it back, Harry.”\\nHarry had expected that, and was too keen for\\nexplanations to protest.\\n“Why did Snape think I’d got it from the\\nmanufacturers?”\\n“Because ... ,” Lupin hesitated, “because these\\nmapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of\\nschool. They’d think it extremely entertaining.”\\n“Do you know them?” said Harry, impressed.\\n“We’ve met,” he said shortly. He was looking at Harry\\nmore seriously than ever before.\\n“Don’t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I\\ncannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I\\nwould have thought that what you have heard when\\nthe dementors draw near you would have had more of\\nan effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep\\nyou alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them —\\ngambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.”\\nHe walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far\\nthan he had at any point in Snape ’s office. Slowly, he\\nand Ron mounted the marble staircase. As Harry\\n \\npassed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the\\nInvisibility Cloak — it was still down there, but he\\ndidn’t dare go and get it.\\n“It’s my fault,” said Ron abruptly. “I persuaded you to\\ngo. Lupin’s right, it was stupid, we shouldn’t’ve done\\nit — ”\\nHe broke off; they reached the corridor where the\\nsecurity trolls were pacing, and Hermione was\\nwalking toward them. One look at her face convinced\\nHarry that she had heard what had happened. His\\nheart plummeted — had she told Professor\\nMcGonagall?\\n“Come to have a good gloat?” said Ron savagely as\\nshe stopped in front of them. “Or have you just been\\nto tell on us?”\\n“No,” said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her\\nhands and her lip was trembling. “I just thought you\\nought to know ... Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is\\ngoing to be executed.”\\n \\nTHE QUIDDITCH FINAL\\n“He — he sent me this,” Hermione said, holding out\\nthe letter.\\nHarry took it. The parchment was damp, and\\nenormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in\\nplaces that it was very difficult to read.\\nDear Hermione,\\nWe lost I’m allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts.\\nExecution date to be fixed.\\nBeaky has enjoyed London.\\nI won’t forget all the help you gave us.\\nHagrid\\n“They can’t do this,” said Harry. “They can’t.\\nBuckbeak isn’t dangerous.”\\n \\n“Malfoy’s dad’s frightened the Committee into it,” said\\nHermione, wiping her eyes. “You know what he’s like.\\nThey’re a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were\\nscared. There’ll be an appeal, though, there always is.\\nOnly I can’t see any hope. ... Nothing will have\\nchanged.”\\n“Yeah, it will,” said Ron fiercely. “You won’t have to do\\nall the work alone this time, Hermione. I’ll help.”\\n“Oh, Ron!”\\nHermione flung her arms around Ron’s neck and\\nbroke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified,\\npatted her very awkwardly on the top of the head.\\nFinally, Hermione drew away.\\n“Ron, I’m really, really sorry about Scabbers ... ,” she\\nsobbed.\\n“Oh — well — he was old,” said Ron, looking\\nthoroughly relieved that she had let go of him. “And\\nhe was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad\\nmight get me an owl now.”\\nThe safety measures imposed on the students since\\nBlack’s second break-in made it impossible for Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the\\nevenings. Their only chance of talking to him was\\nduring Care of Magical Creatures lessons.\\nHe seemed numb with shock at the verdict.\\n“S’all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin’\\nthere in black robes an’ I kep’ droppin’ me notes and\\nforgettin’ all them dates yeh looked up fer me,\\nHermione. An’ then Lucius Malfoy stood up an’ said\\nhis bit, and the Committee jus’ did exac’ly what he\\ntold ’em. ...”\\n \\n“There’s still the appeal!” said Ron fiercely. “Don’t give\\nup yet, we’re working on it!”\\nThey were walking back up to the castle with the rest\\nof the class. Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was\\nwalking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking\\nback, laughing derisively.\\n“S’no good, Ron,” said Hagrid sadly as they reached\\nthe castle steps. “That Committee’s in Lucius Malfoy ’s\\npocket. I’m jus’ gonna make sure the rest o’ Beaky’s\\ntime is the happiest he’s ever had. I owe him that. ...”\\nHagrid turned around and hurried back toward his\\ncabin, his face buried in his handkerchief.\\n“Look at him blubber!”\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just\\ninside the castle doors, listening.\\n“Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” said\\nMalfoy. “And he’s supposed to be our teacher!”\\nHarry and Ron both made furious moves toward\\nMalfoy, but Hermione got there first — SMACK!\\nShe had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the\\nstrength she could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry,\\nRon, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as\\nHermione raised her hand again.\\n“Don’t you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you\\nevil — ”\\n“Hermione!” said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her\\nhand as she swung it back.\\n“Get off, Ron!”\\n \\nHermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped\\nbackward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for\\ninstructions, thoroughly bewildered.\\n“C’mon,” Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three\\nof them had disappeared into the passageway to the\\ndungeons.\\n“Hermionel” Ron said again, sounding both stunned\\nand impressed.\\n“Harry, you’d better beat him in the Quidditch final!”\\nHermione said shrilly. “You just better had, because I\\ncan’t stand it if Slytherin wins!”\\n“We’re due in Charms,” said Ron, still goggling at\\nHermione. “We’d better go.”\\nThey hurried up the marble staircase toward\\nProfessor Flitwick’s classroom.\\n“You’re late, boys!” said Professor Flitwick reprovingly\\nas Harry opened the classroom door. “Come along,\\nquickly, wands out, we’re experimenting with\\nCheering Charms today, we’ve already divided into\\npairs — ”\\nHarry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and\\nopened their bags. Ron looked behind him.\\n“Where’s Hermione gone?”\\nHarry looked around too. Hermione hadn’t entered\\nthe classroom, yet Harry knew she had been right\\nnext to him when he had opened the door.\\n“That’s weird,” said Harry, staring at Ron. “Maybe —\\nmaybe she went to the bathroom or something?”\\n \\nBut Hermione didn’t turn up all lesson.\\n“She could’ve done with a Cheering Charm on her\\ntoo,” said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning\\nbroadly — the Cheering Charms had left them with a\\nfeeling of great contentment.\\nHermione wasn’t at lunch either. By the time they\\nhad finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the\\nCheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and\\nRon had started to get slightly worried.\\n“You don’t think Malfoy did something to her?” Ron\\nsaid anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward\\nGryffindor Tower.\\nThey passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the\\npassword (“Flibbertigibbet”), and scrambled through\\nthe portrait hole into the common room.\\nHermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head\\nresting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit\\ndown on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake.\\n“Wh — what?” said Hermione, waking with a start\\nand staring wildly around. “Is it time to go? W —\\nwhich lesson have we got now?\\n“Divination, but it’s not for another twenty minutes,”\\nsaid Harry. “Hermione, why didn’t you come to\\nCharms?”\\n“What? Oh no!” Hermione squeaked. “I forgot to go to\\nCharms!”\\n“But how could you forget?” said Harry. “You were\\nwith us till we were right outside the classroom!”\\n \\n“I don’t believe it!” Hermione wailed. “Was Professor\\nFlitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking\\nabout him and I lost track of things!”\\n“You know what, Hermione?” said Ron, looking down\\nat the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had\\nbeen using as a pillow. “I reckon you’re cracking up.\\nYou’re trying to do too much.”\\n“No, I’m not!” said Hermione, brushing her hair out of\\nher eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. “I\\njust made a mistake, that’s all! I’d better go and see\\nProfessor Flitwick and say sorry. ... I’ll see you in\\nDivination!”\\nHermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to\\nProfessor Trelawney’s classroom twenty minutes later,\\nlooking extremely harassed.\\n“I can’t believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet\\nthey come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted\\nthey might!”\\nTogether they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling\\ntower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal\\nball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione sat down together at the same rickety table.\\n“I thought we weren’t starting crystal balls until next\\nterm,” Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for\\nProfessor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby.\\n“Don’t complain, this means we’ve finished\\npalmistry,” Harry muttered back. “I was getting sick\\nof her flinching every time she looked at my hands.”\\n“Good day to you!” said the familiar, misty voice, and\\nProfessor Trelawney made her usual dramatic\\nentrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender\\n \\nquivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky\\nglow of their crystal ball.\\n“I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little\\nearlier than I had planned,” said Professor Trelawney,\\nsitting with her back to the fire and gazing around.\\n“The fates have informed me that your examination in\\nJune will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give\\nyou sufficient practice.”\\nHermione snorted.\\n“Well, honestly ... ‘the fates have informed her’ ... who\\nsets the exam? She does! What an amazing\\nprediction!” she said, not troubling to keep her voice\\nlow. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.\\nIt was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had\\nheard them, as her face was hidden in shadow. She\\ncontinued, however, as though she had not.\\n“Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,” she said\\ndreamily. “I do not expect any of you to See when first\\nyou peer into the Orb’s infinite depths. We shall start\\nby practicing relaxing the conscious mind and\\nexternal eyes” — Ron began to snigger uncontrollably\\nand had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the\\nnoise — “so as to clear the Inner Eye and the\\nsuperconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you\\nwill See before the end of the class.”\\nAnd so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely\\nfoolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to\\nkeep his mind empty when thoughts such as “this is\\nstupid” kept drifting across it. It didn’t help that Ron\\nkept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept\\ntutting.\\n \\n“Seen anything yet?” Harry asked them after a\\nquarter of an hour’s quiet crystal gazing.\\n“Yeah, there’s a burn on this table,” said Ron,\\npointing. “Someone’s spilled their candle.”\\n“This is such a waste of time,” Hermione hissed. “I\\ncould be practicing something useful. I could be\\ncatching up on Cheering Charms — ”\\nProfessor Trelawney rustled past.\\n“Would anyone like me to help them interpret the\\nshadowy portents within their Orb?” she murmured\\nover the clinking of her bangles.\\n“I don’t need help,” Ron whispered. “It’s obvious what\\nthis means. There’s going to be loads of fog tonight.”\\nBoth Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.\\n“Now, really!” said Professor Trelawney as everyone’s\\nheads turned in their direction. Parvati and Lavender\\nwere looking scandalized. “You are disturbing the\\nclairvoyant vibrations!” She approached their table\\nand peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart\\nsinking. He was sure he knew what was coming —\\n“There is something here!” Professor Trelawney\\nwhispered, lowering her face to the ball, so that it was\\nreflected twice in her huge glasses. “Something\\nmoving . . . but what is it?”\\nHarry was prepared to bet everything he owned,\\nincluding his Firebolt, that it wasn’t good news,\\nwhatever it was. And sure enough —\\n“My dear ... ,” Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing\\nup at Harry. “It is here, plainer than ever before ... my\\n \\ndear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer ... the\\nGr — ”\\n“Oh, for goodness’ sake!” said Hermione loudly. “Not\\nthat ridiculous Grim again\\\\”\\nProfessor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to\\nHermione ’s face. Parvati whispered something to\\nLavender, and they both glared at Hermione too.\\nProfessor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione\\nwith unmistakable anger.\\n“I am sorry to say that from the moment you have\\narrived in this class, my dear, it has been apparent\\nthat you do not have what the noble art of Divination\\nrequires. Indeed, I don’t remember ever meeting a\\nstudent whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.”\\nThere was a moment’s silence. Then —\\n“Fine!” said Hermione suddenly, getting up and\\ncramming Unfogging the Future back into her bag.\\n“Fine!” she repeated, swinging the bag over her\\nshoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. “I\\ngive up! I’m leaving!”\\nAnd to the whole class’s amazement, Hermione strode\\nover to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed\\ndown the ladder out of sight.\\nIt took a few minutes for the class to settle down\\nagain. Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten\\nall about the Grim. She turned abruptly from Harry\\nand Ron’s table, breathing rather heavily as she\\ntugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.\\n“Ooooo!” said Lavender suddenly, making everyone\\nstart. “Oooooo, Professor Trelawney, I’ve just\\nremembered! You saw her leaving, didn’t you? Didn’t\\n \\nyou, Professor? ‘Around Easter, one of our number will\\nleave us forever*.’ You said it ages ago, Professor!”\\nProfessor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile.\\n“Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger\\nwould be leaving us. One hopes, however, that one\\nmight have mistaken the Signs. ... The Inner Eye can\\nbe a burden, you know. ...”\\nLavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and\\nmoved over so that Professor Trelawney could join\\ntheir table instead.\\n“Some day Hermione’s having, eh?” Ron muttered to\\nHarry, looking awed.\\n“Yeah ...”\\nHarry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing\\nbut swirling white mist. Had Professor Trelawney\\nreally seen the Grim again? Would he? The last thing\\nhe needed was another near-fatal accident, with the\\nQuidditch final drawing ever nearer.\\nThe Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The\\nthird years had never had so much homework. Neville\\nLongbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and\\nhe wasn’t the only one.\\n“Call this a holiday!” Seamus Finnigan roared at the\\ncommon room one afternoon. “The exams are ages\\naway, what’re they playing at?”\\nBut nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even\\nwithout Divination, she was taking more subjects\\nthan anybody else. She was usually last to leave the\\ncommon room at night, first to arrive at the library\\n \\nthe next morning; she had shadows like Lupin’s\\nunder her eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears.\\nRon had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak’s\\nappeal. When he wasn’t doing his own work, he was\\nporing over enormously thick volumes with names\\nlike The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl\\nor Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so\\nabsorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to\\nCrookshanks.\\nHarry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around\\nQuidditch practice every day, not to mention endless\\ndiscussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor-\\nSlytherin match would take place on the first\\nSaturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin was\\nleading the tournament by exactly two hundred\\npoints. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his\\nteam) that they needed to win the match by more\\nthan that amount to win the Cup. It also meant that\\nthe burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because\\ncapturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty\\npoints.\\n“So you must catch it only if we’re more than fifty\\npoints up,” Wood told Harry constantly. “Only if we’re\\nmore than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match\\nbut lose the Cup. You’ve got that, haven’t you? You\\nmust catch the Snitch only if we’re — ”\\n“I KNOW, OLIVER!” Harry yelled.\\nThe whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the\\ncoming match. Gryffindor hadn’t won the Quidditch\\nCup since the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron’s\\nsecond oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry\\ndoubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to\\nwin as much as he did. The enmity between Harry\\nand Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was\\n \\nstill smarting about the mud-throwing incident in\\nHogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry\\nhad somehow wormed his way out of punishment.\\nHarry hadn’t forgotten Malfoy’s attempt to sabotage\\nhim in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the\\nmatter of Buckbeak that made him most determined\\nto beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.\\nNever, in anyone’s memory, had a match approached\\nin such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the\\nholidays were over, tension between the two teams\\nand their Houses was at the breaking point. A\\nnumber of small scuffles broke out in the corridors,\\nculminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor\\nfourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the\\nhospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.\\nHarry was having a particularly bad time of it. He\\ncouldn’t walk to class without Slytherins sticking out\\ntheir legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle\\nkept popping up wherever he went, and slouching\\naway looking disappointed when they saw him\\nsurrounded by people. Wood had given instructions\\nthat Harry should be accompanied everywhere he\\nwent, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of\\naction. The whole of Gryffindor House took up the\\nchallenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible\\nfor Harry to get to classes on time because he was\\nsurrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was\\nmore concerned for his Firebolt’s safety than his own.\\nWhen he wasn’t flying it, he locked it securely in his\\ntrunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor\\nTower at break times to check that it was still there.\\nAll usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor\\ncommon room the night before the match. Even\\nHermione had put down her books.\\n“I can’t work, I can’t concentrate,” she said nervously.\\n \\nThere was a great deal of noise. Fred and George\\nWeasley were dealing with the pressure by being\\nlouder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver Wood\\nwas crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the\\ncorner, prodding little figures across it with his wand\\nand muttering to himself. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie\\nwere laughing at Fred’s and George’s jokes. Harry was\\nsitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the\\ncenter of things, trying not to think about the next\\nday, because every time he did, he had the horrible\\nsensation that something very large was fighting to\\nget out of his stomach.\\n“You’re going to be fine,” Hermione told him, though\\nshe looked positively terrified.\\n“You’ve got a Firebolti” said Ron.\\n“Yeah ... ,” said Harry, his stomach writhing.\\nIt came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and\\nyelled, “Team! Bed!”\\nHarry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had\\noverslept, and that Wood was yelling, “Where were\\nyou? We had to use Neville instead!” Then he dreamed\\nthat Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived\\nfor the match riding dragons. He was flying at\\nbreakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames\\nfrom Malfoy ’s steed’s mouth, when he realized he had\\nforgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and\\nwoke with a start.\\nIt was a few seconds before Harry remembered that\\nthe match hadn’t taken place yet, that he was safe in\\nbed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn’t\\nbe allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very\\n \\nthirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-\\nposter and went to pour himself some water from the\\nsilver jug beneath the window.\\nThe grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind\\ndisturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the\\nWhomping Willow was motionless and innocent-\\nlooking. It looked as though the conditions for the\\nmatch would be perfect.\\nHarry set down his goblet and was about to turn back\\nto his bed when something caught his eye. An animal\\nof some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn.\\nHarry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his\\nglasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the\\nwindow. It couldn’t be the Grim — not now — not\\nright before the match —\\nHe peered out at the grounds again and, after a\\nminute’s frantic searching, spotted it. It was skirting\\nthe edge of the forest now. ... It wasn’t the Grim at all\\n...it was a cat. ... Harry clutched the window ledge in\\nrelief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only\\nCrookshanks. ...\\nOr was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted,\\npressing his nose flat against the glass. Crookshanks\\nseemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure he\\ncould see something else moving in the shadow of the\\ntrees too.\\nAnd just then, it emerged — a gigantic, shaggy black\\ndog, moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks\\ntrotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean?\\nIf Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it\\nbe an omen of Harry’s death?\\n“Ron!” Harry hissed. “Ron! Wake up!”\\n \\n“Huh?”\\n“I need you to tell me if you can see something!”\\n“S’all dark, Harry,” Ron muttered thickly. “What’re\\nyou on about?”\\n“Down here — ”\\nHarry looked quickly back out of the window.\\nCrookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry\\nclimbed onto the windowsill to look right down into\\nthe shadows of the castle, but they weren’t there.\\nWhere had they gone?\\nA loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.\\nHarry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the\\nGreat Hall the next day to enormous applause. Harry\\ncouldn’t help grinning broadly as he saw that both\\nthe Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding\\nthem too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they\\npassed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler\\nthan usual.\\nWood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to\\neat, while touching nothing himself. Then he hurried\\nthem off to the field before anyone else had finished,\\nso they could get an idea of the conditions. As they\\nleft the Great Hall, everyone applauded again.\\n“Good luck, Harry!” called Cho. Harry felt himself\\nblushing.\\n“Okay — no wind to speak of — sun’s a bit bright,\\nthat could impair your vision, watch out for it —\\nground’s fairly hard, good, that’ll give us a fast kickoff\\n??\\n \\nWood paced the field, staring around with the team\\nbehind him. Finally, they saw the front doors of the\\ncastle open in the distance and the rest of the school\\nspilling onto the lawn.\\n“Locker rooms,” said Wood tersely.\\nNone of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet\\nrobes. Harry wondered if they were feeling like he\\nwas: as though he’d eaten something extremely\\nwriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at\\nall, Wood was saying, “Okay, it’s time, let’s go — ”\\nThey walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise.\\nThree-quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet\\nrosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion\\nupon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like\\n“GO GRYFFINDOR!” and “LIONS FOR THE CUP!”\\nBehind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two\\nhundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent\\nof Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor\\nSnape sat in the very front row, wearing green like\\neveryone else, and a very grim smile.\\n“And here are the Gryffindors!” yelled Lee Jordan,\\nwho was acting as commentator as usual. “Potter,\\nBell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood.\\nWidely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has\\nseen in a good few years — ”\\nLee’s comments were drowned by a tide of “boos” from\\nthe Slytherin end.\\n“And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain\\nFlint. He’s made some changes in the lineup and\\nseems to be going for size rather than skill — ”\\nMore boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however,\\nthought Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily the\\n \\nsmallest person on the Slytherin team; the rest of\\nthem were enormous.\\n“Captains, shake hands!” said Madam Hooch.\\nFlint and Wood approached each other and grasped\\neach other’s hand very tightly; it looked as though\\neach was trying to break the other’s fingers.\\n“Mount your brooms!” said Madam Hooch. “Three ...\\ntwo ... one ...”\\nThe sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the\\ncrowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Harry felt\\nhis hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him\\nin the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw\\nMalfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the\\nSnitch.\\n“And it’s Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of\\nGryffindor with the Quaffle, heading straight for the\\nSlytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no —\\nQuaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington of\\nSlytherin tearing up the field — WHAM! — nice\\nBludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington\\ndrops the Quaffle, it’s caught by — Johnson,\\nGryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina —\\nnice swerve around Montague — duck, Angelina,\\nthat’s a Bludger] — SHE SCORES! TEN-ZERO TO\\nGRYFFINDOR!”\\nAngelina punched the air as she soared around the\\nend of the field; the sea of scarlet below was\\nscreaming its delight —\\n“OUCH!”\\nAngelina was nearly thrown from her broom as\\nMarcus Flint went smashing into her.\\n \\n“Sorry!” said Flint as the crowd below booed. “Sorry,\\ndidn’t see her!”\\nA moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater’s\\nclub at the back of Flint’s head. Flint’s nose smashed\\ninto the handle of his broom and began to bleed.\\n“That will do!” shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming\\nbetween them. “Penalty shot to Gryffindor for an\\nunprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty shot to\\nSlytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!”\\n“Come off it, Miss!” howled Fred, but Madam Hooch\\nblew her whistle and Alicia flew forward to take the\\npenalty.\\n“Come on, Alicia!” yelled Lee into the silence that had\\ndescended on the crowd. “YES! SHE’S BEATEN THE\\nKEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!”\\nHarry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still\\nbleeding freely, fly forward to take the Slytherin\\npenalty. Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor\\ngoal posts, his jaw clenched.\\n“ ’Course, Wood’s a superb Keeper!” Lee Jordan told\\nthe crowd as Flint waited for Madam Hooch’s whistle.\\n“Superb! Very difficult to pass — very difficult indeed\\n— YES! I DONT BELIEVE IT! HE’S SAVED IT!”\\nRelieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the\\nSnitch, but still making sure he caught every word of\\nLee’s commentary. It was essential that he hold\\nMalfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than\\nfifty points up —\\n“Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession\\n— no! — Gryffindor back in possession and it’s Katie\\n \\nBell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she’s\\nstreaking up the field — THAT WAS DELIBERATE!”\\nMontague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of\\nKatie, and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed\\nher head. Katie cartwheeled in the air, managed to\\nstay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle.\\nMadam Hooch’s whistle rang out again as she soared\\nover to Montague and began shouting at him. A\\nminute later, Katie had put another penalty past the\\nSlytherin Seeker.\\n“THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING\\n“Jordan, if you can’t commentate in an unbiased way\\n— !”\\n“I’m telling it like it is, Professor!”\\nHarry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the\\nSnitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the\\nGryffindor goal posts — but he mustn’t catch it yet —\\nand if Malfoy saw it —\\nFaking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled\\nhis Firebolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin\\nend — it worked. Malfoy went haring after him,\\nclearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there. ...\\nWHOOSH.\\nOne of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry’s right\\near, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick.\\nThen again —\\nWHOOSH.\\n \\nThe second Bludger grazed Harry’s elbow. The other\\nBeater, Bole, was closing in.\\nHarry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick\\nzooming toward him, clubs raised —\\nHe turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and\\nBole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch.\\n“Ha haaa!” yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters\\nlurched away from each other, clutching their heads.\\n“Too bad, boys! You’ll need to get up earlier than that\\nto beat a Firebolt! And it’s Gryffindor in possession\\nagain, as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside\\nher — poke him in the eye, Angelina! — it was a joke,\\nProfessor, it was a joke — oh no — Flint in\\npossession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal\\nposts, come on now, Wood, save — !”\\nBut Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers\\nfrom the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that\\nProfessor McGonagall tried to tug the magical\\nmegaphone away from him.\\n“Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won’t happen again! So,\\nGryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and\\nGryffindor in possession — ”\\nIt was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever\\nplayed in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an\\nearly lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any\\nmeans to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his\\nclub and tried to say he’d thought she was a Bludger.\\nGeorge Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in\\nretaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams\\npenalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular\\nsave, making the score forty-ten to Gryffindor.\\n \\nThe Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still\\nkeeping close to Harry as he soared over the match,\\nlooking around for it — once Gryffindor was fifty\\npoints ahead —\\nKatie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were\\nswooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the\\nSlytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick\\ntook advantage of Fred’s and George’s absence to aim\\nboth Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the\\nstomach, one after the other, and he rolled over in the\\nair, clutching his broom, completely winded.\\nMadam Hooch was beside herself.\\n“YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE\\nQUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING AREA!” she\\nshrieked at Bole and Derrick. “Gryffindor penalty!”\\nAnd Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred\\nWeasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the\\nQuaffle out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it\\nthrough the Slytherin goal — seventy-ten.\\nThe Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself\\nhoarse — Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead, and\\nif Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs.\\nHarry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following\\nhim as he soared around the field, high above the rest\\nof the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him.\\nAnd then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty\\nfeet above him.\\nHarry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was\\nroaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but\\nsuddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down —\\n \\nHorrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown\\nhimself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt’s tail,\\nand was pulling it back.\\n“You — ”\\nHarry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn’t\\nreach — Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding\\nonto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling\\nmaliciously. He had achieved what he’d wanted to do\\n— the Snitch had disappeared again.\\n“Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I’ve never seen such\\ntactics!” Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to\\nwhere Malfoy was sliding back onto his Nimbus Two\\nThousand and One.\\n“YOU CHEATING SCUM!” Lee Jordan was howling\\ninto the megaphone, dancing out of Professor\\nMcGonagall’s reach. “YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B — ”\\nProfessor McGonagall didn’t even bother to tell him\\noff. She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoy’s\\ndirection, her hat had fallen off, and she too was\\nshouting furiously.\\nAlicia took Gryffindor’s penalty, but she was so angry\\nshe missed by several feet. The Gryffindor team was\\nlosing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by\\nMalfoy’s foul on Harry, were being spurred on to\\ngreater heights.\\n“Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal —\\nMontague scores — ” Lee groaned. “Seventy-twenty to\\nGryffindor. ...”\\nHarry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees\\nkept hitting each other. Harry wasn’t going to let\\nMalfoy anywhere near the Snitch. ...\\n \\n“Get out of it, Potter!” Malfoy yelled in frustration as\\nhe tried to turn and found Harry blocking him.\\n“Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor,\\ncome on, Angelina, COME ON!”\\nHarry looked around. Every single Slytherin player\\napart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward\\nAngelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were\\nall going to block her —\\nHarry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he\\nwas lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward.\\nLike a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins.\\n“AAAAAAARRRGH ! ”\\nThey scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them;\\nAngelina’s way was clear.\\n“SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by\\neighty points to twenty!”\\nHarry, who had almost pelted headlong into the\\nstands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and\\nzoomed back into the middle of the field.\\nAnd then he saw something to make his heart stand\\nstill. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face\\n— there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny,\\ngolden glimmer —\\nHarry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was\\nmiles ahead —\\n“Go! Go! Go!” Harry urged his broom. He was gaining\\non Malfoy — Harry flattened himself to the broom\\nhandle as Bole sent a Bludger at him — he was at\\nMalfoy’s ankles — he was level —\\n \\nHarry threw himself forward, took both hands off his\\nbroom. He knocked Malfoy’s arm out of the way and\\n“YES!”\\nHe pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the\\nstadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an\\nodd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held\\ntight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against\\nhis fingers.\\nThen Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by\\ntears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed\\nunrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large\\nthumps as Fred and George hit them; then\\nAngelina’s, Alicia’s, and Katie’s voices, “We’ve won the\\nCup\\\\ We’ve won the Cup\\\\” Tangled together in a\\nmany-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling\\nhoarsely, back to earth.\\nWave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring\\nover the barriers onto the field. Hands were raining\\ndown on their backs. Harry had a confused\\nimpression of noise and bodies pressing in on him.\\nThen he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto\\nthe shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into the light, he\\nsaw Hagrid, plastered with crimson rosettes — “Yeh\\nbeat ’em, Harry, yeh beat ’em! Wait till I tell\\nBuckbeak!” There was Percy, jumping up and down\\nlike a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor\\nMcGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood,\\nwiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag;\\nand there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron\\nand Hermione. Words failed them. They simply\\nbeamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where\\nDumbledore stood waiting with the enormous\\nQuidditch Cup.\\n \\nIf only there had been a dementor around. ... As a\\nsobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it\\ninto the air, Harry felt he could have produced the\\nworld’s best Patronus.\\n \\nPROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S\\nPREDICTION\\nHarry’s euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup\\nlasted at least a week. Even the weather seemed to be\\ncelebrating; as June approached, the days became\\ncloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing\\nwas strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on\\nthe grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice,\\nperhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or\\nwatching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across\\nthe surface of the lake.\\nBut they couldn’t. Exams were nearly upon them, and\\ninstead of lazing around outside, the students were\\nforced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their\\nbrains into concentrating while enticing wafts of\\nsummer air drifted in through the windows. Even\\nFred and George Weasley had been spotted working;\\nthey were about to take their O.W.L.s (Ordinary\\nWizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his\\nN.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the\\nhighest qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy\\n \\nhoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top\\ngrades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave\\nvery severe punishments to anybody who disturbed\\nthe quiet of the common room in the evenings. In fact,\\nthe only person who seemed more anxious than Percy\\nwas Hermione.\\nHarry and Ron had given up asking her how she was\\nmanaging to attend several classes at once, but they\\ncouldn’t restrain themselves when they saw the exam\\nschedule she had drawn up for herself. The first\\ncolumn read:\\nMonday\\n9 o’clock, Arithmancy\\n9 o’clock, Transfiguration\\nLunch\\n1 o’clock, Charms\\n1 o’clock, Ancient Runes\\n“Hermione?” Ron said cautiously, because she was\\nliable to explode when interrupted these days. “Er —\\nare you sure you’ve copied down these times right?”\\n“What?” snapped Hermione, picking up the exam\\nschedule and examining it. “Yes, of course I have.”\\n“Is there any point asking how you’re going to sit for\\ntwo exams at once?” said Harry.\\n“No,” said Hermione shortly. “Have either of you seen\\nmy copy of Numerology and Gramatica?”\\n \\n“Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,”\\nsaid Ron, but very quietly. Hermione started shifting\\nheaps of parchment around on her table, looking for\\nthe book. Just then, there was a rustle at the window\\nand Hedwig fluttered through it, a note clutched tight\\nin her beak.\\n“It’s from Hagrid,” said Harry, ripping the note open.\\n“Buckbeak’s appeal — it’s set for the sixth.”\\n“That’s the day we finish our exams,” said Hermione,\\nstill looking everywhere for her Arithmancy book.\\n“And they’re coming up here to do it,” said Harry, still\\nreading from the letter. “Someone from the Ministry of\\nMagic and — and an executioner.”\\nHermione looked up, startled.\\n“They’re bringing the executioner to the appeal! But\\nthat sounds as though they’ve already decided!”\\n“Yeah, it does,” said Harry slowly.\\n“They can’t!” Ron howled. “I’ve spent ages reading up\\non stuff for him; they can’t just ignore it all!”\\nBut Harry had a horrible feeling that the Committee\\nfor the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had had its\\nmind made up for it by Mr. Malfoy. Draco, who had\\nbeen noticeably subdued since Gryffindor’s triumph\\nin the Quidditch final, seemed to regain some of his\\nold swagger over the next few days. From sneering\\ncomments Harry overheard, Malfoy was certain\\nBuckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed\\nthoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about.\\nIt was all Harry could do to stop himself imitating\\nHermione and hitting Malfoy in the face on these\\noccasions. And the worst thing of all was that they\\n \\nhad no time or opportunity to go and see Hagrid,\\nbecause the strict new security measures had not\\nbeen lifted, and Harry didn’t dare retrieve his\\nInvisibility Cloak from below the one-eyed witch.\\nk k k\\nExam week began and an unnatural hush fell over\\nthe castle. The third years emerged from\\nTransfiguration at lunchtime on Monday, limp and\\nashen-faced, comparing results and bemoaning the\\ndifficulty of the tasks they had been set, which had\\nincluded turning a teapot into a tortoise. Hermione\\nirritated the rest by fussing about how her tortoise\\nhad looked more like a turtle, which was the least of\\neveryone else’s worries.\\n“Mine still had a spout for a tail, what a nightmare.\\n“Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam?”\\n“It still had a willow-patterned shell, d’you think\\nthat 11 count against me?”\\nThen, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back\\nupstairs for the Charms exam. Hermione had been\\nright; Professor Flitwick did indeed test them on\\nCheering Charms. Harry slightly overdid his out of\\nnerves and Ron, who was partnering him, ended up\\nin fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to\\na quiet room for an hour before he was ready to\\nperform the charm himself. After dinner, the students\\nhurried back to their common rooms, not to relax,\\nbut to start studying for Care of Magical Creatures,\\nPotions, and Astronomy.\\n \\nHagrid presided over the Care of Magical Creatures\\nexam the following morning with a very preoccupied\\nair indeed; his heart didn’t seem to be in it at all. He\\nhad provided a large tub of fresh flobberworms for the\\nclass, and told them that to pass the test, their\\nflobberworm had to still be alive at the end of one\\nhour. As flobberworms flourished best if left to their\\nown devices, it was the easiest exam any of them had\\never taken, and also gave Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\nplenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid.\\n“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” Hagrid told them,\\nbending low on the pretense of checking that Harry’s\\nflobberworm was still alive. “Bin cooped up too long.\\nBut still ... we’ll know day after tomorrow — one way\\nor the other — ”\\nThey had Potions that afternoon, which was an\\nunqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he couldn’t\\nget his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape,\\nstanding watch with an air of vindictive pleasure,\\nscribbled something that looked suspiciously like a\\nzero onto his notes before moving away.\\nThen came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest\\ntower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in\\nwhich Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue\\nhad ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while\\nwishing he could have had one of Fortescue ’s choco-\\nnut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom.\\nWednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the\\ngreenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to\\nthe common room once more, with sunburnt necks,\\nthinking longingly of this time next day, when it\\nwould all be over.\\nTheir second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had\\ncompiled the most unusual exam any of them had\\n \\never taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the\\nsun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling\\npool containing a grindylow, cross a series of potholes\\nfull of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of\\nmarsh while ignoring misleading directions from a\\nhinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle\\nwith a new boggart.\\n“Excellent, Harry,” Lupin muttered as Harry climbed\\nout of the trunk, grinning. “Full marks.”\\nFlushed with his success, Harry hung around to\\nwatch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well until he\\nreached the hinkypunk, which successfully confused\\nhim into sinking waist-high into the quagmire.\\nHermione did everything perfectly until she reached\\nthe trunk with the boggart in it. After about a minute\\ninside it, she burst out again, screaming.\\n“Hermione!” said Lupin, startled. “What’s the matter?”\\n“P — P — Professor McGonagall!” Hermione gasped,\\npointing into the trunk. “Sh — she said I’d failed\\neverything!”\\nIt took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at\\nlast she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry,\\nand Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly\\ninclined to laugh at Hermione ’s boggart, but an\\nargument was averted by the sight that met them on\\nthe top of the steps.\\nCornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped\\ncloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds.\\nHe started at the sight of Harry.\\n“Hello there, Harry!” he said. “Just had an exam, I\\nexpect? Nearly finished?”\\n \\n“Yes,” said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on\\nspeaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered\\nawkwardly in the background.\\n“Lovely day,” said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake.\\n“Pity ... pity ...”\\nHe sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.\\n“I’m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The\\nCommittee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures\\nrequired a witness to the execution of a mad\\nhippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on\\nthe Black situation, I was asked to step in.”\\n“Does that mean the appeal’s already happened?” Ron\\ninterrupted, stepping forward.\\n“No, no, it’s scheduled for this afternoon,” said Fudge,\\nlooking curiously at Ron.\\n“Then you might not have to witness an execution at\\nall!” said Ron stoutly. “The hippogriff might get off!”\\nBefore Fudge could answer, two wizards came\\nthrough the castle doors behind him. One was so\\nancient he appeared to be withering before their very\\neyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin\\nblack mustache. Harry gathered that they were\\nrepresentatives of the Committee for the Disposal of\\nDangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard\\nsquinted toward Hagrid’s cabin and said in a feeble\\nvoice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this. ... Two\\no’clock, isn’t it, Fudge?”\\nThe black-mustached man was fingering something in\\nhis belt; Harry looked and saw that he was running\\none broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe.\\nRon opened his mouth to say something, but\\n \\nHermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her\\nhead toward the entrance hall.\\n“Why’d you stop me?” said Ron angrily as they\\nentered the Great Hall for lunch. “Did you see them?\\nThey’ve even got the axe ready! This isn’t justice!”\\n“Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can’t go\\nsaying things like that to his boss!” said Hermione,\\nbut she too looked very upset. “As long as Hagrid\\nkeeps his head this time, and argues his case\\nproperly, they can’t possibly execute Buckbeak. ...”\\nBut Harry could tell Hermione didn’t really believe\\nwhat she was saying. All around them, people were\\ntalking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily\\nanticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid\\nand Buckbeak, didn’t join in.\\nHarry’s and Ron’s last exam was Divination;\\nHermione’s, Muggle Studies. They walked up the\\nmarble staircase together; Hermione left them on the\\nfirst floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way\\nup to the seventh, where many of their class were\\nsitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney’s\\nclassroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute\\nstudying.\\n“She’s seeing us all separately,” Neville informed them\\nas they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy\\nof Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages\\ndevoted to crystal gazing. “Have either of you ever\\nseen anything in a crystal ball?” he asked them\\nunhappily.\\n“Nope,” said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept\\nchecking his watch; Harry knew that he was counting\\ndown the time until Buckbeak’s appeal started.\\n \\nThe line of people outside the classroom shortened\\nvery slowly. As each person climbed back down the\\nsilver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, “What did\\nshe ask? Was it okay?”\\nBut they all refused to say.\\n“She says the crystal ball’s told her that if I tell you,\\nI’ll have a horrible accident!” squeaked Neville as he\\nclambered back down the ladder toward Harry and\\nRon, who had now reached the landing.\\n“That’s convenient,” snorted Ron. “You know, I’m\\nstarting to think Hermione was right about her” — he\\njabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead —\\n“she’s a right old fraud.”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, looking at his own watch. It was\\nnow two o’clock. “Wish she’d hurry up ...”\\nParvati came back down the ladder glowing with\\npride.\\n“She says I’ve got all the makings of a true Seer,” she\\ninformed Harry and Ron. “I saw loads of stuff. ... Well,\\ngood luck!”\\nShe hurried off down the spiral staircase toward\\nLavender.\\n“Ronald Weasley,” said the familiar, misty voice from\\nover their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed\\nthe silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only\\nperson left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor\\nwith his back against the wall, listening to a fly\\nbuzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the\\ngrounds with Hagrid.\\n \\nFinally, after about twenty minutes, Ron’s large feet\\nreappeared on the ladder.\\n“How’d it go?” Harry asked him, standing up.\\n“Rubbish,” said Ron. “Couldn’t see a thing, so I made\\nsome stuff up. Don’t think she was convinced,\\nthough. ...”\\n“Meet you in the common room,” Harry muttered as\\nProfessor Trelawney’s voice called, “Harry Potter!”\\nThe tower room was hotter than ever before; the\\ncurtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the\\nusual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled\\nthrough the clutter of chairs and tables to where\\nProfessor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large\\ncrystal ball.\\n“Good day, my dear,” she said softly. “If you would\\nkindly gaze into the Orb. ... Take your time, now ...\\nthen tell me what you see within it. ...”\\nHarry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as\\nhard as he could, willing it to show him something\\nother than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.\\n“Well?” Professor Trelawney prompted delicately.\\n“What do you see?”\\nThe heat was overpowering and his nostrils were\\nstinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the\\nfire beside them. He thought of what Ron had just\\nsaid, and decided to pretend.\\n“Er — ” said Harry, “a dark shape ... um ...”\\n“What does it resemble?” whispered Professor\\nTrelawney. “Think, now ...”\\n \\nHarry cast his mind around and it landed on\\nBuckbeak.\\n“A hippogriff,” he said firmly.\\n“Indeed!” whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling\\nkeenly on the parchment perched upon her knees.\\n“My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor\\nHagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look\\ncloser. . . . Does the hippogriff appear to . . . have its\\nhead?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry firmly.\\n“Are you sure?” Professor Trelawney urged him. “Are\\nyou quite sure, dear? You don’t see it writhing on the\\nground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe\\nbehind it?”\\n“No!” said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.\\n“No blood? No weeping Hagrid?”\\n“No!” said Harry again, wanting more than ever to\\nleave the room and the heat. “It looks fine, it’s —\\nflying away. ...”\\nProfessor Trelawney sighed.\\n“Well, dear, I think we’ll leave it there. ... A little\\ndisappointing ... but I’m sure you did your best.”\\nRelieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned\\nto go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.\\n“It will happen tonight.”\\n \\nHarry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone\\nrigid in her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and\\nher mouth sagging.\\n“S — sorry?” said Harry.\\nBut Professor Trelawney didn’t seem to hear him. Her\\neyes started to roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She\\nlooked as though she was about to have some sort of\\nseizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the\\nhospital wing — and then Professor Trelawney spoke\\nagain, in the same harsh voice, quite unlike her own:\\n“The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned\\nby his followers. His servant has been chained these\\ntwelve years. Tonight, before midnight ... the servant\\nwill break free and set out to rejoin his master. The\\nDark Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid,\\ngreater and more terrible than ever he was. Tonight ...\\nbefore midnight . . . the servant . . . will set out ... to\\nrejoin ... his master. ...”\\nProfessor Trelawney’s head fell forward onto her\\nchest. She made a grunting sort of noise. Harry sat\\nthere, staring at her. Then, quite suddenly, Professor\\nTrelawney’s head snapped up again.\\n“I’m so sorry, dear boy,” she said dreamily, “the heat\\nof the day, you know ... I drifted off for a moment. ...”\\nHarry sat there, staring at her.\\n“Is there anything wrong, my dear?”\\n“You — you just told me that the — the Dark Lord’s\\ngoing to rise again ... that his servant’s going to go\\nback to him. ...”\\nProfessor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.\\n \\n“The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My\\ndear boy, that’s hardly something to joke about. ...\\nRise again, indeed — ”\\n“But you just said it! You said the Dark Lord — ”\\n“I think you must have dozed off too, dear!” said\\nProfessor Trelawney. “I would certainly not presume\\nto predict anything quite as far-fetched as that\\\\”\\nHarry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral\\nstaircase, wondering ... had he just heard Professor\\nTrelawney make a real prediction? Or had that been\\nher idea of an impressive end to the test?\\nFive minutes later he was dashing past the security\\ntrolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower,\\nProfessor Trelawney’s words still resounding in his\\nhead. People were striding past him in the opposite\\ndirection, laughing and joking, heading for the\\ngrounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom; by the\\ntime he had reached the portrait hole and entered the\\ncommon room, it was almost deserted. Over in the\\ncorner, however, sat Ron and Hermione.\\n“Professor Trelawney,” Harry panted, “just told me — ”\\nBut he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces.\\n“Buckbeak lost,” said Ron weakly. “Hagrid’s just sent\\nthis.”\\nHagrid’s note was dry this time, no tears had\\nsplattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so\\nmuch as he wrote that it was hardly legible.\\nLost appeal. They’re going to execute at sunset\\nNothing you can do. Don’t come down.\\n \\nI don’t want you to see it\\nHagrid\\n“We’ve got to go,” said Harry at once. “He can’t just sit\\nthere on his own, waiting for the executioner!”\\n“Sunset, though,” said Ron, who was staring out the\\nwindow in a glazed sort of way. “We’d never be\\nallowed ... ’specially you, Harry. ...”\\nHarry sank his head into his hands, thinking.\\n“If we only had the Invisibility Cloak. ...”\\n“Where is it?” said Hermione.\\nHarry told her about leaving it in the passageway\\nunder the one-eyed witch.\\n\"... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I’m\\nin serious trouble,” he finished.\\n“That’s true,” said Hermione, getting to her feet. “If he\\nsees you. ... How do you open the witch’s hump\\nagain?”\\n“You — you tap it and say, ‘Dissendium,’ ” said Harry.\\n“But — ”\\nHermione didn’t wait for the rest of his sentence; she\\nstrode across the room, pushed open the Fat Lady’s\\nportrait and vanished from sight.\\n“She hasn’t gone to get it?” Ron said, staring after\\nher.\\n \\nShe had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour\\nlater with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her\\nrobes.\\n“Hermione, I don’t know what’s gotten into you\\nlately!” said Ron, astounded. “First you hit Malfoy,\\nthen you walk out on Professor Trelawney — ”\\nHermione looked rather flattered.\\nThey went down to dinner with everybody else, but\\ndid not return to Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry\\nhad the cloak hidden down the front of his robes; he\\nhad to keep his arms folded to hide the lump. They\\nskulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall,\\nlistening, until they were sure it was deserted. They\\nheard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall\\nand a door slamming. Hermione poked her head\\naround the door.\\n“Okay,” she whispered, “no one there — cloak on — ”\\nWalking very close together so that nobody would see\\nthem, they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the\\ncloak, then walked down the stone front steps into\\nthe grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the\\nForbidden Forest, gilding the top branches of the\\ntrees.\\nThey reached Hagrid’s cabin and knocked. He was a\\nminute in answering, and when he did, he looked all\\naround for his visitor, pale-faced and trembling.\\n“It’s us,” Harry hissed. “We’re wearing the Invisibility\\nCloak. Let us in and we can take it off.”\\n“Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered, but he\\nstood back, and they stepped inside. Hagrid shut the\\ndoor quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak.\\n \\nHagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon\\ntheir necks. He looked like a man who did not know\\nwhere he was or what to do. This helplessness was\\nworse to watch than tears.\\n“Wan’ some tea?” he said. His great hands were\\nshaking as he reached for the kettle.\\n“Where’s Buckbeak, Hagrid?” said Hermione\\nhesitantly.\\n“I — I took him outside,” said Hagrid, spilling milk all\\nover the table as he filled up the jug. “He’s tethered in\\nme pumpkin patch. Thought he oughta see the trees\\nan’ — an’ smell fresh air — before — ”\\nHagrid ’s hand trembled so violently that the milk jug\\nslipped from his grasp and shattered all over the\\nfloor.\\n“I’ll do it, Hagrid,” said Hermione quickly, hurrying\\nover and starting to clean up the mess.\\n“There’s another one in the cupboard,” Hagrid said,\\nsitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve.\\nHarry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly.\\n“Isn’t there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?” Harry\\nasked fiercely, sitting down next to him. “Dumbledore\\n“He’s tried,” said Hagrid. “He’s got no power ter\\noverrule the Committee. He told ’em Buckbeak’s all\\nright, but they’re scared. ... Yeh know what Lucius\\nMalfoy’s like ... threatened ’em, I expect ... an’ the\\nexecutioner, Macnair, he’s an old pal o’ Malfoy’s ...\\nbut it’ll be quick an’ clean ... an’ I’ll be beside him. ...”\\n \\nHagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the\\ncabin as though looking for some shred of hope or\\ncomfort.\\n“Dumbledore ’s gonna come down while it — while it\\nhappens. Wrote me this mornin’. Said he wants ter —\\nter be with me. Great man, Dumbledore. ...”\\nHermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid ’s\\ncupboard for another milk jug, let out a small, quickly\\nstifled sob. She straightened up with the new jug in\\nher hands, fighting back tears.\\n“Well stay with you too, Hagrid,” she began, but\\nHagrid shook his shaggy head.\\n“Yeh’re ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don’\\nwan’ yeh watchin’. An’ yeh shouldn’ be down here\\nanyway. ... If Fudge an’ Dumbledore catch yeh out\\nwithout permission, Harry, yehll be in big trouble.”\\nSilent tears were now streaming down Hermione ’s\\nface, but she hid them from Hagrid, bustling around\\nmaking tea. Then, as she picked up the milk bottle to\\npour some into the jug, she let out a shriek.\\n“Ron! I — I don’t believe it — it’s Scabbersl”\\nRon gaped at her.\\n“What are you talking about?”\\nHermione carried the milk jug over to the table and\\nturned it upside down. With a frantic squeak, and\\nmuch scrambling to get back inside, Scabbers the rat\\ncame sliding out onto the table.\\n“Scabbers!” said Ron blankly. “Scabbers, what are\\nyou doing here?”\\n \\nHe grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the\\nlight. Scabbers looked dreadful. He was thinner than\\never, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide\\nbald patches, and he writhed in Ron’s hands as\\nthough desperate to free himself.\\n“It’s okay, Scabbers!” said Ron. “No cats! There’s\\nnothing here to hurt you!”\\nHagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the\\nwindow. His normally ruddy face had gone the color\\nof parchment.\\n“They’re cornin’. ...”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group\\nof men was walking down the distant castle steps. In\\nfront was Albus Dumbledore, his silver beard\\ngleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted\\nCornelius Fudge. Behind them came the feeble old\\nCommittee member and the executioner, Macnair.\\n“Yeh gotta go,” said Hagrid. Every inch of him was\\ntrembling. “They mustn’ find yeh here. ... Go now. ...”\\nRon stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione\\npicked up the cloak.\\n“I’ll let yeh out the back way,” said Hagrid.\\nThey followed him to the door into his back garden.\\nHarry felt strangely unreal, and even more so when\\nhe saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree\\nbehind Hagrid’s pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to\\nknow something was happening. He turned his sharp\\nhead from side to side and pawed the ground\\nnervously.\\n \\n“It’s okay, Beaky,” said Hagrid softly. “It’s okay ...” He\\nturned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “Go on,” he\\nsaid. “Get goin’.”\\nBut they didn’t move.\\n“Hagrid, we can’t — ”\\n“Well tell them what really happened — ”\\n“They can’t kill him — ”\\n“Go!” said Hagrid fiercely. “It’s bad enough without\\nyou lot in trouble an’ all!”\\nThey had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak\\nover Harry and Ron, they heard voices at the front of\\nthe cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where they had\\njust vanished from sight.\\n“Go quick,” he said hoarsely. “Don’ listen. ...”\\nAnd he strode back into his cabin as someone\\nknocked at the front door.\\nSlowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione set off silently around Hagrid’s house. As\\nthey reached the other side, the front door closed with\\na sharp snap.\\n“Please, let’s hurry,” Hermione whispered. “I can’t\\nstand it, I can’t bear it. ...”\\nThey started up the sloping lawn toward the castle.\\nThe sun was sinking fast now; the sky had turned to\\na clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the west there was\\na ruby-red glow.\\nRon stopped dead.\\n \\n“Oh, please, Ron,” Hermione began.\\n“It’s Scabbers — he won’t — stay put — ”\\nRon was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his\\npocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking\\nmadly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink his teeth\\ninto Ron’s hand.\\n“Scabbers, it’s me, you idiot, it’s Ron,” Ron hissed.\\nThey heard a door open behind them and men’s\\nvoices.\\n“Oh, Ron, please let’s move, they’re going to do it!”\\nHermione breathed.\\n“Okay — Scabbers, stay put — ”\\nThey walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was\\ntrying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind\\nthem. Ron stopped again.\\n“I can’t hold him — Scabbers, shut up, everyone’ll\\nhear us — ”\\nThe rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough\\nto cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid’s garden.\\nThere was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a\\nsilence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable\\nswish and thud of an axe.\\nHermione swayed on the spot.\\n“They did it!” she whispered to Harry. “I d — don’t\\nbelieve it — they did it!”\\n \\nCAT, RAT, AND DOG\\nHarry’s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of\\nthem stood transfixed with horror under the\\nInvisibility Cloak. The very last rays of the setting sun\\nwere casting a bloody light over the long-shadowed\\ngrounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild\\nhowling.\\n“Hagrid,” Harry muttered. Without thinking about\\nwhat he was doing, he made to turn back, but both\\nRon and Hermione seized his arms.\\n“We can’t,” said Ron, who was paper-white. “He’ll be\\nin worse trouble if they know we’ve been to see him.\\nHermione ’s breathing was shallow and uneven.\\n“How — could — they?” she choked. “How could\\nthey?”\\n“Come on,” said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be\\nchattering.\\n \\nThey set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to\\nkeep themselves hidden under the cloak. The light\\nwas fading fast now. By the time they reached open\\nground, darkness was settling like a spell around\\nthem.\\n“Scabbers, keep still,” Ron hissed, clamping his hand\\nover his chest. The rat was wriggling madly. Ron\\ncame to a sudden halt, trying to force Scabbers\\ndeeper into his pocket. “What’s the matter with you,\\nyou stupid rat? Stay still — OUCH! He bit me!”\\n“Ron, be quiet!” Hermione whispered urgently.\\n“Fudge’ll be out here in a minute — ”\\n“He won’t — stay — put — ”\\nScabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with\\nall his might, trying to break free of Ron’s grip.\\n“What’s the matter with him?”\\nBut Harry had just seen — slinking toward them, his\\nbody low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting\\neerily in the darkness — Crookshanks. Whether he\\ncould see them or was following the sound of\\nScabbers’s squeaks, Harry couldn’t tell.\\n“Crookshanks!” Hermione moaned. “No, go away,\\nCrookshanks! Go away!”\\nBut the cat was getting nearer —\\n“Scabbers — NO!”\\nToo late — the rat had slipped between Ron’s\\nclutching fingers, hit the ground, and scampered\\naway. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him,\\nand before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ron\\n \\nhad thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and\\npelted away into the darkness.\\n“Ron\\\\” Hermione moaned.\\nShe and Harry looked at each other, then followed at\\na sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the\\ncloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them\\nlike a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could\\nhear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts\\nat Crookshanks.\\n“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come\\nhere — ”\\nThere was a loud thud.\\n“Gotchal Get off, you stinking cat — ”\\nHarry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they\\nskidded to a stop right in front of him. He was\\nsprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in\\nhis pocket; he had both hands held tight over the\\nquivering lump.\\n“Ron — come on — back under the cloak — ”\\nHermione panted. “Dumbledore — the Minister —\\nthey’ll be coming back out in a minute — ”\\nBut before they could cover themselves again, before\\nthey could even catch their breath, they heard the\\nsoft pounding of gigantic paws. ... Something was\\nbounding toward them, quiet as a shadow — an\\nenormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog.\\nHarry reached for his wand, but too late — the dog\\nhad made an enormous leap and the front paws hit\\nhim on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl\\nof hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth —\\n \\nBut the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled\\noff him. Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were\\nbroken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it\\ngrowling as it skidded around for a new attack.\\nRon was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward\\nthem he pushed Harry aside; the dog’s jaws fastened\\ninstead around Ron’s outstretched arm. Harry lunged\\nforward, he seized a handful of the brute’s hair, but it\\nwas dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a\\nrag doll —\\nThen, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard\\nacross the face he was knocked off his feet again. He\\nheard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too.\\nHarry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his\\neyes —\\n“Lumos\\\\” he whispered.\\nThe wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree;\\nthey had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the\\nWhomping Willow and its branches were creaking as\\nthough in a high wind, whipping backward and\\nforward to stop them going nearer.\\nAnd there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog,\\ndragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots\\n— Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso\\nwere slipping out of sight —\\n“Ron!” Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy\\nbranch whipped lethally through the air and he was\\nforced backward again.\\nAll they could see now was one of Ron’s legs, which\\nhe had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the\\ndog from pulling him farther underground — but a\\n \\nhorrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron’s leg\\nhad broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished\\nfrom sight.\\n“Harry — we’ve got to go for help — ” Hermione\\ngasped; she was bleeding too; the Willow had cut her\\nacross the shoulder.\\n“No! That thing’s big enough to eat him; we haven’t\\ngot time — ”\\n“Harry — we’re never going to get through without\\nhelp — ”\\nAnother branch whipped down at them, twigs\\nclenched like knuckles.\\n“If that dog can get in, we can,” Harry panted, darting\\nhere and there, trying to find a way through the\\nvicious, swishing branches, but he couldn’t get an\\ninch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of\\nthe tree’s blows.\\n“Oh, help, help,” Hermione whispered frantically,\\ndancing uncertainly on the spot, “please ...”\\nCrookshanks darted forward. He slithered between\\nthe battering branches like a snake and placed his\\nfront paws upon a knot on the trunk.\\nAbruptly, as though the tree had been turned to\\nmarble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or\\nshook.\\n“Crookshanks!” Hermione whispered uncertainly. She\\nnow grasped Harry’s arm painfully hard. “How did he\\nknow — ?”\\n \\n“He’s friends with that dog,” said Harry grimly. “I’ve\\nseen them together. Come on — and keep your wand\\nout — ”\\nThey covered the distance to the trunk in seconds,\\nbut before they had reached the gap in the roots,\\nCrookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his\\nbottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward,\\nheadfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the\\nbottom of a very low tunnel. Crookshanks was a little\\nway along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry’s\\nwand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside\\nhim.\\n“Where’s Ron?” she whispered in a terrified voice.\\n“This way,” said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after\\nCrookshanks.\\n“Where does this tunnel come out?” Hermione asked\\nbreathlessly from behind him.\\n“I don’t know. ... It’s marked on the Marauder’s Map\\nbut Fred and George said no one’s ever gotten into it.\\n...It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it\\nwas heading for Hogsmeade. ...”\\nThey moved as fast as they could, bent almost double;\\nahead of them, Crookshanks ’s tail bobbed in and out\\nof view. On and on went the passage; it felt at least as\\nlong as the one to Honeydukes. ... All Harry could\\nthink of was Ron and what the enormous dog might\\nbe doing to him. ... He was drawing breath in sharp,\\npainful gasps, running at a crouch. ...\\nAnd then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it\\ntwisted, and Crookshanks had gone. Instead, Harry\\ncould see a patch of dim light through a small\\nopening.\\n \\nHe and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging\\nforward. Both raised their wands to see what lay\\nbeyond.\\nIt was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper\\nwas peeling from the walls; there were stains all over\\nthe floor; every piece of furniture was broken as\\nthough somebody had smashed it. The windows were\\nall boarded up.\\nHarry glanced at Hermione, who looked very\\nfrightened but nodded.\\nHarry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around.\\nThe room was deserted, but a door to their right stood\\nopen, leading to a shadowy hallway. Hermione\\nsuddenly grabbed Harry’s arm again. Her wide eyes\\nwere traveling around the boarded windows.\\n“Harry,” she whispered, “I think we’re in the Shrieking\\nShack.”\\nHarry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair\\nnear them. Large chunks had been torn out of it; one\\nof the legs had been ripped off entirely.\\n“Ghosts didn’t do that,” he said slowly.\\nAt that moment, there was a creak overhead.\\nSomething had moved upstairs. Both of them looked\\nup at the ceiling. Hermione ’s grip on Harry’s arm was\\nso tight he was losing feeling in his fingers. He raised\\nhis eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.\\nQuietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and\\nup the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered\\nin a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide\\nshiny stripe had been made by something being\\ndragged upstairs.\\n \\nThey reached the dark landing.\\n“Nox,” they whispered together, and the lights at the\\nend of their wands went out. Only one door was open.\\nAs they crept toward it, they heard movement from\\nbehind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring.\\nThey exchanged a last look, a last nod.\\nWand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door\\nwide open.\\nOn a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings\\nlay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them.\\nOn the floor beside him, clutching his leg, which\\nstuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.\\nHarry and Hermione dashed across to him.\\n“Ron — are you okay?”\\n“Where’s the dog?”\\n“Not a dog,” Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with\\npain. “Harry, it’s a trap — ”\\n“What — ”\\n“He’s the dog ... he’s an Animagus. ...”\\nRon was staring over Harry’s shoulder. Harry wheeled\\naround. With a snap, the man in the shadows closed\\nthe door behind them.\\nA mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If\\neyes hadn’t been shining out of the deep, dark\\nsockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy skin\\nwas stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it\\nlooked like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a\\ngrin. It was Sirius Black.\\n \\n“ ExpelliarmusV’ he croaked, pointing Ron’s wand at\\nthem.\\nHarry’s and Hermione’s wands shot out of their\\nhands, high in the air, and Black caught them. Then\\nhe took a step closer. His eyes were fixed on Harry.\\n“I thought you’d come and help your friend,” he said\\nhoarsely. His voice sounded as though he had long\\nsince lost the habit of using it. “Your father would\\nhave done the same for me. Brave of you, not to run\\nfor a teacher. I’m grateful ... it will make everything\\nmuch easier. ...”\\nThe taunt about his father rang in Harry’s ears as\\nthough Black had bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted\\nin Harry’s chest, leaving no place for fear. For the first\\ntime in his life, he wanted his wand back in his hand,\\nnot to defend himself, but to attack ... to kill. Without\\nknowing what he was doing, he started forward, but\\nthere was a sudden movement on either side of him\\nand two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him\\nback. ... “No, Harry!” Hermione gasped in a petrified\\nwhisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black.\\n“If you want to kill Harry, you’ll have to kill us too!”\\nhe said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright\\nwas draining him of still more color, and he swayed\\nslightly as he spoke.\\nSomething flickered in Black’s shadowed eyes.\\n“Lie down,” he said quietly to Ron. “You will damage\\nthat leg even more.”\\n“Did you hear me?” Ron said weakly, though he was\\nclinging painfully to Harry to stay upright. “You’ll\\nhave to kill all three of us!”\\n \\n“There’ll be only one murder here tonight,” said Black,\\nand his grin widened.\\n“Why’s that?” Harry spat, trying to wrench himself\\nfree of Ron and Hermione. “Didn’t care last time, did\\nyou? Didn’t mind slaughtering all those Muggles to\\nget at Pettigrew. ... What’s the matter, gone soft in\\nAzkaban?”\\n“Harry!” Hermione whimpered. “Be quiet!”\\n“HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!” Harry roared, and\\nwith a huge effort he broke free of Hermione ’s and\\nRon’s restraint and lunged forward —\\nHe had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that\\nhe was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black\\nwas a tall, full-grown man — all Harry knew was that\\nhe wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and\\nthat he didn’t care how much he got hurt in return —\\nPerhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so\\nstupid, but Black didn’t raise the wands in time —\\none of Harry’s hands fastened over his wasted wrist,\\nforcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry’s\\nother hand collided with the side of Black’s head and\\nthey fell, backward, into the wall —\\nHermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was\\na blinding flash as the wands in Black’s hand sent a\\njet of sparks into the air that missed Harry’s face by\\ninches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers\\ntwisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand\\npunching every part of Black it could find.\\nBut Black’s free hand had found Harry’s throat —\\n“No,” he hissed, “I’ve waited too long — ”\\n \\nThe fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses\\naskew.\\nThen he saw Hermione ’s foot swing out of nowhere.\\nBlack let go of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had\\nthrown himself on Black’s wand hand and Harry\\nheard a faint clatter —\\nHe fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own\\nwand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward\\nit but —\\n“Argh!”\\nCrookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front\\nclaws had sunk themselves deep into Harry’s arm;\\nHarry threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted\\ntoward Harry’s wand —\\n“NO YOU DONT!” roared Harry, and he aimed a kick\\nat Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside,\\nspitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned —\\n“Get out of the way!” he shouted at Ron and\\nHermione.\\nThey didn’t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for\\nbreath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching\\nup her and Ron’s wands. Ron crawled to the four-\\nposter and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face\\nnow tinged with green, both hands clutching his\\nbroken leg.\\nBlack was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin\\nchest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry\\nwalking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at\\nBlack’s heart.\\n“Going to kill me, Harry?” he whispered.\\n \\nHarry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing\\nat Black’s chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise\\nwas rising around Black’s left eye and his nose was\\nbleeding.\\n“You killed my parents,” said Harry, his voice shaking\\nslightly, but his wand hand quite steady.\\nBlack stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.\\n“I don’t deny it,” he said very quietly. “But if you knew\\nthe whole story.”\\n“The whole story?” Harry repeated, a furious\\npounding in his ears. “You sold them to Voldemort.\\nThat’s all I need to know.”\\n“You’ve got to listen to me,” Black said, and there was\\na note of urgency in his voice now. “You’ll regret it if\\nyou don’t. ... You don’t understand. ...”\\n“I understand a lot better than you think,” said Harry,\\nand his voice shook more than ever. “You never heard\\nher, did you? My mum ... trying to stop Voldemort\\nkilling me ... and you did that ... you did it. ...”\\nBefore either of them could say another word,\\nsomething ginger streaked past Harry; Crookshanks\\nleapt onto Black’s chest and settled himself there,\\nright over Black’s heart. Black blinked and looked\\ndown at the cat.\\n“Get off,” he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks\\noff him.\\nBut Crookshanks sank his claws into Black’s robes\\nand wouldn’t shift. He turned his ugly, squashed face\\nto Harry and looked up at him with those great yellow\\neyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.\\n \\nHarry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his\\ngrip tightening on the wand. So what if he had to kill\\nthe cat too? It was in league with Black. ... If it was\\nprepared to die, trying to protect Black, that wasn’t\\nHarry’s business. ... If Black wanted to save it, that\\nonly proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for\\nHarry’s parents. ...\\nHarry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it.\\nNow was the moment to avenge his mother and\\nfather. He was going to kill Black. He had to kill\\nBlack. This was his chance. ...\\nThe seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen\\nthere, wand poised, Black staring up at him,\\nCrookshanks on his chest. Ron’s ragged breathing\\ncame from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.\\nAnd then came a new sound —\\nMuffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor\\n— someone was moving downstairs.\\n“WE’RE UP HERE!” Hermione screamed suddenly.\\n“WE’RE UP HERE — SIRIUS BLACK — QUICK!”\\nBlack made a startled movement that almost\\ndislodged Crookshanks; Harry gripped his wand\\nconvulsively — Do it nouA said a voice in his head —\\nbut the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and\\nHarry still hadn’t done it.\\nThe door of the room burst open in a shower of red\\nsparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin\\ncame hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his\\nwand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron,\\nlying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the\\ndoor, to Harry, standing there with his wand covering\\n \\nBlack, and then to Black himself, crumpled and\\nbleeding at Harry’s feet.\\n“ ExpelliarmusV’ Lupin shouted.\\nHarry’s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did\\nthe two Hermione was holding. Lupin caught them all\\ndeftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black,\\nwho still had Crookshanks lying protectively across\\nhis chest.\\nHarry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn’t\\ndone it. His nerve had failed him. Black was going to\\nbe handed back to the dementors.\\nThen Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.\\n“Where is he, Sirius?”\\nHarry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn’t understand\\nwhat Lupin meant. Who was Lupin talking about? He\\nturned to look at Black again.\\nBlack’s face was quite expressionless. For a few\\nseconds, he didn’t move at all. Then, very slowly, he\\nraised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron.\\nMystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked\\nbewildered.\\n“But then ... ,” Lupin muttered, staring at Black so\\nintently it seemed he was trying to read his mind, \"...\\nwhy hasn’t he shown himself before now? Unless” —\\nLupin’s eyes suddenly widened, as though he was\\nseeing something beyond Black, something none of\\nthe rest could see, “ — unless he was the one ...\\nunless you switched . . . without telling me?”\\nVery slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin’s\\nface, Black nodded.\\n \\n“Professor,” Harry interrupted loudly, “what’s going\\non — ?”\\nBut he never finished the question, because what he\\nsaw made his voice die in his throat. Lupin was\\nlowering his wand, gazing fixedly at Black. The\\nProfessor walked to Black’s side, seized his hand,\\npulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the\\nfloor, and embraced Black like a brother.\\nHarry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of\\nhis stomach.\\n“I DONT BELIEVE IT!” Hermione screamed.\\nLupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had\\nraised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin,\\nwild-eyed. “You — you — ”\\n“Hermione — ”\\n“ — you and him!”\\n“Hermione, calm down — ”\\n“I didn’t tell anyone!” Hermione shrieked. “I’ve been\\ncovering up for you — ”\\n“Hermione, listen to me, please!” Lupin shouted. “I\\ncan explain — ”\\nHarry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but\\nwith a fresh wave of fury.\\n“I trusted you,” he shouted at Lupin, his voice\\nwavering out of control, “and all the time you’ve been\\nhis friend!”\\n \\n“You’re wrong,” said Lupin. “I haven’t been Sirius’s\\nfriend, but I am now — Let me explain. ...”\\n“NO!” Hermione screamed. “Harry, don’t trust him,\\nhe’s been helping Black get into the castle, he wants\\nyou dead too — he’s a werewolf.”\\nThere was a ringing silence. Everyone’s eyes were now\\non Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather\\npale.\\n“Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,” he\\nsaid. “Only one out of three, I’m afraid. I have not\\nbeen helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly\\ndon’t want Harry dead. ...” An odd shiver passed over\\nhis face. “But I won’t deny that I am a werewolf.”\\nRon made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back\\nwith a whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him,\\nlooking concerned, but Ron gasped,\\n“Get away from me, werewolf”\\nLupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he\\nturned to Hermione and said, “How long have you\\nknown?”\\n“Ages,” Hermione whispered. “Since I did Professor\\nSnape’s essay. ...”\\n“He’ll be delighted,” said Lupin coolly. “He assigned\\nthat essay hoping someone would realize what my\\nsymptoms meant. ... Did you check the lunar chart\\nand realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or\\ndid you realize that the boggart changed into the\\nmoon when it saw me?”\\n“Both,” Hermione said quietly.\\n \\nLupin forced a laugh.\\n“You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met,\\nHermione.”\\n“I’m not,” Hermione whispered. “If I’d been a bit\\ncleverer, I’d have told everyone what you are!”\\n“But they already know,” said Lupin. “At least, the\\nstaff do.”\\n“Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a\\nwerewolf?” Ron gasped. “Is he mad?”\\n“Some of the staff thought so,” said Lupin. “He had to\\nwork very hard to convince certain teachers that I’m\\ntrustworthy — ”\\n“AND HE WAS WRONG!” Harry yelled. “YOU VE BEEN\\nHELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!” He was pointing at\\nBlack, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed\\nand sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking\\nhand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped\\nonto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from both of\\nthem, dragging his leg.\\n“I have not been helping Sirius,” said Lupin. “If you’ll\\ngive me a chance, I’ll explain. Look — ”\\nHe separated Harry’s, Ron’s and Hermione’s wands\\nand threw each back to its owner; Harry caught his,\\nstunned.\\n“There,” said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into\\nhis belt. “You’re armed, we’re not. Now will you\\nlisten?”\\nHarry didn’t know what to think. Was it a trick?\\n \\n“If you haven’t been helping him,” he said, with a\\nfurious glance at Black, “how did you know he was\\nhere?”\\n“The map,” said Lupin. “The Marauder’s Map. I was in\\nmy office examining it — ”\\n“You know how to work it?” Harry said suspiciously.\\n“Of course I know how to work it,” said Lupin, waving\\nhis hand impatiently. “I helped write it. I’m Moony —\\nthat was my friends’ nickname for me at school.”\\n“You wrote — ?”\\n“The important thing is, I was watching it carefully\\nthis evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron,\\nand Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to\\nvisit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I\\nwas right, wasn’t I?”\\nHe had started to pace up and down, looking at them.\\nLittle patches of dust rose at his feet.\\n“You might have been wearing your father’s old cloak,\\nHarry — ”\\n“How d’you know about the cloak?”\\n“The number of times I saw James disappearing\\nunder it... ,” said Lupin, waving an impatient hand\\nagain. “The point is, even if you’re wearing an\\nInvisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s\\nMap. I watched you cross the grounds and enter\\nHagrid’s hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid,\\nand set off back toward the castle. But you were now\\naccompanied by somebody else.”\\n“What?” said Harry. “No, we weren’t!”\\n \\n“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” said Lupin, still pacing,\\nand ignoring Harry’s interruption. “I thought the map\\nmust be malfunctioning. How could he be with you?”\\n“No one was with us!” said Harry.\\n“And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you,\\nlabeled Sirius Black. ... I saw him collide with you; I\\nwatched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping\\nWillow — ”\\n“One of us!” Ron said angrily.\\n“No, Ron,” said Lupin. “Two of you.”\\nHe had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.\\n“Do you think I could have a look at the rat?” he said\\nevenly.\\n“What?” said Ron. “What’s Scabbers got to do with\\nit?”\\n“Everything,” said Lupin. “Could I see him, please?”\\nRon hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes.\\nScabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to\\nseize his long bald tail to stop him escaping.\\nCrookshanks stood up on Black’s leg and made a soft\\nhissing noise.\\nLupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding\\nhis breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.\\n“What?” Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to\\nhim, looking scared. “What’s my rat got to do with\\nanything?”\\n“That’s not a rat,” croaked Sirius Black suddenly.\\n \\n“What d’you mean — of course he’s a rat — ”\\n“No, he’s not,” said Lupin quietly. “He’s a wizard.”\\n“An Animagus,” said Black, “by the name of Peter\\nPettigrew.”\\n \\nMOONY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND\\nPRONGS\\nIt took a few seconds for the absurdity of this\\nstatement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry\\nwas thinking.\\n“You’re both mental.”\\n“Ridiculous!” said Hermione faintly.\\n“Peter Pettigrew’s dead!” said Harry. “He killed him\\ntwelve years ago!” He pointed at Black, whose face\\ntwitched convulsively.\\n“I meant to,” he growled, his yellow teeth bared, “but\\nlittle Peter got the better of me ... not this time,\\nthough!”\\nAnd Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black\\nlunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black’s\\nweight fell on his broken leg.\\n \\n“Sirius, NO!” Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards\\nand dragging Black away from Ron again, “WAIT! You\\ncan’t do it just like that — they need to understand —\\nwe’ve got to explain — ”\\n“We can explain afterwards!” snarled Black, trying to\\nthrow Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as\\nit tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a\\npiglet, scratching Ron’s face and neck as he tried to\\nescape.\\n“They’ve — got — a — right — to — know —\\neverything!” Lupin panted, still trying to restrain\\nBlack. “Ron’s kept him as a pet! There are parts of it\\neven I don’t understand! And Harry — you owe Harry\\nthe truth, Sirius!”\\nBlack stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes\\nwere still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly\\nunder Ron’s bitten, scratched, and bleeding hands.\\n“All right, then,” Black said, without taking his eyes\\noff the rat. “Tell them whatever you like. But make it\\nquick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was\\nimprisoned for. ...”\\n“You’re nutters, both of you,” said Ron shakily,\\nlooking round at Harry and Hermione for support.\\n“I’ve had enough of this. I’m off.”\\nHe tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but\\nLupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers.\\n“You’re going to hear me out, Ron,” he said quietly.\\n“Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.”\\n“HE’S NOT PETER, HE’S SCABBERS!” Ron yelled,\\ntrying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but\\nScabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed and\\n \\noverbalanced, and Harry caught him and pushed him\\nback down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry\\nturned to Lupin.\\n“There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,” he\\nsaid. “A whole street full of them ...”\\n“They didn’t see what they thought they saw!” said\\nBlack savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in\\nRon’s hands.\\n“Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,” said Lupin,\\nnodding. “I believed it myself — until I saw the map\\ntonight. Because the Marauder’s map never lies ...\\nPeter’s alive. Ron’s holding him, Harry.”\\nHarry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met,\\nthey agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out\\nof their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever.\\nHow could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban\\nmust have unhinged Black after all — but why was\\nLupin playing along with him?\\nThen Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm\\nsort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin\\nto talk sensibly.\\n“But Professor Lupin ... Scabbers can’t be Pettigrew\\n... it just can’t be true, you know it can’t ...”\\n“Why can’t it be true?” Lupin said calmly, as though\\nthey were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted\\na problem in an experiment with grindylows.\\n“Because . . . because people would know if Peter\\nPettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in\\nclass with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them\\nup when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic\\nkeeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become\\n \\nanimals; there’s a register showing what animal they\\nbecome, and their markings and things ... and I went\\nand looked Professor McGonagall up on the register,\\nand there have been only seven Animagi this century,\\nand Pettigrew’s name wasn’t on the list — ”\\nHarry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the\\neffort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin\\nstarted to laugh. “Right again, Hermione!” he said.\\n“But the Ministry never knew that there used to be\\nthree unregistered Animagi running around\\nHogwarts.”\\n“If you’re going to tell them the story, get a move on,\\nRemus,” snarled Black, who was still watching\\nScabbers’s every desperate move. “I’ve waited twelve\\nyears, I’m not going to wait much longer.”\\n“All right ... but you’ll need to help me, Sirius,” said\\nLupin, “I only know how it began ...”\\nLupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind\\nhim. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord.\\nAll five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward\\nit and looked out into the landing.\\n“No one there ...”\\n“This place is haunted!” said Ron.\\n“It’s not,” said Lupin, still looking at the door in a\\npuzzled way. “The Shrieking Shack was never\\nhaunted. ... The screams and howls the villagers used\\nto hear were made by me.”\\nHe pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought\\nfor a moment, then said, “That’s where all of this\\nstarts — with my becoming a werewolf. None of this\\n \\ncould have happened if I hadn’t been bitten ... and if I\\nhadn’t been so foolhardy. ...”\\nHe looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt,\\nbut Hermione said, “Shh!” She was watching Lupin\\nvery intently.\\n“I was a very small boy when I received the bite. My\\nparents tried everything, but in those days there was\\nno cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been\\nmaking for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me\\nsafe, you see. As long as I take it in the week\\npreceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I\\ntransform. ... I am able to curl up in my office, a\\nharmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.\\n“Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered,\\nhowever, I became a fully fledged monster once a\\nmonth. It seemed impossible that I would be able to\\ncome to Hogwarts. Other parents weren’t likely to\\nwant their children exposed to me.\\n“But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he\\nwas sympathetic. He said that as long as we took\\ncertain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn’t\\ncome to school. ...” Lupin sighed, and looked directly\\nat Harry. “I told you, months ago, that the Whomping\\nWillow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The\\ntruth is that it was planted because I came to\\nHogwarts. This house” — Lupin looked miserably\\naround the room, — “the tunnel that leads to it —\\nthey were built for my use. Once a month, I was\\nsmuggled out of the castle, into this place, to\\ntransform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth\\nto stop anyone coming across me while I was\\ndangerous.”\\nHarry couldn’t see where this story was going, but he\\nwas listening raptly all the same. The only sound\\n \\napart from Lupin’s voice was Scabbers’s frightened\\nsqueaking.\\n“My transformations in those days were — were\\nterrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I\\nwas separated from humans to bite, so I bit and\\nscratched myself instead. The villagers heard the\\nnoise and the screaming and thought they were\\nhearing particularly violent spirits. Dumbledore\\nencouraged the rumor. . . . Even now, when the house\\nhas been silent for years, the villagers don’t dare\\napproach it. ...\\n“But apart from my transformations, I was happier\\nthan I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever,\\nI had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black ...\\nPeter Pettigrew ... and, of course, your father, Harry\\n— James Potter.\\n“Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that\\nI disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of\\nstories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had\\nto go home to see her. ... I was terrified they would\\ndesert me the moment they found out what I was. But\\nof course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the\\ntruth. ...\\n“And they didn’t desert me at all. Instead, they did\\nsomething for me that would make my\\ntransformations not only bearable, but the best times\\nof my life. They became Animagi.”\\n“My dad too?” said Harry, astounded.\\n“Yes, indeed,” said Lupin. “It took them the best part\\nof three years to work out how to do it. Your father\\nand Sirius here were the cleverest students in the\\nschool, and lucky they were, because the Animagus\\ntransformation can go horribly wrong — one reason\\n \\nthe Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting\\nto do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from\\nJames and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they\\nmanaged it. They could each turn into a different\\nanimal at will.”\\n“But how did that help you?” said Hermione,\\nsounding puzzled.\\n“They couldn’t keep me company as humans, so they\\nkept me company as animals,” said Lupin. “A\\nwerewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out\\nof the castle every month under James’s Invisibility\\nCloak. They transformed . . . Peter, as the smallest,\\ncould slip beneath the Willow’s attacking branches\\nand touch the knot that freezes it. They would then\\nslip down the tunnel and join me. Under their\\ninfluence, I became less dangerous. My body was still\\nwolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while\\nI was with them.”\\n“Hurry up, Remus,” snarled Black, who was still\\nwatching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on\\nhis face.\\n“I’m getting there, Sirius, I’m getting there ... well,\\nhighly exciting possibilities were open to us now that\\nwe could all transform. Soon we were leaving the\\nShrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and\\nthe village by night. Sirius and James transformed\\ninto such large animals, they were able to keep a\\nwerewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts\\nstudents ever found out more about the Hogwarts\\ngrounds and Hogsmeade than we did. ... And that’s\\nhow we came to write the Marauder’s Map, and sign it\\nwith our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is\\nWormtail. James was Prongs.”\\n \\n“What sort of animal — ?” Harry began, but Hermione\\ncut him off.\\n“That was still really dangerous! Running around in\\nthe dark with a werewolf! What if you’d given the\\nothers the slip, and bitten somebody?”\\n“A thought that still haunts me,” said Lupin heavily.\\n“And there were near misses, many of them. We\\nlaughed about them afterwards. We were young,\\nthoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness.”\\n“I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore’s\\ntrust, of course ... he had admitted me to Hogwarts\\nwhen no other headmaster would have done so, and\\nhe had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set\\ndown for my own and others’ safety. He never knew I\\nhad led three fellow students into becoming Animagi\\nillegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty\\nfeelings every time we sat down to plan our next\\nmonth’s adventure. And I haven’t changed ...”\\nLupin’s face had hardened, and there was self-disgust\\nin his voice. “All this year, I have been battling with\\nmyself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore\\nthat Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn’t do it. Why?\\nBecause I was too cowardly. It would have meant\\nadmitting that I’d betrayed his trust while I was at\\nschool, admitting that I’d led others along with me ...\\nand Dumbledore’s trust has meant everything to me.\\nHe let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a\\njob when I have been shunned all my adult life,\\nunable to find paid work because of what I am. And\\nso I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the\\nschool using dark arts he learned from Voldemort,\\nthat being an Animagus had nothing to do with it . . .\\nso, in a way, Snape’s been right about me all along.”\\n \\n“Snape?” said Black harshly, taking his eyes off\\nScabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up\\nat Lupin. “What’s Snape got to do with it?”\\n“He’s here, Sirius,” said Lupin heavily. “He’s teaching\\nhere as well.” He looked up at Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione.\\n“Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought\\nvery hard against my appointment to the Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts job. He has been telling\\nDumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. He\\nhas his reasons ... you see, Sirius here played a trick\\non him which nearly killed him, a trick which\\ninvolved me — ”\\nBlack made a derisive noise.\\n“It served him right,” he sneered. “Sneaking around,\\ntrying to find out what we were up to . . . hoping he\\ncould get us expelled. ...”\\n“Severus was very interested in where I went every\\nmonth.” Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “We\\nwere in the same year, you know, and we — er —\\ndidn’t like each other very much. He especially\\ndisliked James. Jealous, I think, of James’s talent on\\nthe Quidditch field . . . anyway Snape had seen me\\ncrossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one\\nevening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow\\nto transform. Sirius thought it would be — er —\\namusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the\\nknot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he’d be\\nable to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it\\n— if he’d got as far as this house, he’d have met a\\nfully grown werewolf — but your father, who’d heard\\nwhat Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled\\nhim back, at great risk to his life . . . Snape glimpsed\\nme, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was\\n \\nforbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from\\nthat time on he knew what I was. ...”\\n“So that’s why Snape doesn’t like you,” said Harry\\nslowly, “because he thought you were in on the joke?”\\n“That’s right,” sneered a cold voice from the wall\\nbehind Lupin.\\nSeverus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak,\\nhis wand pointing directly at Lupin.\\n \\nTHE SERVANT OF LORD\\nVOLDERMORT\\nHermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt\\nas though he’d received a huge electric shock.\\n“I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,”\\nsaid Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep\\nthis wand pointing directly at Lupin’s chest. “Very\\nuseful, Potter, I thank you. ...”\\nSnape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of\\nsuppressed triumph. “You’re wondering, perhaps,\\nhow I knew you were here?” he said, his eyes\\nglittering. “I’ve just been to your office, Lupin. You\\nforgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful\\nalong. And very lucky I did ... lucky for me, I mean.\\nLying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at\\nit told me all I needed to know. I saw you running\\nalong this passageway and out of sight.”\\n“Severus — ” Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.\\n \\n“I’ve told the headmaster again and again that you’re\\nhelping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin,\\nand here’s the proof. Not even I dreamed you would\\nhave the nerve to use this old place as your hideout\\n“Severus, you’re making a mistake,” said Lupin\\nurgently. “You haven’t heard everything — I can\\nexplain — Sirius is not here to kill Harry — ”\\n“Two more for Azkaban tonight,” said Snape, his eyes\\nnow gleaming fanatically. “I shall be interested to see\\nhow Dumbledore takes this. ... He was quite\\nconvinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin ... a\\ntame werewolf — ”\\n“You fool,” said Lupin softly. “Is a schoolboy grudge\\nworth putting an innocent man back inside\\nAzkaban?”\\nBANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of\\nSnape’s wand and twisted themselves around Lupin’s\\nmouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell\\nto the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage,\\nBlack started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his\\nwand straight between Black’s eyes.\\n“Give me a reason,” he whispered. “Give me a reason\\nto do it, and I swear I will.”\\nBlack stopped dead. It would have been impossible to\\nsay which face showed more hatred.\\nHarry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do\\nor whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and\\nHermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still\\nfighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers.\\nHermione, however, took an uncertain step toward\\nSnape and said, in a very breathless voice, “Professor\\n \\nSnape — it — it wouldn’t hurt to hear what they’ve\\ngot to say, w — would it?”\\n“Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension\\nfrom this school,” Snape spat. “You, Potter, and\\nWeasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a\\nconvicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your\\nlife, hold your tongue.”\\n“But if — if there was a mistake — ”\\n“KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!” Snape shouted,\\nlooking suddenly quite deranged. “DONT TALK\\nABOUT WHAT YOU DONT UNDERSTAND!” A few\\nsparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was\\nstill pointed at Black’s face. Hermione fell silent.\\n“Vengeance is very sweet,” Snape breathed at Black.\\n“How I hoped I would be the one to catch you. ...”\\n“The joke’s on you again, Severus,” Black snarled. “As\\nlong as this boy brings his rat up to the castle” — he\\njerked his head at Ron — “I’ll come quietly. ...”\\n“Up to the castle?” said Snape silkily. “I don’t think\\nwe need to go that far. All I have to do is call the\\ndementors once we get out of the Willow. They’ll be\\nvery pleased to see you, Black ... pleased enough to\\ngive you a little kiss, I daresay. ...”\\nWhat little color there was in Black’s face left it.\\n“You — you’ve got to hear me out,” he croaked. “The\\nrat — look at the rat — ”\\nBut there was a mad glint in Snape ’s eyes that Harry\\nhad never seen before. He seemed beyond reason.\\n \\n“Come on, all of you,” he said. He clicked his fingers,\\nand the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to\\nhis hands. “Ill drag the werewolf. Perhaps the\\ndementors will have a kiss for him too — ”\\nBefore he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed\\nthe room in three strides and blocked the door.\\n“Get out of the way, Potter, you’re in enough trouble\\nalready,” snarled Snape. “If I hadn’t been here to save\\nyour skin — ”\\n“Professor Lupin could have killed me about a\\nhundred times this year,” Harry said. “I’ve been alone\\nwith him loads of times, having defense lessons\\nagainst the dementors. If he was helping Black, why\\ndidn’t he just finish me off then?”\\n“Don’t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf’s mind\\nworks,” hissed Snape. “Get out of the way, Potter.”\\n“YOU’RE PATHETIC!” Harry yelled. “JUST BECAUSE\\nTHEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU\\nWONT EVEN LISTEN — ”\\n“SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!”\\nSnape shrieked, looking madder than ever. “Like\\nfather, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck;\\nyou should be thanking me on bended knee! You\\nwould have been well served if he’d killed you! You’d\\nhave died like your father, too arrogant to believe you\\nmight be mistaken in Black — now get out of the way,\\nor I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!”\\nHarry made up his mind in a split second. Before\\nSnape could take even one step toward him, he had\\nraised his wand.\\n \\n“ Expelliarmus\\\\” he yelled — except that his wasn’t the\\nonly voice that shouted. There was a blast that made\\nthe door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his\\nfeet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to\\nthe floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair.\\nHe had been knocked out.\\nHarry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had\\ntried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment.\\nSnape ’s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the\\nbed next to Crookshanks.\\n“You shouldn’t have done that,” said Black, looking at\\nHarry. “You should have left him to me. ...”\\nHarry avoided Black’s eyes. He wasn’t sure, even now,\\nthat he’d done the right thing.\\n“We attacked a teacher. ... We attacked a teacher ... ,”\\nHermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape\\nwith frightened eyes. “Oh, we’re going to be in so\\nmuch trouble — ”\\nLupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent\\ndown quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up,\\nrubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them.\\n“Thank you, Harry,” he said.\\n“I’m still not saying I believe you,” he told Lupin.\\n“Then it’s time we offered you some proof,” said\\nLupin. “You, boy — give me Peter, please. Now.”\\nRon clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.\\n“Come off it,” he said weakly. “Are you trying to say\\nhe broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on\\nScabbers ? I mean ...” He looked up at Harry and\\n \\nHermione for support, “Okay, say Pettigrew could\\nturn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how’s he\\nsupposed to know which one he’s after if he was\\nlocked up in Azkaban?”\\n“You know, Sirius, that’s a fair question,” said Lupin,\\nturning to Black and frowning slightly. “How did you\\nfind out where he was?”\\nBlack put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes\\nand took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he\\nsmoothed flat and held out to show the others.\\nIt was the photograph of Ron and his family that had\\nappeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer,\\nand there, on Ron’s shoulder, was Scabbers.\\n“How did you get this?” Lupin asked Black,\\nthunderstruck.\\n“Fudge,” said Black. “When he came to inspect\\nAzkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And there\\nwas Peter, on the front page ... on this boy’s shoulder.\\n... I knew him at once . . . how many times had I seen\\nhim transform? And the caption said the boy would\\nbe going back to Hogwarts ... to where Harry was. ...”\\n“My God,” said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to\\nthe picture in the paper and back again. “His front\\npaw ...”\\n“What about it?” said Ron defiantly.\\n“He’s got a toe missing,” said Black.\\n“Of course,” Lupin breathed. “So simple ... so brilliant\\n... he cut it off himself?”\\n \\n“Just before he transformed,” said Black. “When I\\ncornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear\\nthat I’d betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could\\ncurse him, he blew apart the street with the wand\\nbehind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of\\nhimself — and sped down into the sewer with the\\nother rats. ...”\\n“Didn’t you ever hear, Ron?” said Lupin. “The biggest\\nbit of Peter they found was his finger.”\\n“Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat\\nor something! He’s been in my family for ages, right —\\n“Twelve years, in fact,” said Lupin. “Didn’t you ever\\nwonder why he was living so long?”\\n“We — we’ve been taking good care of him!” said Ron.\\n“Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?”\\nsaid Lupin. “I’d guess he’s been losing weight ever\\nsince he heard Sirius was on the loose again. ...”\\n“He’s been scared of that mad cat!” said Ron, nodding\\ntoward Crookshanks, who was still purring on the\\nbed.\\nBut that wasn’t right, Harry thought suddenly. ...\\nScabbers had been looking ill before he met\\nCrookshanks . . . ever since Ron’s return from Egypt . . .\\nsince the time when Black had escaped. ...\\n“This cat isn’t mad,” said Black hoarsely. He reached\\nout a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks ’s fluffy\\nhead. “He’s the most intelligent of his kind I’ve ever\\nmet. He recognized Peter for what he was right away.\\nAnd when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a\\nwhile before he trusted me. ... Finally, I managed to\\n \\ncommunicate to him what I was after, and he’s been\\nhelping me. ...”\\n“What do you mean?” breathed Hermione.\\n“He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn’t ... so he\\nstole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me. ...\\nAs I understand it, he took them from a boy’s bedside\\ntable. ...”\\nHarry’s brain seemed to be sagging under the weight\\nof what he was hearing. It was absurd . . . and yet . . .\\n“But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for\\nit. ...” croaked Black. “This cat — Crookshanks, did\\nyou call him? — told me Peter had left blood on the\\nsheets. ... I supposed he bit himself. ... Well, faking\\nhis own death had worked once. ...”\\nThese words jolted Harry to his senses.\\n“And why did he fake his death?” he said furiously.\\n“Because he knew you were about to kill him like you\\nkilled my parents!”\\n“No,” said Lupin, “Harry — ”\\n“And now you’ve come to finish him off!”\\n“Yes, I have,” said Black, with an evil look at\\nScabbers.\\n“Then I should’ve let Snape take you!” Harry shouted.\\n“Harry,” said Lupin hurriedly, “don’t you see? All this\\ntime we’ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and\\nPeter tracked him down — but it was the other way\\naround, don’t you see? Peter betrayed your mother\\nand father — Sirius tracked Peter down — ”\\n \\n“THAT’S NOT TRUE!” Harry yelled. “HE WAS THEIR\\nSECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU\\nTURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!”\\nHe was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly;\\nthe sunken eyes were suddenly overbright.\\n“Harry ... I as good as killed them,” he croaked. “I\\npersuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the\\nlast moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-\\nKeeper instead of me. ... I’m to blame, I know it. ...\\nThe night they died, I’d arranged to check on Peter,\\nmake sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his\\nhiding place, he’d gone. Yet there was no sign of a\\nstruggle. It didn’t feel right. I was scared. I set out for\\nyour parents’ house straight away. And when I saw\\ntheir house, destroyed, and their bodies ... I realized\\nwhat Peter must’ve done ... what I’d done. ...”\\nHis voice broke. He turned away.\\n“Enough of this,” said Lupin, and there was a steely\\nnote in his voice Harry had never heard before.\\n“There’s one certain way to prove what really\\nhappened. Ron, give me that rat”\\n“What are you going to do with him if I give him to\\nyou?” Ron asked Lupin tensely.\\n“Force him to show himself,” said Lupin. “If he really\\nis a rat, it won’t hurt him.”\\nRon hesitated. Then at long last, he held out\\nScabbers and Lupin took him. Scabbers began to\\nsqueak without stopping, twisting and turning, his\\ntiny black eyes bulging in his head.\\n“Ready, Sirius?” said Lupin.\\n \\nBlack had already retrieved Snape’s wand from the\\nbed. He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and\\nhis wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his\\nface.\\n“Together?” he said quietly.\\n“I think so,” said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in\\none hand and his wand in the other. “On the count of\\nthree. One — two — THREE!”\\nA flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands;\\nfor a moment, Scabbers was frozen in midair, his\\nsmall gray form twisting madly — Ron yelled — the\\nrat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding\\nflash of light and then —\\nIt was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing\\ntree. A head was shooting upward from the ground;\\nlimbs were sprouting; a moment later, a man was\\nstanding where Scabbers had been, cringing and\\nwringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and\\nsnarling on the bed; the hair on his back was\\nstanding up.\\nHe was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry\\nand Hermione. His thin, colorless hair was unkempt\\nand there was a large bald patch on top. He had the\\nshrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a\\nlot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby,\\nalmost like Scabbers ’s fur, and something of the rat\\nlingered around his pointed nose and his very small,\\nwatery eyes. He looked around at them all, his\\nbreathing fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to\\nthe door and back again.\\n“Well, hello, Peter,” said Lupin pleasantly, as though\\nrats frequently erupted into old school friends around\\nhim. “Long time, no see.”\\n \\n“S — Sirius ... R — Remus ...” Even Pettigrew’s voice\\nwas squeaky. Again, his eyes darted toward the door.\\n“My friends ... my old friends ...”\\nBlack’s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around\\nthe wrist, gave him a warning look, then turned again\\nto Pettigrew, his voice light and casual.\\n“We’ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what\\nhappened the night Lily and James died. You might\\nhave missed the finer points while you were\\nsqueaking around down there on the bed — ”\\n“Remus,” gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see\\nbeads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, “you\\ndon’t believe him, do you... ? He tried to kill me,\\nRemus. ...”\\n“So we’ve heard,” said Lupin, more coldly. “I’d like to\\nclear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if\\nyou’d be so — ”\\n“He’s come to try and kill me again!” Pettigrew\\nsqueaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw\\nthat he used his middle finger, because his index was\\nmissing. “He killed Lily and James and now he’s going\\nto kill me too. ... You’ve got to help me, Remus. ...”\\nBlack’s face looked more skull-like than ever as he\\nstared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes.\\n“No one’s going to try and kill you until we’ve sorted a\\nfew things out,” said Lupin.\\n“Sorted things out?” squealed Pettigrew, looking\\nwildly about him once more, eyes taking in the\\nboarded windows and, again, the only door. “I knew\\nhe’d come after me! I knew he’d be back for me! I’ve\\nbeen waiting for this for twelve years!”\\n \\n“You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?”\\nsaid Lupin, his brow furrowed. “When nobody has\\never done it before?”\\n“He’s got dark powers the rest of us can only dream\\nof!” Pettigrew shouted shrilly. “How else did he get out\\nof there? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\ntaught him a few tricks!”\\nBlack started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh\\nthat filled the whole room.\\n“Voldemort, teach me tricks?” he said.\\nPettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a\\nwhip at him.\\n“What, scared to hear your old master’s name?” said\\nBlack. “I don’t blame you, Peter. His lot aren’t very\\nhappy with you, are they?”\\n“Don’t know what you mean, Sirius — ” muttered\\nPettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His whole\\nface was shining with sweat now.\\n“You haven’t been hiding from me for twelve years,”\\nsaid Black. “You’ve been hiding from Voldemort’s old\\nsupporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter. ... They\\nall think you’re dead, or you’d have to answer to\\nthem. ... I’ve heard them screaming all sorts of things\\nin their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-\\ncrosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the\\nPotters’ on your information ... and Voldemort met his\\ndownfall there. And not all Voldemort’s supporters\\nended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty\\nout here, biding their time, pretending they’ve seen\\nthe error of their ways. ... If they ever got wind that\\nyou were still alive, Peter — ”\\n \\n“Don’t know ... what you’re talking about... said\\nPettigrew again, more shrilly than ever. He wiped his\\nface on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. “You don’t\\nbelieve this — this madness, Remus — ”\\n“I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in\\nunderstanding why an innocent man would want to\\nspend twelve years as a rat,” said Lupin evenly.\\n“Innocent, but scared!” squealed Pettigrew. “If\\nVoldemort’s supporters were after me, it was because\\nI put one of their best men in Azkaban — the spy,\\nSirius Black!”\\nBlack’s face contorted.\\n“How dare you,” he growled, sounding suddenly like\\nthe bear-sized dog he had been. “I, a spy for\\nVoldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who\\nwere stronger and more powerful than myself? But\\nyou, Peter — I’ll never understand why I didn’t see\\nyou were the spy from the start. You always liked big\\nfriends who’d look after you, didn’t you? It used to be\\nus ... me and Remus ... and James. ...”\\nPettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting\\nfor breath.\\n“Me, a spy ... must be out of your mind ... never ...\\ndon’t know how you can say such a — ”\\n“Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper\\nbecause I suggested it,” Black hissed, so venomously\\nthat Pettigrew took a step backward. “I thought it was\\nthe perfect plan ... a bluff. ... Voldemort would be\\nsure to come after me, would never dream they’d use\\na weak, talentless thing like you. ... It must have been\\nthe finest moment of your miserable life, telling\\nVoldemort you could hand him the Potters.”\\n \\nPettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught\\nwords like “far-fetched” and “lunacy,” but he couldn’t\\nhelp paying more attention to the ashen color of\\nPettigrew’s face and the way his eyes continued to\\ndart toward the windows and door.\\n“Professor Lupin?” said Hermione timidly. “Can — can\\nI say something?”\\n“Certainly, Hermione,” said Lupin courteously.\\n“Well — Scabbers — I mean, this — this man — he’s\\nbeen sleeping in Harry’s dormitory for three years. If\\nhe’s working for You-Know-Who, how come he never\\ntried to hurt Harry before now?”\\n“There!” said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with\\nhis maimed hand. “Thank you! You see, Remus? I\\nhave never hurt a hair of Harry’s head! Why should\\nI?”\\n“I’ll tell you why,” said Black. “Because you never did\\nanything for anyone unless you could see what was in\\nit for you. Voldemort’s been in hiding for fifteen years,\\nthey say he’s half dead. You weren’t about to commit\\nmurder right under Albus Dumbledore’s nose, for a\\nwreck of a wizard who’d lost all of his power, were\\nyou? You’d want to be quite sure he was the biggest\\nbully in the playground before you went back to him,\\nwouldn’t you? Why else did you find a wizard family\\nto take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren’t\\nyou, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained\\nstrength, and it was safe to rejoin him. ...”\\nPettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several\\ntimes. He seemed to have lost the ability to talk.\\n“Er — Mr. Black — Sirius?” said Hermione.\\n \\nBlack jumped at being addressed like this and stared\\nat Hermione as though he had never seen anything\\nquite like her.\\n“If you don’t mind me asking, how — how did you get\\nout of Azkaban, if you didn’t use Dark Magic?”\\n“Thank you!” gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at\\nher. “Exactly! Precisely what I — ”\\nBut Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was\\nfrowning slightly at Hermione, but not as though he\\nwere annoyed with her. He seemed to be pondering\\nhis answer.\\n“I don’t know how I did it,” he said slowly. “I think the\\nonly reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was\\ninnocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the\\ndementors couldn’t suck it out of me ... but it kept me\\nsane and knowing who I am . . . helped me keep my\\npowers ... so when it all became . . . too much ... I\\ncould transform in my cell . . . become a dog.\\nDementors can’t see, you know. ...” He swallowed.\\n“They feel their way toward people by feeding off their\\nemotions. ... They could tell that my feelings were less\\n— less human, less complex when I was a dog ... but\\nthey thought, of course, that I was losing my mind\\nlike everyone else in there, so it didn’t trouble them.\\nBut I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of\\ndriving them away from me without a wand. ...\\n“But then I saw Peter in that picture ... I realized he\\nwas at Hogwarts with Harry . . . perfectly positioned to\\nact, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side\\nwas gathering strength again. ...”\\nPettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing\\nnoiselessly, but staring all the while at Black as\\nthough hypnotized.\\n \\n\"... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of\\nallies ... and to deliver the last Potter to them. If he\\ngave them Harry, who’d dare say he’d betrayed Lord\\nVoldemort? He’d be welcomed back with honors. ...\\n“So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one\\nwho knew Peter was still alive. ...”\\nHarry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs.\\nWeasley. “The guards say he’s been talking in his\\nsleep ... always the same words ... ‘He’s at Hog warts.’\\n“It was as if someone had lit a fire in my head, and\\nthe dementors couldn’t destroy it. ... It wasn’t a\\nhappy feeling ... it was an obsession . . . but it gave me\\nstrength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they\\nopened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as\\na dog. ... It’s so much harder for them to sense\\nanimal emotions that they were confused. ... I was\\nthin, very thin . . . thin enough to slip through the\\nbars. ... I swam as a dog back to the mainland. ... I\\njourneyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts\\ngrounds as a dog. I’ve been living in the forest ever\\nsince, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of\\ncourse. You fly as well as your father did, Harry. ...”\\nHe looked at Harry, who did not look away.\\n“Believe me,” croaked Black. “Believe me, Harry. I\\nnever betrayed James and Lily. I would have died\\nbefore I betrayed them.”\\nAnd at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight\\nto speak, he nodded.\\n“No!”\\n \\nPettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry’s\\nnod had been his own death sentence. He shuffled\\nforward on his knees, groveling, his hands clasped in\\nfront of him as though praying.\\n“Sirius — it’s me ... it’s Peter ... your friend ... you\\nwouldn’t ...”\\nBlack kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.\\n“There’s enough filth on my robes without you\\ntouching them,” said Black.\\n“Remus!” Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin\\ninstead, writhing imploringly in front of him. “You\\ndon’t believe this ... wouldn’t Sirius have told you\\nthey’d changed the plan?”\\n“Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,” said Lupin. “I\\nassume that’s why you didn’t tell me, Sirius?” he said\\ncasually over Pettigrew’s head.\\n“Forgive me, Remus,” said Black.\\n“Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,” said Lupin, who was\\nnow rolling up his sleeves. “And will you, in turn,\\nforgive me for believing you were the spy?”\\n“Of course,” said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted\\nacross his gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his\\nsleeves. “Shall we kill him together?”\\n“Yes, I think so,” said Lupin grimly.\\n“You wouldn’t ... you won’t... ,” gasped Pettigrew. And\\nhe scrambled around to Ron.\\n \\n“Ron ... haven’t I been a good friend ... a good pet?\\nYou won’t let them kill me, Ron, will you ... you’re on\\nmy side, aren’t you?”\\nBut Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost\\nrevulsion.\\n“I let you sleep in my bed\\\\” he said.\\n“Kind boy ... kind master ...” Pettigrew crawled toward\\nRon, “you won’t let them do it. ... I was your rat. ... I\\nwas a good pet. ...”\\n“If you made a better rat than a human, it’s not much\\nto boast about, Peter,” said Black harshly. Ron, going\\nstill paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of\\nPettigrew’s reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees,\\nstaggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione’s\\nrobes.\\n“Sweet girl ... clever girl ... you — you won’t let them.\\n... Help me. ...”\\nHermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew’s\\nclutching hands and backed away against the wall,\\nlooking horrified.\\nPettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and turned\\nhis head slowly toward Harry.\\n“Harry ... Harry ... you look just like your father ...\\njust like him. ...”\\n“HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?” roared Black.\\n“HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK\\nABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?”\\n“Harry,” whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him,\\nhands outstretched. “Harry, James wouldn’t have\\n \\nwanted me killed. ... James would have understood,\\nHarry ... he would have shown me mercy. ...”\\nBoth Black and Lupin strode forward, seized\\nPettigrew’s shoulders, and threw him backward onto\\nthe floor. He sat there, twitching with terror, staring\\nup at them.\\n“You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,” said Black,\\nwho was shaking too. “Do you deny it?”\\nPettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch,\\nlike an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor.\\n“Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark\\nLord . . . you have no idea ... he has weapons you can’t\\nimagine. ... I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave\\nlike you and Remus and James. I never meant it to\\nhappen. ... He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me —\\n“DONT LIE!” bellowed Black. “YOU’D BEEN PASSING\\nINFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY\\nAND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!”\\n“He — he was taking over everywhere!” gasped\\nPettigrew. “Wh — what was there to be gained by\\nrefusing him?”\\n“What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil\\nwizard who has ever existed?” said Black, with a\\nterribly fury in his face. “Only innocent lives, Peter!”\\n“You don’t understand!” whined Pettigrew. “He would\\nhave killed me, Sirius!”\\n“THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!” roared Black.\\n“DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS\\nWE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!”\\n \\nBlack and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands\\nraised.\\n“You should have realized,” said Lupin quietly, “if\\nVoldemort didn’t kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter.”\\nHermione covered her face with her hands and turned\\nto the wall.\\n“NO!” Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in\\nfront of Pettigrew, facing the wands. “You can’t kill\\nhim,” he said breathlessly. “You can’t.”\\nBlack and Lupin both looked staggered.\\n“Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no\\nparents,” Black snarled. “This cringing bit of filth\\nwould have seen you die too, without turning a hair.\\nYou heard him. His own stinking skin meant more to\\nhim than your whole family.”\\n“I know,” Harry panted. “We’ll take him up to the\\ncastle. We’ll hand him over to the dementors. ... He\\ncan go to Azkaban ... but don’t kill him.”\\n“Harry!” gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms\\naround Harry’s knees. “You — thank you — it’s more\\nthan I deserve — thank you — ”\\n“Get off me,” Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew’s hands\\noff him in disgust. “I’m not doing this for you. I’m\\ndoing it because — I don’t reckon my dad would’ve\\nwanted them to become killers — just for you.”\\nNo one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew,\\nwhose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched\\nhis chest. Black and Lupin were looking at each\\nother. Then, with one movement, they lowered their\\nwands.\\n \\n“You’re the only person who has the right to decide,\\nHarry,” said Black. “But think ... think what he did.\\n“He can go to Azkaban,” Harry repeated. “If anyone\\ndeserves that place, he does. ...”\\nPettigrew was still wheezing behind him.\\n“Very well,” said Lupin. “Stand aside, Harry.”\\nHarry hesitated.\\n“I’m going to tie him up,” said Lupin. “That’s all, I\\nswear.”\\nHarry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from\\nLupin’s wand this time, and next moment, Pettigrew\\nwas wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged.\\n“But if you transform, Peter,” growled Black, his own\\nwand pointing at Pettigrew too, “we will kill you. You\\nagree, Harry?”\\nHarry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor\\nand nodded so that Pettigrew could see him.\\n“Right,” said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. “Ron, I\\ncan’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey,\\nso I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we\\ncan get you to the hospital wing.”\\nHe hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron’s leg\\nwith his wand, and muttered, “Ferula.” Bandages\\nspun up Ron’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.\\nLupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight\\ngingerly on the leg and didn’t wince.\\n“That’s better,” he said. “Thanks.”\\n \\n“What about Professor Snape?” said Hermione in a\\nsmall voice, looking down at Snape’s prone figure.\\n“There’s nothing seriously wrong with him,” said\\nLupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse.\\n“You were just a little — overenthusiastic. Still out\\ncold. Er — perhaps it will be best if we don’t revive\\nhim until we’re safely back in the castle. We can take\\nhim like this. ...”\\nHe muttered, “Mobilicorpus.” As though invisible\\nstrings were tied to Snape’s wrists, neck, and knees,\\nhe was pulled into a standing position, head still\\nlolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung\\na few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling.\\nLupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it\\nsafely into his pocket.\\n“And two of us should be chained to this,” said Black,\\nnudging Pettigrew with his toe. “Just to make sure.”\\n“I’ll do it,” said Lupin.\\n“And me,” said Ron savagely, limping forward.\\nBlack conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon\\nPettigrew was upright again, left arm chained to\\nLupin’s right, right arm to Ron’s left. Ron’s face was\\nset. He seemed to have taken Scabbers’s true identity\\nas a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the\\nbed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush\\ntail held jauntily high.\\n \\nTHE DEMENTOR’S KISS\\nHarry had never been part of a stranger group.\\nCrookshanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin,\\nPettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like entrants in\\na six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting\\ncreepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they\\ndescended, held up by his own wand, which was\\nbeing pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and Hermione\\nbrought up the rear.\\nGetting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin,\\nPettigrew, and Ron had to turn sideways to manage\\nit; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered with his wand.\\nHarry could see them edging awkwardly along the\\ntunnel in single file. Crookshanks was still in the\\nlead. Harry went right after Black, who was still\\nmaking Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept\\nbumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry\\nhad the impression Black was making no effort to\\nprevent this.\\n \\n“You know what this means?” Black said abruptly to\\nHarry as they made their slow progress along the\\ntunnel. “Turning Pettigrew in?”\\n“You’re free,” said Harry.\\n“Yes ... ,” said Black. “But I’m also — I don’t know if\\nanyone ever told you — I’m your godfather.”\\n“Yeah, I knew that,” said Harry.\\n“Well ... your parents appointed me your guardian,”\\nsaid Black stiffly. “If anything happened to them ...”\\nHarry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he\\nmeant?\\n“I’ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with\\nyour aunt and uncle,” said Black. “But ... well ...\\nthink about it. Once my name’s cleared ... if you\\nwanted a ... a different home ...”\\nSome sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry’s\\nstomach.\\n“What — live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking\\nhis head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling.\\n“Leave the Dursleys?”\\n“Of course, I thought you wouldn’t want to,” said\\nBlack quickly. “I understand, I just thought I’d — ”\\n“Are you insane?” said Harry, his voice easily as\\ncroaky as Black’s. “Of course I want to leave the\\nDursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move\\nin?”\\n \\nBlack turned right around to look at him; Snape’s\\nhead was scraping the ceiling but Black didn’t seem\\nto care.\\n“You want to?” he said. “You mean it?”\\n“Yeah, I mean it!” said Harry.\\nBlack’s gaunt face broke into the first true smile\\nHarry had seen upon it. The difference it made was\\nstartling, as though a person ten years younger were\\nshining through the starved mask; for a moment, he\\nwas recognizable as the man who had laughed at\\nHarry’s parents’ wedding.\\nThey did not speak again until they had reached the\\nend of the tunnel. Crookshanks darted up first; he\\nhad evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the\\ntrunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered\\nupward without any sound of savaging branches.\\nBlack saw Snape up through the hole, then stood\\nback for Harry and Hermione to pass. At last, all of\\nthem were out.\\nThe grounds were very dark now; the only light came\\nfrom the distant windows of the castle. Without a\\nword, they set off. Pettigrew was still wheezing and\\noccasionally whimpering. Harry’s mind was buzzing.\\nHe was going to leave the Dursleys. He was going to\\nlive with Sirius Black, his parents’ best friend. ... He\\nfelt dazed. ... What would happen when he told the\\nDursleys he was going to live with the convict they’d\\nseen on television... !\\n“One wrong move, Peter,” said Lupin threateningly\\nahead. His wand was still pointed sideways at\\nPettigrew’s chest.\\n \\nSilently they tramped through the grounds, the castle\\nlights growing slowly larger. Snape was still drifting\\nweirdly ahead of Black, his chin bumping on his\\nchest. And then —\\nA cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on\\nthe ground. Their party was bathed in moonlight.\\nSnape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who\\nhad stopped abruptly. Black froze. He flung out one\\narm to make Harry and Hermione stop.\\nHarry could see Lupin’s silhouette. He had gone rigid.\\nThen his limbs began to shake.\\n“Oh, my — ” Hermione gasped. “He didn’t take his\\npotion tonight! He’s not safe!”\\n“Run,” Black whispered. “Run. Now.”\\nBut Harry couldn’t run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew\\nand Lupin. He leapt forward but Black caught him\\naround the chest and threw him back.\\n“Leave it to me — RUN!”\\nThere was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin’s head was\\nlengthening. So was his body. His shoulders were\\nhunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and\\nhands, which were curling into clawed paws.\\nCrookshanks’s hair was on end again; he was backing\\naway —\\nAs the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius\\ndisappeared from Harry’s side. He had transformed.\\nThe enormous, bearlike dog bounded forward. As the\\nwerewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding\\nit, the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it\\n \\nbackward, away from Ron and Pettigrew. They were\\nlocked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other —\\nHarry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon\\nthe battle to notice anything else. It was Hermione’s\\nscream that alerted him —\\nPettigrew had dived for Lupin’s dropped wand. Ron,\\nunsteady on his bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang,\\na burst of light — and Ron lay motionless on the\\nground. Another bang — Crookshanks flew into the\\nair and back to the earth in a heap.\\n“ ExpelliarmusV’ Harry yelled, pointing his own wand\\nat Pettigrew; Lupin’s wand flew high into the air and\\nout of sight. “Stay where you are!” Harry shouted,\\nrunning forward.\\nToo late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his\\nbald tail whip through the manacle on Ron’s\\noutstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the\\ngrass.\\nThere was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned\\nto see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into\\nthe forest —\\n“Sirius, he’s gone, Pettigrew transformed!” Harry\\nyelled.\\nBlack was bleeding; there were gashes across his\\nmuzzle and back, but at Harry’s words he scrambled\\nup again, and in an instant, the sound of his paws\\nfaded to silence as he pounded away across the\\ngrounds.\\nHarry and Hermione dashed over to Ron.\\n \\n“What did he do to him?” Hermione whispered. Ron’s\\neyes were only half-closed, his mouth hung open; he\\nwas definitely alive, they could hear him breathing,\\nbut he didn’t seem to recognize them.\\n“I don’t know. ...”\\nHarry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin\\nboth gone . . . they had no one but Snape for company,\\nstill hanging, unconscious, in midair.\\n“We’d better get them up to the castle and tell\\nsomeone,” said Harry, pushing his hair out of his\\neyes, trying to think straight. Come — ”\\nBut then, from beyond the range of their vision, they\\nheard a yelping, a whining: a dog in pain. ...\\n“Sirius,” Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.\\nHe had a moment’s indecision, but there was nothing\\nthey could do for Ron at the moment, and by the\\nsound of it, Black was in trouble —\\nHarry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him.\\nThe yelping seemed to be coming from the ground\\nnear the edge of the lake. They pelted toward it, and\\nHarry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing\\nwhat it must mean —\\nThe yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the\\nlakeshore, they saw why — Sirius had turned back\\ninto a man. He was crouched on all fours, his hands\\nover his head.\\n“iVooo,” he moaned. “Noooo ... please. ...”\\nAnd then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a\\nhundred of them, gliding in a black mass around the\\n \\nlake toward them. He spun around, the familiar, icy\\ncold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure\\nhis vision; more were appearing out of the darkness\\non every side; they were encircling them. ...\\n“Hermione, think of something happy!” Harry yelled,\\nraising his wand, blinking furiously to try and clear\\nhis vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint\\nscreaming that had started inside it —\\nI’m going to live with my godfather. I’m leaving the\\nDursleys.\\nHe forced himself to think of Black, and only Black,\\nand began to chant: “Expecto patronum). Expecto\\npatronum).”\\nBlack gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless\\non the ground, pale as death.\\nHell be all right. I’m going to go and live with him.\\n“Expecto patronum). Hermione, help me! Expecto\\npatronum).”\\n“Expecto — ” Hermione whispered, “expecto — expecto\\nBut she couldn’t do it. The dementors were closing in,\\nbarely ten feet from them. They formed a solid wall\\naround Harry and Hermione, and were getting closer.\\n“EXPECTO PATRONUM” Harry yelled, trying to blot\\nthe screaming from his ears. “EXPECTO PATRONUM.”\\nA thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered\\nlike mist before him. At the same moment, Harry felt\\n \\nHermione collapse next to him. He was alone ...\\ncompletely alone. ...\\n“Expecto — expecto patronum — ”\\nHarry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was\\nclouding his eyes. With a huge effort, he fought to\\nremember — Sirius was innocent — innocent — We’ll\\nbe okay — I’m going to live with him —\\n“ Expecto patronum J” he gasped.\\nBy the feeble light of his formless Patronus, he saw a\\ndementor halt, very close to him. It couldn’t walk\\nthrough the cloud of silver mist Harry had conjured.\\nA dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It\\nmade a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus\\naside.\\n“No — no — ” Harry gasped. “He’s innocent ... expecto\\n— expecto patronum — ”\\nHe could feel them watching him, hear their rattling\\nbreath like an evil wind around him. The nearest\\ndementor seemed to be considering him. Then it\\nraised both its rotting hands — and lowered its hood.\\nWhere there should have been eyes, there was only\\nthin, gray scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty\\nsockets. But there was a mouth ... a gaping,\\nshapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a\\ndeath rattle.\\nA paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn’t\\nmove or speak. His Patronus flickered and died.\\nWhite fog was blinding him. He had to fight ... expecto\\npatronum ... he couldn’t see ... and in the distance, he\\nheard the familiar screaming . . . expecto patronum . . .\\n \\nhe groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his arm ...\\nthey weren’t going to take him. ...\\nBut a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly\\nattached themselves around Harry’s neck. They were\\nforcing his face upward. ... He could feel its breath. ...\\nIt was going to get rid of him first. ... He could feel its\\nputrid breath. . . . His mother was screaming in his\\nears. ... She was going to be the last thing he ever\\nheard —\\nAnd then, through the fog that was drowning him, he\\nthought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and\\nbrighter. ... He felt himself fall forward onto the grass.\\n... Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking,\\nHarry opened his eyes. The dementor must have\\nreleased him. The blinding light was illuminating the\\ngrass around him. ... The screaming had stopped, the\\ncold was ebbing away. . . .\\nSomething was driving the dementors back. ... It was\\ncircling around him and Black and Hermione. ... They\\nwere leaving. ... The air was warm again. ...\\nWith every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry\\nraised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid\\nthe light, galloping away across the lake. ... Eyes\\nblurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it\\nwas. ... It was as bright as a unicorn. ... Fighting to\\nstay conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it\\nreached the opposite shore. For a moment, Harry\\nsaw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back\\n. . . raising his hand to pat it . . . someone who looked\\nstrangely familiar ... but it couldn’t be ...\\nHarry didn’t understand. He couldn’t think anymore.\\nHe felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head\\nhit the ground as he fainted.\\n \\nHERMIONE’S SECRET\\n“Shocking business ... shocking ... miracle none of\\nthem died . . . never heard the like ... by thunder, it\\nwas lucky you were there, Snape. ...”\\n“Thank you, Minister.”\\n“Order of Merlin, Second Class, I’d say. First Class, if\\nI can wangle it!”\\n“Thank you very much indeed, Minister.”\\n“Nasty cut you’ve got there. ... Black’s work, I\\nsuppose?”\\n“As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and\\nGranger, Minister. ...”\\n“iVo!”\\n“Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A\\nConfundus Charm, to judge by their behavior. They\\nseemed to think there was a possibility he was\\n \\ninnocent. They weren’t responsible for their actions.\\nOn the other hand, their interference might have\\npermitted Black to escape. ... They obviously thought\\nthey were going to catch Black single-handed. They’ve\\ngot away with a great deal before now. ... I’m afraid\\nit’s given them a rather high opinion of themselves ...\\nand of course Potter has always been allowed an\\nextraordinary amount of license by the headmaster —\\n“Ah, well, Snape ... Harry Potter, you know ... we’ve\\nall got a bit of a blind spot where he’s concerned.”\\n“And yet — is it good for him to be given so much\\nspecial treatment? Personally, I try and treat him like\\nany other student. And any other student would be\\nsuspended — at the very least — for leading his\\nfriends into such danger. Consider, Minister —\\nagainst all school rules — after all the precautions\\nput in place for his protection — out-of-bounds, at\\nnight, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer —\\nand I have reason to believe he has been visiting\\nHogsmeade illegally too — ”\\n“Well, well ... we shall see, Snape, we shall see. ... The\\nboy has undoubtedly been foolish. ...”\\nHarry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt\\nvery groggy. The words he was hearing seemed to be\\ntraveling very slowly from his ears to his brain, so\\nthat it was difficult to understand. ... His limbs felt\\nlike lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift. ... He wanted to\\nlie here, on this comfortable bed, forever. ...\\n“What amazes me most is the behavior of the\\ndementors ... you’ve really no idea what made them\\nretreat, Snape?”\\n \\n“No, Minister ... by the time I had come ’round they\\nwere heading back to their positions at the entrances.\\n“Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl\\n“All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound\\nand gagged Black, naturally, conjured stretchers, and\\nbrought them all straight back to the castle.”\\nThere was a pause. Harry’s brain seemed to be\\nmoving a little faster, and as it did, a gnawing\\nsensation grew in the pit of his stomach. ...\\nHe opened his eyes.\\nEverything was slightly blurred. Somebody had\\nremoved his glasses. He was lying in the dark hospital\\nwing. At the very end of the ward, he could make out\\nMadam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a\\nbed. Harry squinted. Ron’s red hair was visible\\nbeneath Madam Pomfrey’s arm.\\nHarry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed\\nto his right lay Hermione. Moonlight was falling\\nacross her bed. Her eyes were open too. She looked\\npetrified, and when she saw that Harry was awake,\\npressed a finger to her lips, then pointed to the\\nhospital wing door. It was ajar, and the voices of\\nCornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it\\nfrom the corridor outside.\\nMadam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the\\ndark ward to Harry’s bed. He turned to look at her.\\nShe was carrying the largest block of chocolate he\\nhad ever seen in his life. It looked like a small\\nboulder.\\n \\n“Ah, you’re awake!” she said briskly. She placed the\\nchocolate on Harry’s bedside table and began\\nbreaking it apart with a small hammer.\\n“How’s Ron?” said Harry and Hermione together.\\n“He’ll live,” said Madam Pomfrey grimly. “As for you\\ntwo ... you’ll be staying here until I’m satisfied you’re\\n— Potter, what do you think you’re doing?”\\nHarry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and\\npicking up his wand.\\n“I need to see the headmaster,” he said.\\n“Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, “it’s all\\nright. They’ve got Black. He’s locked away upstairs.\\nThe dementors will be performing the kiss any\\nmoment now — ”\\n“WHAT?”\\nHarry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the\\nsame. But his shout had been heard in the corridor\\noutside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and Snape had\\nentered the ward.\\n“Harry, Harry, what’s this?” said Fudge, looking\\nagitated. “You should be in bed — has he had any\\nchocolate?” he asked Madam Pomfrey anxiously.\\n“Minister, listen!” Harry said. “Sirius Black’s innocent!\\nPeter Pettigrew faked his own death! We saw him\\ntonight! You can’t let the dementors do that thing to\\nSirius, he’s — ”\\nBut Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile\\non his face.\\n \\n“Harry, Harry, you’re very confused, you’ve been\\nthrough a dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now, we’ve\\ngot everything under control. ...”\\n“YOU HAVEN’T!” Harry yelled. “YOU VE GOT THE\\nWRONG MAN!”\\n“Minister, listen, please,” Hermione said; she had\\nhurried to Harry’s side and was gazing imploringly\\ninto Fudge’s face. “I saw him too. It was Ron’s rat,\\nhe’s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and — ”\\n“You see, Minister?” said Snape. “Confunded, both of\\nthem. ... Black’s done a very good job on them. ...”\\n“WE’RE NOT CONFUNDED!” Harry roared.\\n“Minister! Professor!” said Madam Pomfrey angrily. “I\\nmust insist that you leave. Potter is my patient, and\\nhe should not be distressed!”\\n“I’m not distressed, I’m trying to tell them what\\nhappened!” Harry said furiously. “If they’d just listen\\nBut Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk\\nof chocolate into Harry’s mouth; he choked, and she\\nseized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed.\\n“Now, please, Minister, these children need care.\\nPlease leave — ”\\nThe door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry\\nswallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great\\ndifficulty and got up again.\\n“Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black — ”\\n \\n“For heaven’s sake!” said Madam Pomfrey\\nhysterically. “Is this a hospital wing or not?\\nHeadmaster, I must insist — ”\\n“My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr.\\nPotter and Miss Granger,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I\\nhave just been talking to Sirius Black — ”\\n“I suppose he’s told you the same fairy tale he’s\\nplanted in Potter’s mind?” spat Snape. “Something\\nabout a rat, and Pettigrew being alive — ”\\n“That, indeed, is Black’s story,” said Dumbledore,\\nsurveying Snape closely through his half-moon\\nspectacles.\\n“And does my evidence count for nothing?” snarled\\nSnape. “Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking\\nShack, nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds.”\\n“That was because you were knocked out, Professor!”\\nsaid Hermione earnestly. “You didn’t arrive in time to\\nhear — ”\\n“Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!”\\n“Now, Snape,” said Fudge, startled, “the young lady is\\ndisturbed in her mind, we must make allowances — ”\\n“I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,”\\nsaid Dumbledore abruptly. “Cornelius, Severus,\\nPoppy — please leave us.”\\n“Headmaster!” sputtered Madam Pomfrey “They need\\ntreatment, they need rest — ”\\n“This cannot wait,” said Dumbledore. “I must insist.”\\n \\nMadam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into\\nher office at the end of the ward, slamming the door\\nbehind her. Fudge consulted the large gold pocket\\nwatch dangling from his waistcoat.\\n“The dementors should have arrived by now,” he said.\\n“Ill go and meet them. Dumbledore, 111 see you\\nupstairs.”\\nHe crossed to the door and held it open for Snape,\\nbut Snape hadn’t moved.\\n“You surely don’t believe a word of Black’s story?”\\nSnape whispered, his eyes fixed on Dumbledore ’s\\nface.\\n“I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,”\\nDumbledore repeated.\\nSnape took a step toward Dumbledore.\\n“Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the\\nage of sixteen,” he breathed. “You haven’t forgotten\\nthat, Headmaster? You haven’t forgotten that he once\\ntried to kill me?”\\n“My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,” said\\nDumbledore quietly.\\nSnape turned on his heel and marched through the\\ndoor Fudge was still holding. It closed behind them,\\nand Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione. They\\nboth burst into speech at the same time.\\n“Professor, Black’s telling the truth — we saw\\nPettigrew — ”\\n“ — he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a\\nwerewolf — ”\\n \\n“ — he’s a rat — ”\\n“ — Pettigrew’s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off\\n“ — Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn’t Sirius — ”\\nBut Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of\\nexplanations.\\n“It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not\\ninterrupt me, because there is very little time,” he\\nsaid quietly. “There is not a shred of proof to support\\nBlack’s story, except your word — and the word of\\ntwo thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince\\nanybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw\\nSirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the\\nMinistry that Sirius had been the Potters’ Secret-\\nKeeper.”\\n“Professor Lupin can tell you — ” Harry said, unable to\\nstop himself.\\n“Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest,\\nunable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is\\nhuman again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse\\nthan dead. I might add that werewolves are so\\nmistrusted by most of our kind that his support will\\ncount for very little — and the fact that he and Sirius\\nare old friends — ”\\n“But — ”\\n“ Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand\\nme? You must see that Professor Snape’s version of\\nevents is far more convincing than yours.”\\n“He hates Sirius,” Hermione said desperately. “All\\nbecause of some stupid trick Sirius played on him — ”\\n \\n“Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The\\nattack on the Fat Lady — entering Gryffindor Tower\\nwith a knife — without Pettigrew, alive or dead, we\\nhave no chance of overturning Sirius’s sentence.”\\n“But you believe us.”\\n“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore quietly. “But I have no\\npower to make other men see the truth, or to overrule\\nthe Minister of Magic. ...”\\nHarry stared up into the grave face and felt as though\\nthe ground beneath him were falling sharply away. He\\nhad grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could\\nsolve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull\\nsome amazing solution out of the air. But no . . . their\\nlast hope was gone.\\n“What we need,” said Dumbledore slowly, and his\\nlight blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione, “is\\nmore time.”\\n“But — ” Hermione began. And then her eyes became\\nvery round. “OH!”\\n“Now, pay attention,” said Dumbledore, speaking very\\nlow, and very clearly. “Sirius is locked in Professor\\nFlitwick’s office on the seventh floor. Thirteenth\\nwindow from the right of the West Tower. If all goes\\nwell, you will be able to save more than one innocent\\nlife tonight. But remember this, both of you: you must\\nnot be seen. Miss Granger, you know the law — you\\nknow what is at stake. ... You — must — not — be —\\nseen.”\\nHarry didn’t have a clue what was going on.\\nDumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back\\nas he reached the door.\\n \\n“I am going to lock you in. It is — ” he consulted his\\nwatch, “five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three\\nturns should do it. Good luck.”\\n“Good luck?” Harry repeated as the door closed\\nbehind Dumbledore. “Three turns? What’s he talking\\nabout? What are we supposed to do?”\\nBut Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her\\nrobes, pulling from beneath them a very long, very\\nfine gold chain.\\n“Harry, come here,” she said urgently. “Quick).”\\nHarry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She\\nwas holding the chain out. He saw a tiny, sparkling\\nhourglass hanging from it.\\n“Here — ”\\nShe had thrown the chain around his neck too.\\n“Ready?” she said breathlessly.\\n“What are we doing?” Harry said, completely lost.\\nHermione turned the hourglass over three times.\\nThe dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation\\nthat he was flying very fast, backward. A blur of\\ncolors and shapes rushed past him, his ears were\\npounding, he tried to yell but couldn’t hear his own\\nvoice —\\nAnd then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and\\neverything came into focus again —\\nHe was standing next to Hermione in the deserted\\nentrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was\\n \\nfalling across the paved floor from the open front\\ndoors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the\\nchain of the hourglass cutting into his neck.\\n“Hermione, what — ?”\\n“In here!” Hermione seized Harry’s arm and dragged\\nhim across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she\\nopened it, pushed him inside among the buckets and\\nmops, then slammed the door behind them.\\n“What — how — Hermione, what happened?”\\n“We’ve gone back in time,” Hermione whispered,\\nlifting the chain off Harry’s neck in the darkness.\\n“Three hours back ...”\\nHarry found his own leg and gave it a very hard\\npinch. It hurt a lot, which seemed to rule out the\\npossibility that he was having a very bizarre dream.\\n“But — ”\\n“Shh! Listen! Someone’s coming! I think — I think it\\nmight be us!”\\nHermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard\\ndoor.\\n“Footsteps across the hall ... yes, I think it’s us going\\ndown to Hagrid’s!”\\n“Are you telling me,” Harry whispered, “that we’re\\nhere in this cupboard and we’re out there too?”\\n“Yes,” said Hermione, her ear still glued to the\\ncupboard door. “I’m sure it’s us. It doesn’t sound like\\nmore than three people ... and we’re walking slowly\\nbecause we’re under the Invisibility Cloak — ”\\n \\nShe broke off, still listening intently.\\n“We’ve gone down the front steps. ...”\\nHermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking\\ndesperately anxious, but Harry wanted a few\\nquestions answered.\\n“Where did you get that hourglass thing?”\\n“It’s called a Time-Turner,” Hermione whispered, “and\\nI got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day\\nback. I’ve been using it all year to get to all my\\nlessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I\\nwouldn’t tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of\\nletters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one.\\nShe had to tell them that I was a model student, and\\nthat I’d never, ever use it for anything except my\\nstudies. ... I’ve been turning it back so I could do\\nhours over again, that’s how I’ve been doing several\\nlessons at once, see? But ...\\n“Harry, I don’t understand what Dumbledore wants us\\nto do. Why did he tell us to go back three hours?\\nHow’s that going to help Sirius?”\\nHarry stared at her shadowy face.\\n“There must be something that happened around now\\nhe wants us to change,” he said slowly. “What\\nhappened? We were walking down to Hagrid’s three\\nhours ago. ...”\\n“This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to\\nHagrid’s,” said Hermione. “We just heard ourselves\\nleaving. ...”\\nHarry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up\\nhis whole brain in concentration.\\n \\n“Dumbledore just said — just said we could save\\nmore than one innocent life. ...” And then it hit him.\\n“Hermione, we’re going to save Buckbeak!”\\n“But — how will that help Sirius?”\\n“Dumbledore said — he just told us where the\\nwindow is — the window of Flitwick’s office! Where\\nthey’ve got Sirius locked up! We’ve got to fly\\nBuckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius\\ncan escape on Buckbeak — they can escape together!”\\nFrom what Harry could see of Hermione’s face, she\\nlooked terrified.\\n“If we manage that without being seen, it’ll be a\\nmiracle!”\\n“Well, we’ve got to try, haven’t we?” said Harry. He\\nstood up and pressed his ear against the door.\\n“Doesn’t sound like anyone’s there. ... Come on, let’s\\ngo. ...”\\nHarry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall\\nwas deserted. As quietly and quickly as they could,\\nthey darted out of the closet and down the stone\\nsteps. The shadows were already lengthening, the\\ntops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once\\nmore with gold.\\n“If anyone’s looking out of the window — ” Hermione\\nsqueaked, looking up at the castle behind them.\\n“Well run for it,” said Harry determinedly. “Straight\\ninto the forest, all right? We’ll have to hide behind a\\ntree or something and keep a lookout — ”\\n \\n“Okay, but well go around by the greenhouses!” said\\nHermione breathlessly. “We need to keep out of sight\\nof Hagrid’s front door, or well see us! We must be\\nnearly at Hagrid’s by now!”\\nStill working out what she meant, Harry set off at a\\nsprint, Hermione behind him. They tore across the\\nvegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a\\nmoment behind them, then set off again, fast as they\\ncould, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing\\ntoward the shelter of the forest. ...\\nSafe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned\\naround; seconds later, Hermione arrived beside him,\\npanting.\\n“Right,” she gasped. “We need to sneak over to\\nHagrid’s. ... Keep out of sight, Harry. ...”\\nThey made their way silently through the trees,\\nkeeping to the very edge of the forest. Then, as they\\nglimpsed the front of Hagrid’s house, they heard a\\nknock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a\\nwide oak trunk and peered out from either side.\\nHagrid had appeared in his doorway, shaking and\\nwhite, looking around to see who had knocked. And\\nHarry heard his own voice.\\n“It’s us. We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in\\nand we can take it off.”\\n“Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered. He stood\\nback, then shut the door quickly.\\n“This is the weirdest thing we’ve ever done,” Harry\\nsaid fervently.\\n“Let’s move along a bit,” Hermione whispered. “We\\nneed to get nearer to Buckbeak!”\\n \\nThey crept through the trees until they saw the\\nnervous hippogriff, tethered to the fence around\\nHagrid’s pumpkin patch.\\n“Now?” Harry whispered.\\n“No!” said Hermione. “If we steal him now, those\\nCommittee people will think Hagrid set him free!\\nWe’ve got to wait until they’ve seen he’s tied outside!”\\n“That’s going to give us about sixty seconds,” said\\nHarry. This was starting to seem impossible.\\nAt that moment, there was a crash of breaking china\\nfrom inside Hagrid’s cabin.\\n“That’s Hagrid breaking the milk jug,” Hermione\\nwhispered. “I’m going to find Scabbers in a moment —\\nSure enough, a few minutes later, they heard\\nHermione ’s shriek of surprise.\\n“Hermione,” said Harry suddenly, “what if we — we\\njust run in there and grab Pettigrew — ”\\n“No!” said Hermione in a terrified whisper. “Don’t you\\nunderstand? We’re breaking one of the most\\nimportant wizarding laws! Nobody’s supposed to\\nchange time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we’re\\nseen — ”\\n“We’d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!”\\n“Harry, what do you think you’d do if you saw\\nyourself bursting into Hagrid’s house?” said\\nHermione.\\n \\n“I’d — I’d think I’d gone mad,” said Harry, “or I’d think\\nthere was some Dark Magic going on — ”\\n“ Exactly ! You wouldn’t understand, you might even\\nattack yourself! Don’t you see? Professor McGonagall\\ntold me what awful things have happened when\\nwizards have meddled with time. ... Loads of them\\nended up killing their past or future selves by\\nmistake!”\\n“Okay!” said Harry. “It was just an idea, I just thought\\nBut Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the\\ncastle. Harry moved his head a few inches to get a\\nclear view of the distant front doors. Dumbledore,\\nFudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the\\nexecutioner were coming down the steps.\\n“We’re about to come out!” Hermione breathed.\\nAnd sure enough, moments later, Hagrid’s back door\\nopened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Hermione\\nwalking out of it with Hagrid. It was, without a doubt,\\nthe strangest sensation of his life, standing behind\\nthe tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.\\n“It’s okay, Beaky, it’s okay ... ,” Hagrid said to\\nBuckbeak. Then he turned to Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione. “Go on. Get goin’.”\\n“Hagrid, we can’t — ”\\n“Well tell them what really happened — ”\\n“They can’t kill him — ”\\n“Go! It’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an’\\nall!”\\n \\nHarry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch\\nthrow the Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron.\\n“Go quick. Don’ listen. ...”\\nThere was a knock on Hagrid’s front door. The\\nexecution party had arrived. Hagrid turned around\\nand headed back into his cabin, leaving the back door\\najar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all\\naround the cabin and heard three pairs of feet\\nretreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had gone ... but\\nthe Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could\\nnow hear what was happening inside the cabin\\nthrough the back door.\\n“Where is the beast?” came the cold voice of Macnair.\\n“Out — outside,” Hagrid croaked.\\nHarry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair’s face\\nappeared at Hagrid’s window, staring out at\\nBuckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.\\n“We — er — have to read you the official notice of\\nexecution, Hagrid. I’ll make it quick. And then you\\nand Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, you’re\\nsupposed to listen too, that’s procedure — ”\\nMacnair’s face vanished from the window. It was now\\nor never.\\n“Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.”\\nAs Fudge’s voice started again, Harry darted out from\\nbehind his tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin\\npatch, and approached Buckbeak.\\n“It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of\\nDangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak,\\n \\nhereafter called the condemned, shall be executed on\\nthe sixth of June at sundown — ”\\nCareful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s\\nfierce orange eyes once more and bowed. Buckbeak\\nsank to his scaly knees and then stood up again.\\nHarry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying\\nBuckbeak to the fence.\\n\"... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried\\nout by the Committee’s appointed executioner, Walden\\nMacnair ...”\\n“Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on,\\nwe’re going to help you. Quietly ... quietly ...”\\n\"... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here. ...”\\nHarry threw all his weight onto the rope, but\\nBuckbeak had dug in his front feet.\\n“Well, let’s get this over with,” said the reedy voice of\\nthe Committee member from inside Hagrid’s cabin.\\n“Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you stay inside — ”\\n“No, I — I wan’ ter be with him. ... I don’ wan’ him ter\\nbe alone — ”\\nFootsteps echoed from within the cabin.\\n“Buckbeak, move\\\\” Harry hissed.\\nHarry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak’s\\nneck. The hippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings\\nirritably. They were still ten feet away from the forest,\\nin plain view of Hagrid’s back door.\\n“One moment, please, Macnair,” came Dumbledore’s\\nvoice. “You need to sign too.” The footsteps stopped.\\n \\nHarry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his\\nbeak and walked a little faster.\\nHermione ’s white face was sticking out from behind a\\ntree.\\n“Harry, hurry!” she mouthed.\\nHarry could still hear Dumbledore’s voice talking from\\nwithin the cabin. He gave the rope another wrench.\\nBuckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They had\\nreached the trees. ...\\n“Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from\\nbehind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her\\nweight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked\\nover his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight;\\nthey couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.\\n“Stop!” he whispered to Hermione. “They might hear\\nus — ”\\nHagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry,\\nHermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the\\nhippogriff seemed to be listening intently.\\nSilence . . . then —\\n“Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee\\nmember. “Where is the beast?”\\n“It was tied here!” said the executioner furiously. “I\\nsaw it! Just here!”\\n“How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore. There was a\\nnote of amusement in his voice.\\n“Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily.\\n \\nThere was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe.\\nThe executioner seemed to have swung it into the\\nfence in anger. And then came the howling, and this\\ntime they could hear Hagrid ’s words through his sobs.\\n“Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he’s gone\\\\ Musta\\npulled himself free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!”\\nBuckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to\\nget back to Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened\\ntheir grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to\\nstop him.\\n“Someone untied him!” the executioner was snarling.\\n“We should search the grounds, the forest — ”\\n“Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you\\nreally think the thief will have led him away on foot?”\\nsaid Dumbledore, still sounding amused. “Search the\\nskies, if you will. ... Hagrid, I could do with a cup of\\ntea. Or a large brandy.”\\n“O’ — o’ course, Professor,” said Hagrid, who sounded\\nweak with happiness. “Come in, come in. ...”\\nHarry and Hermione listened closely. They heard\\nfootsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner, the\\nsnap of the door, and then silence once more.\\n“Now what?” whispered Harry, looking around.\\n“Well have to hide in here,” said Hermione, who\\nlooked very shaken. “We need to wait until they’ve\\ngone back to the castle. Then we wait until it’s safe to\\nfly Buckbeak up to Sirius’s window. He won’t be there\\nfor another couple of hours. ... Oh, this is going to be\\ndifficult. ...”\\n \\nShe looked nervously over her shoulder into the\\ndepths of the forest. The sun was setting now.\\n“We’re going to have to move,” said Harry, thinking\\nhard. “We’ve got to be able to see the Whomping\\nWillow, or we won’t know what’s going on.”\\n“Okay,” said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on\\nBuckbeak’s rope. “But we’ve got to keep out of sight,\\nHarry, remember. ...”\\nThey moved around the edge of the forest, darkness\\nfalling thickly around them, until they were hidden\\nbehind a clump of trees through which they could\\nmake out the Willow.\\n“There’s Ron!” said Harry suddenly.\\nA dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its\\nshout echoed through the still night air.\\n“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come\\nhere — ”\\nAnd then they saw two more figures materialize out of\\nnowhere. Harry watched himself and Hermione\\nchasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.\\n“Gotchcd Get off, you stinking cat — ”\\n“There’s Sirius!” said Harry. The great shape of the\\ndog had bounded out from the roots of the Willow.\\nThey saw him bowl Harry over, then seize Ron. ...\\n“Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it?” said Harry,\\nwatching the dog pulling Ron into the roots. “Ouch —\\nlook, I just got walloped by the tree — and so did you\\n— this is weird — ”\\n \\nThe Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out\\nwith its lower branches; they could see themselves\\ndarting here and there, trying to reach the trunk. And\\nthen the tree froze.\\n“That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,” said\\nHermione.\\n“And there we go ... ,” Harry muttered. “We’re in.”\\nThe moment they disappeared, the tree began to move\\nagain. Seconds later, they heard footsteps quite close\\nby. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and the old\\nCommittee member were making their way up to the\\ncastle.\\n“Right after we’d gone down into the passage!” said\\nHermione. “If only Dumbledore had come with us ...”\\n“Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said Harry\\nbitterly. “I bet you anything Fudge would’ve told\\nMacnair to murder Sirius on the spot. ...”\\nThey watched the four men climb the castle steps and\\ndisappear from view. For a few minutes the scene was\\ndeserted. Then —\\n“Here comes Lupin!” said Harry as they saw another\\nfigure sprinting down the stone steps and haring\\ntoward the Willow. Harry looked up at the sky. Clouds\\nwere obscuring the moon completely.\\nThey watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the\\nground and prod the knot on the trunk. The tree\\nstopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the\\ngap in its roots.\\n“If he’d only grabbed the cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just\\nlying there. ...”\\n \\nHe turned to Hermione.\\n“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape’d\\nnever be able to get it and — ”\\n“Harry, we mustn’t be seen!”\\n“How can you stand this?” he asked Hermione\\nfiercely. “Just standing here and watching it happen?”\\nHe hesitated. “I’m going to grab the cloak!”\\n“Harry, no!”\\nHermione seized the back of Harry’s robes not a\\nmoment too soon. Just then, they heard a burst of\\nsong. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the castle,\\nsinging at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as\\nhe walked. A large bottle was swinging from his\\nhands.\\n“See?” Hermione whispered. “See what would have\\nhappened? We’ve got to keep out of sight! No,\\nBuckbeak).”\\nThe hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to\\nHagrid again; Harry seized his rope too, straining to\\nhold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid meander\\ntipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak\\nstopped fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.\\nBarely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open\\nyet again, and Snape came charging out of them,\\nrunning toward the Willow.\\nHarry’s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to\\na halt next to the tree, looking around. He grabbed\\nthe cloak and held it up.\\n \\n“Get your filthy hands off it,” Harry snarled under his\\nbreath.\\n“Shh!”\\nSnape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the\\ntree, prodded the knot, and vanished from view as he\\nput on the cloak.\\n“So that’s it,” said Hermione quietly. “We’re all down\\nthere ... and now we’ve just got to wait until we come\\nback up again. ...”\\nShe took the end of Buckbeak’s rope and tied it\\nsecurely around the nearest tree, then sat down on\\nthe dry ground, arms around her knees.\\n“Harry, there’s something I don’t understand. ... Why\\ndidn’t the dementors get Sirius? I remember them\\ncoming, and then I think I passed out . . . there were\\nso many of them. ...”\\nHarry sat down too. He explained what he’d seen;\\nhow, as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth\\nto Harry’s, a large silver something had come\\ngalloping across the lake and forced the dementors to\\nretreat.\\nHermione ’s mouth was slightly open by the time\\nHarry had finished.\\n“But what was it?”\\n“There’s only one thing it could have been, to make\\nthe dementors go,” said Harry. “A real Patronus. A\\npowerful one.”\\n“But who conjured it?”\\n \\nHarry didn’t say anything. He was thinking back to\\nthe person he’d seen on the other bank of the lake. He\\nknew who he thought it had been . . . but how could it\\nhave been?\\n“Didn’t you see what they looked like?” said Hermione\\neagerly. “Was it one of the teachers?”\\n“No,” said Harry. “He wasn’t a teacher.”\\n“But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to\\ndrive all those dementors away. ... If the Patronus\\nwas shining so brightly, didn’t it light him up?\\nCouldn’t you see — ?”\\n“Yeah, I saw him,” said Harry slowly. “But ... maybe I\\nimagined it. ... I wasn’t thinking straight. ... I passed\\nout right afterward. ...”\\n“ Who did you think it was?”\\n“I think — ” Harry swallowed, knowing how strange\\nthis was going to sound. “I think it was my dad.”\\nHarry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her\\nmouth was fully open now. She was gazing at him\\nwith a mixture of alarm and pity.\\n“Harry, your dad’s — well — dead,” she said quietly.\\n“I know that,” said Harry quickly.\\n“You think you saw his ghost?”\\n“I don’t know ... no ... he looked solid. ...”\\n“But then — ”\\n \\n“Maybe I was seeing things,” said Harry. “But ... from\\nwhat I could see ... it looked like him. ... I’ve got\\nphotos of him. ...”\\nHermione was still looking at him as though worried\\nabout his sanity.\\n“I know it sounds crazy,” said Harry flatly. He turned\\nto look at Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into\\nthe ground, apparently searching for worms. But he\\nwasn’t really watching Buckbeak.\\nHe was thinking about his father and about his\\nfather’s three oldest friends ... Moony, Wormtail,\\nPadfoot, and Prongs. ... Had all four of them been out\\non the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared\\nthis evening when everyone had thought he was dead.\\n... Was it so impossible his father had done the same?\\nHad he been seeing things across the lake? The figure\\nhad been too far away to see distinctly . . . yet he had\\nfelt sure, for a moment, before he’d lost\\nconsciousness. ...\\nThe leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The\\nmoon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting\\nclouds. Hermione sat with her face turned toward the\\nWillow, waiting.\\nAnd then, at last, after over an hour . . .\\n“Here we come!” Hermione whispered.\\nShe and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his\\nhead. They saw Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambering\\nawkwardly out of the hole in the roots . . . followed by\\nthe unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next\\ncame Harry, Hermione, and Black. They all began to\\nwalk toward the castle.\\n \\nHarry’s heart was starting to beat very fast. He\\nglanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud\\nwas going to move aside and show the moon. ...\\n“Harry,” Hermione muttered as though she knew\\nexactly what he was thinking, “we’ve got to stay put.\\nWe mustn’t be seen. There’s nothing we can do. ...”\\n“So we’re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over\\nagain. ...” said Harry quietly.\\n“How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?”\\nsnapped Hermione. “There’s nothing we can do! We\\ncame back to help Sirius; we’re not supposed to be\\ndoing anything else!”\\n“ All right\\'.”\\nThe moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw\\nthe tiny figures across the grounds stop. Then they\\nsaw movement —\\n“There goes Lupin,” Hermione whispered. “He’s\\ntransforming — ”\\n“Hermione!” said Harry suddenly. “We’ve got to move!”\\n“We mustn’t, I keep telling you — ”\\n“Not to interfere! Lupin’s going to run into the forest,\\nright at us!”\\nHermione gasped.\\n“Quick!” she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak.\\n“Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going\\nto hide? The dementors will be coming any moment —\\n \\n“Back to Hagrid’s!” Harry said. “It’s empty now —\\ncome on!”\\nThey ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering\\nalong behind them. They could hear the werewolf\\nhowling behind them. ...\\nThe cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door,\\nwrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak\\nflashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them\\nand bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked\\nloudly.\\n“Shh, Fang, it’s us!” said Hermione, hurrying over and\\nscratching his ears to quieten him. “That was really\\nclose!” she said to Harry.\\n“Yeah ...”\\nHarry was looking out of the window. It was much\\nharder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak\\nseemed very happy to find himself back inside\\nHagrid’s house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded\\nhis wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good\\nnap.\\n“I think I’d better go outside again, you know,” said\\nHarry slowly. “I can’t see what’s going on — we won’t\\nknow when it’s time — ”\\nHermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.\\n“I’m not going to try and interfere,” said Harry\\nquickly. “But if we don’t see what’s going on, how’re\\nwe going to know when it’s time to rescue Sirius?”\\n“Well ... okay, then ... I’ll wait here with Buckbeak ...\\nbut Harry, be careful — there’s a werewolf out there\\n— and the dementors — ”\\n \\nHarry stepped outside again and edged around the\\ncabin. He could hear yelping in the distance. That\\nmeant the dementors were closing in on Sirius. ... He\\nand Hermione would be running to him any moment.\\nHarry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a\\nkind of drumroll in his chest. ... Whoever had sent\\nthat Patronus would be appearing at any moment. ...\\nFor a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front\\nof Hagrid’s door. You must not be seen. But he didn’t\\nwant to be seen. He wanted to do the seeing. ... He\\nhad to know. . . .\\nAnd there were the dementors. They were emerging\\nout of the darkness from every direction, gliding\\naround the edges of the lake. ... They were moving\\naway from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank.\\n... He wouldn’t have to get near them. ...\\nHarry began to run. He had no thought in his head\\nexcept his father. ... If it was him ... if it really was\\nhim ... he had to know, had to find out. ...\\nThe lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there\\nwas no sign of anybody. On the opposite bank, he\\ncould see tiny glimmers of silver — his own attempts\\nat a Patronus —\\nThere was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry\\nthrew himself behind it, peering desperately through\\nthe leaves. On the opposite bank, the glimmers of\\nsilver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified\\nexcitement shot through him — any moment now —\\n“Come on!” he muttered, staring about. “Where are\\nyou? Dad, come on — ”\\n \\nBut no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the\\ncircle of dementors across the lake. One of them was\\nlowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to\\nappear — but no one was coming to help this time —\\nAnd then it hit him — he understood. He hadn’t seen\\nhis father — he had seen himself —\\nHarry flung himself out from behind the bush and\\npulled out his wand.\\n“EXPECTO PATRONUM ” he yelled.\\nAnd out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless\\ncloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal.\\nHe screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was. It\\nlooked like a horse. It was galloping silently away\\nfrom him, across the black surface of the lake. He\\nsaw it lower its head and charge at the swarming\\ndementors. ... Now it was galloping around and\\naround the black shapes on the ground, and the\\ndementors were falling back, scattering, retreating\\ninto the darkness. ... They were gone.\\nThe Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward\\nHarry across the still surface of the water. It wasn’t a\\nhorse. It wasn’t a unicorn, either. It was a stag. It was\\nshining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming\\nback to him. ...\\nIt stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on\\nthe soft ground as it stared at Harry with its large,\\nsilver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its antlered head. And\\nHarry realized . . .\\n“Prongs,” he whispered.\\nBut as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the\\ncreature, it vanished.\\n \\nHarry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with\\na great leap of his heart, he heard hooves behind him\\n— he whirled around and saw Hermione dashing\\ntoward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her.\\n“What did you do?” she said fiercely. “You said you\\nwere only going to keep a lookout!”\\n“I just saved all our lives ... ,” said Harry. “Get behind\\nhere — behind this bush — I’ll explain.”\\nHermione listened to what had just happened with\\nher mouth open yet again.\\n“Did anyone see you?”\\n“Yes, haven’t you been listening? I saw me but I\\nthought I was my dad! It’s okay!”\\n“Harry, I can’t believe it. ... You conjured up a\\nPatronus that drove away all those dementors! That’s\\nvery, very advanced magic. ...”\\n“I knew I could do it this time,” said Harry, “because\\nI’d already done it. ... Does that make sense?”\\n“I don’t know — Harry, look at Snape!”\\nTogether they peered around the bush at the other\\nbank. Snape had regained consciousness. He was\\nconjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of\\nHarry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth\\nstretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating\\nat his side. Then, wand held out in front of him, he\\nmoved them away toward the castle.\\n“Right, it’s nearly time,” said Hermione tensely,\\nlooking at her watch. “We’ve got about forty-five\\nminutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the\\n \\nhospital wing. We’ve got to rescue Sirius and get back\\ninto the ward before anybody realizes we’re missing.\\nThey waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in\\nthe lake, while the bush next to them whispered in\\nthe breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms\\nagain.\\n“D’you reckon he’s up there yet?” said Harry,\\nchecking his watch. He looked up at the castle and\\nbegan counting the windows to the right of the West\\nTower.\\n“Look!” Hermione whispered. “Who’s that? Someone’s\\ncoming back out of the castle!”\\nHarry stared through the darkness. The man was\\nhurrying across the grounds, toward one of the\\nentrances. Something shiny glinted in his belt.\\n“Macnair!” said Harry. “The executioner! He’s gone to\\nget the dementors! This is it, Hermione — ”\\nHermione put her hands on Buckbeak’s back and\\nHarry gave her a leg up. Then he placed his foot on\\none of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up\\nin front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s rope back over\\nhis neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like\\nreins.\\n“Ready?” he whispered to Hermione. “You’d better\\nhold on to me — ”\\nHe nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels.\\nBuckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry\\ngripped his flanks with his knees, feeling the great\\nwings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione was\\n \\nholding Harry very tight around the waist; he could\\nhear her muttering, “Oh, no — I don’t like this — oh, I\\nreally don’t like this — ”\\nHarry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding\\nquietly toward the upper floors of the castle. ... Harry\\npulled hard on the left-hand side of the rope, and\\nBuckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the\\nwindows flashing past —\\n“Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he\\ncould.\\nBuckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at\\na stop, unless you counted the fact that they kept\\nrising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat\\nhis wings to remain airborne.\\n“He’s there!” Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose\\nup beside the window. He reached out, and as\\nBuckbeak’s wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the\\nglass.\\nBlack looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt\\nfrom his chair, hurried to the window and tried to\\nopen it, but it was locked.\\n“Stand back!” Hermione called to him, and she took\\nout her wand, still gripping the back of Harry’s robes\\nwith her left hand.\\n“Alohomoral”\\nThe window sprang open.\\n“How — how — ?” said Black weakly, staring at the\\nhippogriff.\\n \\n“Get on — there’s not much time,” said Harry,\\ngripping Buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek\\nneck to hold him steady. “You’ve got to get out of here\\n— the dementors are coming — Macnair’s gone to get\\nthem.”\\nBlack placed a hand on either side of the window\\nframe and heaved his head and shoulders out of it. It\\nwas very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, he had\\nmanaged to fling one leg over Buckbeak’s back and\\npull himself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione.\\n“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope.\\n“Up to the tower — come on!”\\nThe hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and\\nthey were soaring upward again, high as the top of\\nthe West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a clatter on\\nthe battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him\\nat once.\\n“Sirius, you’d better go, quick,” Harry panted. “They’ll\\nreach Flitwick’s office any moment, they’ll find out\\nyou’re gone.”\\nBuckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.\\n“What happened to the other boy? Ron?” croaked\\nSirius.\\n“He’s going to be okay. He’s still out of it, but Madam\\nPomfrey says shell be able to make him better. Quick\\n- go\\nBut Black was still staring down at Harry.\\n“How can I ever thank — ”\\n“GO!” Harry and Hermione shouted together.\\n \\nBlack wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.\\n“Well see each other again,” he said. “You are — truly\\nyour father’s son, Harry. ...”\\nHe squeezed Buckbeak’s sides with his heels. Harry\\nand Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings\\nrose once more. ... The hippogriff took off into the air.\\n. . . He and his rider became smaller and smaller as\\nHarry gazed after them ... then a cloud drifted across\\nthe moon. ... They were gone.\\n \\nOWL POST AGAIN\\n“Harry!”\\nHermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her\\nwatch. “We’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back\\ndown to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us\\n— before Dumbledore locks the door — ”\\n“Okay,” said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky,\\n“let’s go. ...”\\nThey slipped through the doorway behind them and\\ndown a tightly spiraling stone staircase. As they\\nreached the bottom of it, they heard voices. They\\nflattened themselves against the wall and listened. It\\nsounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking\\nquickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase.\\n\"... only hope Dumbledore ’s not going to make\\ndifficulties,” Snape was saying. “The Kiss will be\\nperformed immediately?”\\n \\n“As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This\\nwhole Black affair has been highly embarrassing. I\\ncan’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to\\ninforming the Daily Prophet that we’ve got him at last.\\n...I daresay they’ll want to interview you, Snape ...\\nand once young Harry’s back in his right mind, I\\nexpect he’ll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you\\nsaved him. ...”\\nHarry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of\\nSnape’s smirk as he and Fudge passed Harry and\\nHermione’s hiding place. Their footsteps died away.\\nHarry and Hermione waited a few moments to make\\nsure they’d really gone, then started to run in the\\nopposite direction. Down one staircase, then another,\\nalong a new corridor — then they heard a cackling\\nahead.\\n“Peeves\\\\” Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione’s wrist.\\n“In here!”\\nThey tore into a deserted classroom to their left just\\nin time. Peeves seemed to be bouncing along the\\ncorridor in boisterous good spirits, laughing his head\\noff.\\n“Oh, he’s horrible,” whispered Hermione, her ear to\\nthe door. “I bet he’s all excited because the dementors\\nare going to finish off Sirius. ...” She checked her\\nwatch. “Three minutes, Harry!”\\nThey waited until Peeves ’s gloating voice had faded\\ninto the distance, then slid back out of the room and\\nbroke into a run again.\\n“Hermione — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back\\ninside — before Dumbledore locks the door?” Harry\\npanted.\\n \\n“I don’t want to think about it!” Hermione moaned,\\nchecking her watch again. “One minute!”\\nThey had reached the end of the corridor with the\\nhospital wing entrance. “Okay — I can hear\\nDumbledore,” said Hermione tensely. “Come on,\\nHarry!”\\nThey crept along the corridor. The door opened.\\nDumbledore ’s back appeared.\\n“I am going to lock you in,” they heard him saying. “It\\nis five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns\\nshould do it. Good luck.”\\nDumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door,\\nand took out his wand to magically lock it. Panicking,\\nHarry and Hermione ran forward. Dumbledore looked\\nup, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver\\nmustache. “Well?” he said quietly.\\n“We did it!” said Harry breathlessly. “Sirius has gone,\\non Buckbeak. ...”\\nDumbledore beamed at them.\\n“Well done. I think — ” He listened intently for any\\nsound within the hospital wing. “Yes, I think you’ve\\ngone too — get inside — I’ll lock you in — ”\\nHarry and Hermione slipped back inside the\\ndormitory. It was empty except for Ron, who was still\\nlying motionless in the end bed. As the lock clicked\\nbehind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their\\nown beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back\\nunder her robes. A moment later, Madam Pomfrey\\ncame striding back out of her office.\\n \\n“Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to\\nlook after my patients now?”\\nShe was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione\\nthought it best to accept their chocolate quietly.\\nMadam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they\\nate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and\\nHermione were waiting, listening, their nerves\\njangling. ... And then, as they both took a fourth piece\\nof chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a\\ndistant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above\\nthem. ...\\n“What was that?” said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.\\nNow they could hear angry voices, growing louder and\\nlouder. Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door.\\n“Really — they’ll wake everybody up! What do they\\nthink they’re doing?”\\nHarry was trying to hear what the voices were saying.\\nThey were drawing nearer —\\n“He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should\\nhave left somebody in the room with him. When this\\ngets out — ”\\n“HE DIDNT DISAPPARATE!” Snape roared, now very\\nclose at hand. “YOU CANT APPARATE OR\\nDISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS — HAS —\\nSOMETHING — TO — DO — WITH — POTTER!”\\n“Severus — be reasonable — Harry has been locked\\nup-”\\nBAM.\\nThe door of the hospital wing burst open.\\n \\nFudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the\\nward. Dumbledore alone looked calm. Indeed, he\\nlooked as though he was quite enjoying himself.\\nFudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.\\n“OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed. “WHAT DID\\nYOU DO?”\\n“Professor Snape!” shrieked Madam Pomfrey. “Control\\nyourself!”\\n“See here, Snape, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This\\ndoor’s been locked, we just saw — ”\\n“THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape\\nhowled, pointing at Harry and Hermione. His face was\\ntwisted; spit was flying from his mouth.\\n“Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You’re talking\\nnonsense!”\\n“YOU DONT KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape. “HE\\nDID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT — ”\\n“That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly.\\n“Think about what you are saying. This door has been\\nlocked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. Madam\\nPomfrey, have these students left their beds?”\\n“Of course not!” said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. “I\\nwould have heard them!”\\n“Well, there you have it, Severus,” said Dumbledore\\ncalmly. “Unless you are suggesting that Harry and\\nHermione are able to be in two places at once, I’m\\nafraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further.”\\nSnape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who\\nlooked thoroughly shocked at his behavior, to\\n \\nDumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind his\\nglasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind\\nhim, and stormed out of the ward.\\n“Fellow seems quite unbalanced,” said Fudge, staring\\nafter him. “I’d watch out for him if I were you,\\nDumbledore.”\\n“Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said Dumbledore quietly.\\n“He’s just suffered a severe disappointment.”\\n“He’s not the only one!” puffed Fudge. “The Daily\\nProphet’s going to have a field day! We had Black\\ncornered and he slipped through our fingers yet\\nagain! All it needs now is for the story of that\\nhippogriff’s escape to get out, and I’ll be a\\nlaughingstock! Well ... I’d better go and notify the\\nMinistry. ...”\\n“And the dementors?” said Dumbledore. “They’ll be\\nremoved from the school, I trust?”\\n“Oh yes, they’ll have to go,” said Fudge, running his\\nfingers distractedly through his hair. “Never dreamed\\nthey’d attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent\\nboy. ... Completely out of control ... no, I’ll have them\\npacked off back to Azkaban tonight. ... Perhaps we\\nshould think about dragons at the school entrance.\\n“Hagrid would like that,” said Dumbledore, smiling at\\nHarry and Hermione. As he and Fudge left the\\ndormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to the door and\\nlocked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she\\nheaded back to her office.\\nThere was a low moan from the other end of the ward.\\nRon had woken up. They could see him sitting up,\\nrubbing his head, looking around.\\n \\n“What — what happened?” he groaned. “Harry? Why\\nare we in here? Where’s Sirius? Where’s Lupin?\\nWhat’s going on?”\\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other.\\n“You explain,” said Harry, helping himself to some\\nmore chocolate.\\nWhen Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital\\nwing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost\\ndeserted castle. The sweltering heat and the end of\\nthe exams meant that everyone was taking full\\nadvantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron\\nnor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and\\nHarry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about\\nthe extraordinary events of the previous night and\\nwondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now.\\nSitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving\\nits tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the\\nthread of the conversation as he looked across to the\\nopposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him\\nfrom there just last night. ...\\nA shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a\\nvery bleary-eyed Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with\\none of his tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs and\\nbeaming down at them.\\n“Know I shouldn’ feel happy, after wha’ happened las’\\nnight,” he said. “I mean, Black escapin’ again, an’\\neverythin’ — but guess what?”\\n“What?” they said, pretending to look curious.\\n“Beaky! He escaped! He’s free! Bin celebratin’ all\\nnight!”\\n \\n“That’s wonderful!” said Hermione, giving Ron a\\nreproving look because he looked as though he was\\nclose to laughing.\\n“Yeah ... can’t’ve tied him up properly,” said Hagrid,\\ngazing happily out over the grounds. “I was worried\\nthis mornin’, mind ... thought he mighta met\\nProfessor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he\\nnever ate anythin’ las’ night. ...”\\n“What?” said Harry quickly.\\n“Blimey, haven’ yeh heard?” said Hagrid, his smile\\nfading a little. He lowered his voice, even though there\\nwas nobody in sight. “Er — Snape told all the\\nSlytherins this mornin’. ... Thought everyone ’d know\\nby now ... Professor Lupin’s a werewolf, see. An’ he\\nwas loose on the grounds las’ night. ... He’s packin’\\nnow, o’ course.”\\n“He’s packing?” said Harry, alarmed. “Why?”\\n“Leavin’, isn’ he?” said Hagrid, looking surprised that\\nHarry had to ask. “Resigned firs’ thing this mornin’.\\nSays he can’t risk it happenin’ again.”\\nHarry scrambled to his feet.\\n“I’m going to see him,” he said to Ron and Hermione.\\n“But if he’s resigned — ”\\n“ — doesn’t sound like there’s anything we can do — ”\\n“I don’t care. I still want to see him. I’ll meet you back\\nhere.”\\nLupin’s office door was open. He had already packed\\nmost of his things. The grindylow’s empty tank stood\\n \\nnext to his battered old suitcase, which was open and\\nnearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his\\ndesk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the\\ndoor.\\n“I saw you coming,” said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to\\nthe parchment he had been poring over. It was the\\nMarauder’s Map.\\n“I just saw Hagrid,” said Harry. “And he said you’d\\nresigned. It’s not true, is it?”\\n“I’m afraid it is,” said Lupin. He started opening his\\ndesk drawers and taking out the contents.\\n“Why?” said Harry. “The Ministry of Magic don’t think\\nyou were helping Sirius, do they?”\\nLupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.\\n“No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince\\nFudge that I was trying to save your lives.” He sighed.\\n“That was the final straw for Severus. I think the loss\\nof the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he — er —\\naccidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning\\nat breakfast.”\\n“You’re not leaving just because of that!” said Harry.\\nLupin smiled wryly.\\n“This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from\\nparents. ... They will not want a werewolf teaching\\ntheir children, Harry. And after last night, I see their\\npoint. I could have bitten any of you. ... That must\\nnever happen again.”\\n“You’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts\\nteacher we’ve ever had!” said Harry. “Don’t go!”\\n \\nLupin shook his head and didn’t speak. He carried on\\nemptying his drawers. Then, while Harry was trying\\nto think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin\\nsaid, “From what the headmaster told me this\\nmorning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. If\\nI’m proud of anything I’ve done this year, it’s how\\nmuch you’ve learned. ... Tell me about your\\nPatronus.”\\n“How d’you know about that?” said Harry, distracted.\\n“What else could have driven the dementors back?”\\nHarry told Lupin what had happened. When he’d\\nfinished, Lupin was smiling again.\\n“Yes, your father was always a stag when he\\ntransformed,” he said. “You guessed right ... that’s\\nwhy we called him Prongs.”\\nLupin threw his last few books into his case, closed\\nthe desk drawers, and turned to look at Harry.\\n“Here — I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last\\nnight,” he said, handing Harry back the Invisibility\\nCloak. “And ...” He hesitated, then held out the\\nMarauder’s Map too. “I am no longer your teacher, so\\nI don’t feel guilty about giving you back this as well.\\nIt’s no use to me, and I daresay you, Ron, and\\nHermione will find uses for it.”\\nHarry took the map and grinned.\\n“You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs\\nwould’ve wanted to lure me out of school ... you said\\nthey’d have thought it was funny.”\\n“And so we would have,” said Lupin, now reaching\\ndown to close his case. “I have no hesitation in saying\\n \\nthat James would have been highly disappointed if\\nhis son had never found any of the secret passages\\nout of the castle.”\\nThere was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed\\nthe Marauder’s Map and the Invisibility Cloak into his\\npocket.\\nIt was Professor Dumbledore. He didn’t look surprised\\nto see Harry there.\\n“Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,” he said.\\n“Thank you, Headmaster.”\\nLupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty\\ngrindylow tank.\\n“Well — good-bye, Harry,” he said, smiling. “It has\\nbeen a real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we’ll\\nmeet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need\\nto see me to the gates, I can manage. ...”\\nHarry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave\\nas quickly as possible.\\n“Good-bye, then, Remus,” said Dumbledore soberly.\\nLupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he\\nand Dumbledore could shake hands. Then, with a\\nfinal nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the\\noffice.\\nHarry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at\\nthe floor. He heard the door close and looked up.\\nDumbledore was still there.\\n“Why so miserable, Harry?” he said quietly. “You\\nshould be very proud of yourself after last night.”\\n \\n“It didn’t make any difference,” said Harry bitterly.\\n“Pettigrew got away.”\\n“Didn’t make any difference?” said Dumbledore\\nquietly. “It made all the difference in the world, Harry.\\nYou helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent\\nman from a terrible fate.”\\nTerrible. Something stirred in Harry’s memory.\\nGreater and more terrible than ever before ... Professor\\nTrelawney’s prediction!\\n“Professor Dumbledore — yesterday, when I was\\nhaving my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went\\nvery — very strange.”\\n“Indeed?” said Dumbledore. “Er — stranger than\\nusual, you mean?”\\n“Yes . . . her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled\\nand she said ... she said Voldemort’s servant was\\ngoing to set out to return to him before midnight. ...\\nShe said the servant would help him come back to\\npower.” Harry stared up at Dumbledore. “And then\\nshe sort of became normal again, and she couldn’t\\nremember anything she’d said. Was it — was she\\nmaking a real prediction?”\\nDumbledore looked mildly impressed.\\n“Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been,”\\nhe said thoughtfully. “Who’d have thought it? That\\nbrings her total of real predictions up to two. I should\\noffer her a pay raise. ...”\\n“But — ” Harry looked at him, aghast. How could\\nDumbledore take this so calmly?\\n \\n“But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from\\nkilling Pettigrew! That makes it my fault if Voldemort\\ncomes back!”\\n“It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn’t your\\nexperience with the Time-Turner taught you anything,\\nHarry? The consequences of our actions are always so\\ncomplicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a\\nvery difficult business indeed. ... Professor Trelawney,\\nbless her, is living proof of that. ... You did a very\\nnoble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.”\\n“But if he helps Voldemort back to power — !”\\n“Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent\\nVoldemort a deputy who is in your debt. ... When one\\nwizard saves another wizard’s life, it creates a certain\\nbond between them ... and I’m much mistaken if\\nVoldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry\\nPotter.”\\n“I don’t want a connection with Pettigrew!” said Harry.\\n“He betrayed my parents!”\\n“This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable,\\nHarry. But trust me ... the time may come when you\\nwill be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life.”\\nHarry couldn’t imagine when that would be.\\nDumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry\\nwas thinking.\\n“I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and\\nlater, Harry,” he said gently. “He would have saved\\nPettigrew too, I am sure of it.”\\nHarry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn’t laugh\\n— he could tell Dumbledore . . .\\n \\n“I thought it was my dad who’d conjured my\\nPatronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the lake\\n...I thought I was seeing him.”\\n“An easy mistake to make,” said Dumbledore softly. “I\\nexpect you 11 tire of hearing it, but you do look\\nextraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes ... you\\nhave your mother’s eyes.”\\nHarry shook his head.\\n“It was stupid, thinking it was him,” he muttered. “I\\nmean, I knew he was dead.”\\n“You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You\\nthink that we don’t recall them more clearly than ever\\nin times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you,\\nHarry, and shows himself most plainly when you have\\nneed of him. How else could you produce that\\nparticular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night.”\\nIt took a moment for Harry to realize what\\nDumbledore had said.\\n“Last night Sirius told me all about how they became\\nAnimagi,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “An\\nextraordinary achievement — not least, keeping it\\nquiet from me. And then I remembered the most\\nunusual form your Patronus took, when it charged\\nMr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against\\nRavenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see\\nyour father last night. ... You found him inside\\nyourself.”\\nAnd Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his\\nvery confused thoughts.\\n \\nNobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had\\nhappened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and\\nPettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione,\\nand Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term\\napproached, Harry heard many different theories\\nabout what had really happened, but none of them\\ncame close to the truth.\\nMalfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was\\nconvinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling\\nthe hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he\\nand his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper.\\nPercy Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the\\nsubject of Sirius’s escape.\\n“If I manage to get into the Ministry, I’ll have a lot of\\nproposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement!”\\nhe told the only person who would listen — his\\ngirlfriend, Penelope.\\nThough the weather was perfect, though the\\natmosphere was so cheerful, though he knew they\\nhad achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to\\nfreedom, Harry had never approached the end of a\\nschool year in worse spirits.\\nHe certainly wasn’t the only one who was sorry to see\\nProfessor Lupin go. The whole of Harry’s Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts class was miserable about his\\nresignation.\\n“Wonder what they’ll give us next year?” said Seamus\\nFinnigan gloomily.\\n“Maybe a vampire,” suggested Dean Thomas\\nhopefully.\\nIt wasn’t only Professor Lupin’s departure that was\\nweighing on Harry’s mind. He couldn’t help thinking a\\n \\nlot about Professor Trelawney’s prediction. He kept\\nwondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he had\\nsought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing\\nthat was lowering Harry’s spirits most of all was the\\nprospect of returning to the Dursleys. For maybe half\\nan hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed he\\nwould be living with Sirius from now on . . . his\\nparents’ best friend. ... It would have been the next\\nbest thing to having his own father back. And while\\nno news of Sirius was definitely good news, because it\\nmeant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry\\ncouldn’t help feeling miserable when he thought of\\nthe home he might have had, and the fact that it was\\nnow impossible.\\nThe exam results came out on the last day of term.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had passed every subject.\\nHarry was amazed that he had got through Potions.\\nHe had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might\\nhave stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose.\\nSnape’s behavior toward Harry over the past week\\nhad been quite alarming. Harry wouldn’t have\\nthought it possible that Snape’s dislike for him could\\nincrease, but it certainly had. A muscle twitched\\nunpleasantly at the corner of Snape’s thin mouth\\nevery time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly\\nflexing his fingers, as though itching to place them\\naround Harry’s throat.\\nPercy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and\\nGeorge had scraped a handful of O.W.L.s each.\\nGryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to their\\nspectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had\\nwon the House championship for the third year\\nrunning. This meant that the end of term feast took\\nplace amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that\\nthe Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as\\neverybody celebrated. Even Harry managed to forget\\n \\nabout the journey back to the Dursleys the next day\\nas he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.\\nAs the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the\\nnext morning, Hermione gave Harry and Ron some\\nsurprising news.\\n“I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just\\nbefore breakfast. I’ve decided to drop Muggle Studies.”\\n“But you passed your exam with three hundred and\\ntwenty percent!” said Ron.\\n“I know,” sighed Hermione, “but I can’t stand another\\nyear like this one. That Time-Turner, it was driving\\nme mad. I’ve handed it in. Without Muggle Studies\\nand Divination, I’ll be able to have a normal schedule\\nagain.”\\n“I still can’t believe you didn’t tell us about it,” said\\nRon grumpily. “We’re supposed to be your friends.”\\n“I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone,” said Hermione\\nseverely. She looked around at Harry, who was\\nwatching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a\\nmountain. Two whole months before he’d see it again.\\n“Oh, cheer up, Harry!” said Hermione sadly.\\n“I’m okay,” said Harry quickly. “Just thinking about\\nthe holidays.”\\n“Yeah, I’ve been thinking about them too,” said Ron.\\n“Harry, you’ve got to come and stay with us. I’ll fix it\\nup with Mum and Dad, then I’ll call you. I know how\\nto use a fellytone now — ”\\n \\n“A telephone, Ron,” said Hermione. “Honestly, you\\nshould take Muggle Studies next year. ...”\\nRon ignored her.\\n“It’s the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How\\nabout it, Harry? Come and stay, and we’ll go and see\\nit! Dad can usually get tickets from work.”\\nThis proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a\\ngreat deal.\\n“Yeah ... I bet the Dursleys’d be pleased to let me\\ncome ... especially after what I did to Aunt Marge. ...”\\nFeeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron\\nand Hermione in several games of Exploding Snap,\\nand when the witch with the tea cart arrived, he\\nbought himself a very large lunch, though nothing\\nwith chocolate in it.\\nBut it was late in the afternoon before the thing that\\nmade him truly happy turned up. ...\\n“Harry,” said Hermione suddenly, peering over his\\nshoulder. “What’s that thing outside your window?”\\nHarry turned to look outside. Something very small\\nand gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the\\nglass. He stood up for a better look and saw that it\\nwas a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too\\nbig for it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept\\ntumbling over in the air, buffeted this way and that in\\nthe train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the\\nwindow, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt\\nlike a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside.\\nThe owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and began\\nzooming around their compartment, apparently very\\npleased with itself for accomplishing its task. Hedwig\\n \\nclicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval.\\nCrookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with\\nhis great yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the\\nowl safely out of harm’s way.\\nHarry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him.\\nHe ripped open the letter, and shouted, “It’s from\\nSirius!”\\n“What?” said Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it\\naloud!”\\nDear Harry,\\nI hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and\\nuncle. I don’t know whether they’re used to owl post\\nBuckbeak and I are in hiding. I won’t tell you where, in\\ncase this owl falls into the wrong hands. I have some\\ndoubt about his reliability, but he is the best I could\\nfind, and he did seem eager for the job.\\nI believe the dementors are still searching for me, but\\nthey haven’t a hope of finding me here. I am planning\\nto allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon, a long way\\nfrom Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle will\\nbe lifted.\\nThere is something I never got around to telling you\\nduring our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the\\nFirebolt —\\n“Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I told you it\\nwas from him!”\\n“Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron.\\n“Ouch!” The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his\\nhand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what it\\nseemed to think was an affectionate way.\\n \\nCrookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I\\nused your name but told them to take the gold from my\\nown Gringotts vault. Please consider it as thirteen\\nbirthdays’ worth of presents from your godfather.\\nI would also like to apologize for the fright I think I\\ngave you that night last year when you left your\\nuncle’s house. I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you\\nbefore starting my journey north, but I think the sight\\nof me alarmed you.\\nI am enclosing something else for you, which I think\\nwill make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.\\nIf ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.\\nI’ll write again soon.\\nSirius\\nHarry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was\\nanother piece of parchment in there. He read it\\nthrough quickly and felt suddenly as warm and\\ncontented as though he’d swallowed a bottle of hot\\nbutterbeer in one gulp.\\nI, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give\\nhim permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.\\n“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry\\nhappily. He looked back at Sirius’s letter.\\n“Hang on, there’s a P.S. ...”\\nI thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl,\\nas it’s my fault he no longer has a rat.\\nRon’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting\\nexcitedly.\\n \\n“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at\\nthe owl for a moment; then, to Harry’s and\\nHermione’s great surprise, he held him out for\\nCrookshanks to sniff.\\n“What do’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely\\nan owl?”\\nCrookshanks purred.\\n“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s\\nmine.”\\nHarry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the\\nway back into King’s Cross station. It was still\\nclutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and\\nHermione stepped back through the barrier of\\nplatform nine and three-quarters. Harry spotted\\nUncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good\\ndistance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them\\nsuspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in\\ngreeting, his worst suspicions about them seemed\\nconfirmed.\\n“I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry\\nas Harry bid him and Hermione good-bye, then\\nwheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig’s\\ncage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his\\nusual fashion.\\n“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope\\nHarry was still clutching in his hand. “If it’s another\\nform for me to sign, you’ve got another — ”\\n“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my\\ngodfather.”\\n“Godfather?” sputtered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t\\ngot a godfather!”\\n \\n“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum\\nand dad’s best friend. He’s a convicted murderer, but\\nhe’s broken out of wizard prison and he’s on the run.\\nHe likes to keep in touch with me, though ... keep up\\nwith my news ... check if I’m happy. ...”\\nAnd, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle\\nVernon’s face, Harry set off toward the station exit,\\nHedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked\\nlike a much better summer than the last.\\n \\n/\\nTHE RIDDLE HOUSE\\nThe villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the\\nRiddle House,” even though it had been many years\\nsince the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a\\nhill overlooking the village, some of its windows\\nboarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading\\nunchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor,\\nand easily the largest and grandest building for miles\\naround, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict,\\nand unoccupied.\\nThe Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house\\nwas “creepy.” Half a century ago, something strange\\nand horrible had happened there, something that the\\nolder inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss\\nwhen topics for gossip were scarce. The story had\\nbeen picked over so many times, and had been\\nembroidered in so many places, that nobody was\\nquite sure what the truth was anymore. Every version\\nof the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty\\nyears before, at daybreak on a fine summer’s\\nmorning, when the Riddle House had still been well\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nkept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing\\nroom to find all three Riddles dead.\\nThe maid had run screaming down the hill into the\\nvillage and roused as many people as she could.\\n“Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice!\\nStill in their dinner things!”\\nThe police were summoned, and the whole of Little\\nHangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-\\ndisguised excitement. Nobody wasted their breath\\npretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they\\nhad been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs.\\nRiddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their\\ngrown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All\\nthe villagers cared about was the identity of their\\nmurderer — for plainly, three apparently healthy\\npeople did not all drop dead of natural causes on the\\nsame night.\\nThe Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade\\nthat night; the whole village seemed to have turned\\nout to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for\\nleaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived\\ndramatically in their midst and announced to the\\nsuddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce\\nhad just been arrested.\\n“Frank!” cried several people. “Never!”\\nFrank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone\\nin a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle\\nHouse. Frank had come back from the war with a\\nvery stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud\\nnoises, and had been working for the Riddles ever\\nsince.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThere was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear\\nmore details.\\n“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly\\nlistening villagers, after her fourth sherry.\\n“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa\\nonce, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to\\nmix, he didn’t.”\\n“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar, “he had a hard\\nwar, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to\\n“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked\\nthe cook. “There’s been a spare key hanging in the\\ngardener’s cottage far back as I can remember!\\nNobody forced the door last night! No broken\\nwindows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big\\nhouse while we was all sleeping. ...”\\nThe villagers exchanged dark looks.\\n“I always thought he had a nasty look about him,\\nright enough,” grunted a man at the bar.\\n“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the\\nlandlord.\\n“Told you I wouldn’t like to get on the wrong side of\\nFrank, didn’t I, Dot?” said an excited woman in the\\ncorner.\\n“Horrible temper,” said Dot, nodding fervently. “I\\nremember, when he was a kid ...”\\nBy the following morning, hardly anyone in Little\\nHangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the\\nRiddles.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBut over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton,\\nin the dark and dingy police station, Frank was\\nstubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was\\ninnocent, and that the only person he had seen near\\nthe house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been\\na teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.\\nNobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and\\nthe police were quite sure that Frank had invented\\nhim.\\nThen, just when things were looking very serious for\\nFrank, the report on the Riddles’ bodies came back\\nand changed everything.\\nThe police had never read an odder report. A team of\\ndoctors had examined the bodies and had concluded\\nthat none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed,\\nshot, strangled, suffocated, or (as far as they could\\ntell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, in a\\ntone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all\\nappeared to be in perfect health — apart from the fact\\nthat they were all dead. The doctors did note (as\\nthough determined to find something wrong with the\\nbodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror\\nupon his or her face — but as the frustrated police\\nsaid, whoever heard of three people being frightened\\nto death?\\nAs there was no proof that the Riddles had been\\nmurdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go.\\nThe Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton\\nchurchyard, and their graves remained objects of\\ncuriosity for a while. To everyone’s surprise, and amid\\na cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his\\ncottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.\\n“ ’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t\\ncare what the police say,” said Dot in the Hanged\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nMan. “And if he had any decency, he’d leave here,\\nknowing as how we knows he did it.”\\nBut Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden\\nfor the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and\\nthen the next — for neither family stayed long.\\nPerhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new\\nowners said there was a nasty feeling about the place,\\nwhich, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall\\ninto disrepair.\\nThe wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these\\ndays neither lived there nor put it to any use; they\\nsaid in the village that he kept it for “tax reasons,”\\nthough nobody was very clear what these might be.\\nThe wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the\\ngardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy-\\nseventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer\\nthan ever, but could be seen pottering around the\\nflower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds\\nwere starting to creep up on him, try as he might to\\nsuppress them.\\nWeeds were not the only things Frank had to contend\\nwith either. Boys from the village made a habit of\\nthrowing stones through the windows of the Riddle\\nHouse. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank\\nworked so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they\\nbroke into the old house for a dare. They knew that\\nold Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds\\namounted almost to an obsession, and it amused\\nthem to see him limping across the garden,\\nbrandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them.\\nFrank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him\\nbecause they, like their parents and grandparents,\\nthought him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one\\nnight in August and saw something very odd up at\\nthe old house, he merely assumed that the boys had\\ngone one step further in their attempts to punish him.\\n \\nIt was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining\\nhim worse than ever in his old age. He got up and\\nlimped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of\\nrefilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in\\nhis knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he\\nlooked up at the Riddle House and saw lights\\nglimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew at once\\nwhat was going on. The boys had broken into the\\nhouse again, and judging by the flickering quality of\\nthe light, they had started a fire.\\nFrank had no telephone, and in any case, he had\\ndeeply mistrusted the police ever since they had\\ntaken him in for questioning about the Riddles’\\ndeaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back\\nupstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was\\nsoon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing\\na rusty old key from its hook by the door. He picked\\nup his walking stick, which was propped against the\\nwall, and set off into the night.\\nThe front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of\\nbeing forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank\\nlimped around to the back of the house until he\\nreached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took\\nout the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the\\ndoor noiselessly.\\nHe let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had\\nnot entered it for many years; nevertheless, although\\nit was very dark, he remembered where the door into\\nthe hall was, and he groped his way toward it, his\\nnostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any\\nsound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He\\nreached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to\\nthe large mullioned windows on either side of the\\nfront door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing\\nthe dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it\\nmuffled the sound of his feet and stick.\\n \\nOn the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once\\nwhere the intruders were: At the very end of the\\npassage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone\\nthrough the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across\\nthe black floor. Frank edged closer and closer,\\ngrasping his walking stick firmly. Several feet from\\nthe entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the\\nroom beyond.\\nThe fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This\\nsurprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened\\nintently, for a man’s voice spoke within the room; it\\nsounded timid and fearful.\\n“There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you\\nare still hungry.”\\n“Later,” said a second voice. This too belonged to a\\nman — but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as\\na sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that\\nvoice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s\\nneck stand up. “Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.”\\nFrank turned his right ear toward the door, the better\\nto hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put\\ndown upon some hard surface, and then the dull\\nscraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across\\nthe floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his\\nback to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was\\nwearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald\\npatch at the back of his head. Then he went out of\\nsight again.\\n“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.\\n“I — I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice\\nnervously. “She set out to explore the house, I think.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said\\nthe second voice. “I will need feeding in the night. The\\njourney has tired me greatly.”\\nBrow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer\\nto the door, listening very hard. There was a pause,\\nand then the man called Wormtail spoke again.\\n“My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay\\nhere?”\\n“A week,” said the cold voice. “Perhaps longer. The\\nplace is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot\\nproceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the\\nQuidditch World Cup is over.”\\nFrank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and\\nrotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax,\\nhe had heard the word “Quidditch,” which was not a\\nword at all.\\n“The — the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said\\nWormtail. (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously\\ninto his ear.) “Forgive me, but — I do not understand\\n— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”\\n“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are\\npouring into the country from all over the world, and\\nevery meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on\\nduty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity,\\nchecking and double-checking identities. They will be\\nobsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice\\nanything. So we wait.”\\nFrank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had\\ndistinctly heard the words “Ministry of Magic,”\\n“wizards,” and “Muggles.” Plainly, each of these\\nexpressions meant something secret, and Frank could\\nthink of only two sorts of people who would speak in\\n \\ncode: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold\\non his walking stick once more, and listened more\\nclosely still.\\n“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail\\nsaid quietly.\\n“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a\\nnote of menace in the cold voice now.\\nA slight pause followed — and then Wormtail spoke,\\nthe words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he\\nwas forcing himself to say this before he lost his\\nnerve.\\n“It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.”\\nAnother pause, more protracted, and then —\\n“Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice\\nsoftly. “I see ...”\\n“My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!”\\nsaid Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. “The boy is\\nnothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we\\nwere to use another witch or wizard — any wizard —\\nthe thing could be done so much more quickly! If you\\nallowed me to leave you for a short while — you know\\nthat I can disguise myself most effectively — I could\\nbe back here in as little as two days with a suitable\\nperson — ”\\n“I could use another wizard,” said the cold voice\\nsoftly, “that is true. ...”\\n“My Lord, it makes sense,” said Wormtail, sounding\\nthoroughly relieved now. “Laying hands on Harry\\nPotter would be so difficult, he is so well protected — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a\\nsubstitute? I wonder . . . perhaps the task of nursing\\nme has become wearisome for you, “Wormtail? Could\\nthis suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing\\nmore than an attempt to desert me?”\\n“My Lord! I — I have no wish to leave you, none at all\\n“Do not lie to me!” hissed the second voice. “I can\\nalways tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever\\nreturned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you\\nlook at me, feel you shudder when you touch me. ...”\\n“No! My devotion to Your Lordship — ”\\n“Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You\\nwould not be here if you had anywhere else to go.\\nHow am I to survive without you, when I need feeding\\nevery few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?”\\n“But you seem so much stronger, My Lord — ”\\n“Liar,” breathed the second voice. “I am no stronger,\\nand a few days alone would be enough to rob me of\\nthe little health I have regained under your clumsy\\ncare. Silencel”\\nWormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell\\nsilent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear\\nnothing but the fire crackling. Then the second man\\nspoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.\\n“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have\\nalready explained to you, and I will use no other. I\\nhave waited thirteen years. A few more months will\\nmake no difference. As for the protection surrounding\\nthe boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is\\nneeded is a little courage from you, Wormtail —\\n \\ncourage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full\\nextent of Lord Voldemort’s wrath — ”\\n“My Lord, I must speak!” said Wormtail, panic in his\\nvoice now. “All through our journey I have gone over\\nthe plan in my head — My Lord, Bertha Jorkins’s\\ndisappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if\\nwe proceed, if I murder — ”\\n“IP” whispered the second voice. “If? If you follow the\\nplan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that\\nanyone else has died. You will do it quietly and\\nwithout fuss; I only wish that I could do it myself, but\\nin my present condition ... Come, Wormtail, one more\\ndeath and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not\\nasking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful\\nservant will have rejoined us — ”\\n“I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest\\ntrace of sullenness in his voice.\\n“Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody\\nwhose loyalty has never wavered, and you,\\nunfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.”\\n“I found you,” said Wormtail, and there was definitely\\na sulky edge to his voice now. “I was the one who\\nfound you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins.”\\n“That is true,” said the second man, sounding\\namused. “A stroke of brilliance I would not have\\nthought possible from you, Wormtail — though, if\\ntruth be told, you were not aware how useful she\\nwould be when you caught her, were you?”\\n“I — I thought she might be useful, My Lord — ”\\n“Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel\\namusement more pronounced than ever. “However, I\\n \\ndo not deny that her information was invaluable.\\nWithout it, I could never have formed our plan, and\\nfor that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will\\nallow you to perform an essential task for me, one\\nthat many of my followers would give their right\\nhands to perform. ...”\\n“R-really, My Lord? What — ?” Wormtail sounded\\nterrified again.\\n“Ah, Wormtail, you don’t want me to spoil the\\nsurprise? Your part will come at the very end ... but I\\npromise you, you will have the honor of being just as\\nuseful as Bertha Jorkins.”\\n“You ... you ...” Wormtail’s voice suddenly sounded\\nhoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry. “You\\n. . . are going ... to kill me too?”\\n“Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily, “why\\nwould I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She\\nwas fit for nothing after my questioning, quite\\nuseless. In any case, awkward questions would have\\nbeen asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with\\nthe news that she had met you on her holidays.\\nWizards who are supposed to be dead would do well\\nnot to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside\\ninns. ...”\\nWormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank\\ncould not hear it, but it made the second man laugh\\n— an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.\\n“We could have modified her memory? But Memory\\nCharms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I\\nproved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to\\nher memory not to use the information I extracted\\nfrom her, Wormtail.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nOut in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware\\nthat the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery\\nwith sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a\\nwoman. He was talking about it without any kind of\\nremorse — with amusement. He was dangerous — a\\nmadman. And he was planning more murders — this\\nboy, Harry Potter, whoever he was — was in danger —\\nFrank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the\\ntime to go to the police. He would creep out of the\\nhouse and head straight for the telephone box in the\\nvillage . . . but the cold voice was speaking again, and\\nFrank remained where he was, frozen to the spot,\\nlistening with all his might.\\n“One more murder . . . my faithful servant at Hogwarts\\n... Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is\\ndecided. There will be no more argument. But quiet ...\\nI think I hear Nagini. ...”\\nAnd the second man’s voice changed. He started\\nmaking noises such as Frank had never heard before;\\nhe was hissing and spitting without drawing breath.\\nFrank thought he must be having some sort of fit or\\nseizure.\\nAnd then Frank heard movement behind him in the\\ndark passageway. He turned to look, and found\\nhimself paralyzed with fright.\\nSomething was slithering toward him along the dark\\ncorridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of\\nfirelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a\\ngigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified,\\ntransfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a\\nwide, curving track through the thick dust on the\\nfloor, coming closer and closer — What was he to do?\\nThe only means of escape was into the room where\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ntwo men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where\\nhe was the snake would surely kill him —\\nBut before he had made his decision, the snake was\\nlevel with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it\\nwas passing; it was following the spitting, hissing\\nnoises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in\\nseconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had\\nvanished through the gap.\\nThere was sweat on Frank’s forehead now, and the\\nhand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the\\nroom, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and\\nFrank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible\\nidea. . . . This man could talk to snakes.\\nFrank didn’t understand what was going on. He\\nwanted more than anything to be back in his bed with\\nhis hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs\\ndidn’t seem to want to move. As he stood there\\nshaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice\\nswitched abruptly to English again.\\n“Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,” it said.\\n“In-indeed, My Lord?” said Wormtail.\\n“Indeed, yes,” said the voice. “According to Nagini,\\nthere is an old Muggle standing right outside this\\nroom, listening to every word we say.”\\nFrank didn’t have a chance to hide himself. There\\nwere footsteps, and then the door of the room was\\nflung wide open.\\nA short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed\\nnose, and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a\\nmixture of fear and alarm in his face.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your\\nmanners?”\\nThe cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair\\nbefore the fire, but Frank couldn’t see the speaker.\\nThe snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the\\nrotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet\\ndog.\\nWormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still\\ndeeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his\\nwalking stick and limped over the threshold.\\nThe fire was the only source of light in the room; it\\ncast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank\\nstared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it\\nseemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank\\ncouldn’t even see the back of his head.\\n“You heard everything, Muggle?” said the cold voice.\\n“What’s that you’re calling me?” said Frank defiantly,\\nfor now that he was inside the room, now that the\\ntime had come for some sort of action, he felt braver;\\nit had always been so in the war.\\n“I am calling you a Muggle,” said the voice coolly. “It\\nmeans that you are not a wizard.”\\n“I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank,\\nhis voice growing steadier. “All I know is I’ve heard\\nenough to interest the police tonight, I have. You’ve\\ndone murder and you’re planning more! And I’ll tell\\nyou this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration, “my\\nwife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back — ”\\n“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly.\\n“Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nyou were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort,\\nMuggle, for he knows ... he always knows. ...”\\n“Is that right?” said Frank roughly. “Lord, is it? Well, I\\ndon’t think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn\\n’round and face me like a man, why don’t you?”\\n“But I am not a man, Muggle,” said the cold voice,\\nbarely audible now over the crackling of the flames. “I\\nam much, much more than a man. However ... why\\nnot? I will face you. ... Wormtail, come turn my chair\\naround.”\\nThe servant gave a whimper.\\n“You heard me, Wormtail.”\\nSlowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would\\nrather have done anything than approach his master\\nand the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small\\nman walked forward and began to turn the chair. The\\nsnake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed\\nslightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.\\nAnd then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw\\nwhat was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the\\nfloor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out\\na scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never\\nheard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it\\nraised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a\\nrushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was\\ndead before he hit the floor.\\nTwo hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter\\nwoke with a start.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE SCAR\\nHarry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though\\nhe had been running. He had awoken from a vivid\\ndream with his hands pressed over his face. The old\\nscar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of\\nlightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though\\nsomeone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his\\nskin.\\nHe sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other\\nreaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which\\nwere on the bedside table. He put them on and his\\nbedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty\\norange light that was filtering through the curtains\\nfrom the street lamp outside the window.\\nHarry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still\\npainful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled\\nout of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe,\\nand peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A\\nskinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright\\ngreen eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nexamined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more\\nclosely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging.\\nHarry tried to recall what he had been dreaming\\nabout before he had awoken. It had seemed so real. ...\\nThere had been two people he knew and one he\\ndidn’t. ... He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to\\nremember. ...\\nThe dim picture of a darkened room came to him. ...\\nThere had been a snake on a hearth rug ... a small\\nman called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail ... and a cold,\\nhigh voice ... the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt\\nas though an ice cube had slipped down into his\\nstomach at the very thought. ...\\nHe closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what\\nVoldemort had looked like, but it was impossible. ...\\nAll Harry knew was that at the moment when\\nVoldemort’s chair had swung around, and he, Harry,\\nhad seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of\\nhorror, which had awoken him ... or had that been\\nthe pain in his scar?\\nAnd who had the old man been? For there had\\ndefinitely been an old man; Harry had watched him\\nfall to the ground. It was all becoming confused.\\nHarry put his face into his hands, blocking out his\\nbedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly\\nlit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his\\ncupped hands; the details were now trickling away as\\nfast as he tried to hold on to them. ... Voldemort and\\nWormtail had been talking about someone they had\\nkilled, though Harry could not remember the name . . .\\nand they had been plotting to kill someone else . . .\\nhim).\\nHarry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes,\\nand stared around his bedroom as though expecting\\n \\nto see something unusual there. As it happened,\\nthere were an extraordinary number of unusual\\nthings in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open\\nat the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron,\\nbroomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks.\\nRolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that\\nwas not taken up by the large, empty cage in which\\nhis snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor\\nbeside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been\\nreading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures\\nin this book were all moving. Men in bright orange\\nrobes were zooming in and out of sight on\\nbroomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.\\nHarry walked over to the book, picked it up, and\\nwatched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal\\nby putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop.\\nThen he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch — in\\nHarry’s opinion, the best sport in the world —\\ncouldn’t distract him at the moment. He placed Flying\\nwith the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the\\nwindow, and drew back the curtains to survey the\\nstreet below.\\nPrivet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban\\nstreet would be expected to look in the early hours of\\nSaturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far\\nas Harry could see through the darkness, there\\nwasn’t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.\\nAnd yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restlessly back to\\nthe bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his\\nscar again. It wasn’t the pain that bothered him;\\nHarry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost\\nall the bones from his right arm once and had them\\npainfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been\\npierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long\\nafterward. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet\\nfrom an airborne broomstick. He was used to bizarre\\n \\naccidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you\\nattended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\\nand had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.\\nNo, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the\\nlast time his scar had hurt him, it had been because\\nVoldemort had been close by. ... But Voldemort\\ncouldn’t be here, now. ... The idea of Voldemort\\nlurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible. ...\\nHarry listened closely to the silence around him. Was\\nhe half-expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the\\nswish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as he\\nheard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting\\nsnore from the next room.\\nHarry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid.\\nThere was no one in the house with him except Uncle\\nVernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were\\nplainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and\\npainless.\\nAsleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it\\nwasn’t as though they were ever any help to him\\nawake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were\\nHarry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles who\\nhated and despised magic in any form, which meant\\nthat Harry was about as welcome in their house as\\ndry rot. They had explained away Harry’s long\\nabsences at Hogwarts over the last three years by\\ntelling everyone that he went to St. Brutus’s Secure\\nCenter for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew\\nperfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry\\nwasn’t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but\\nthey were still apt to blame him for anything that\\nwent wrong about the house. Harry had never been\\nable to confide in them or tell them anything about\\nhis life in the wizarding world. The very idea of going\\nto them when they awoke, and telling them about his\\n \\nscar hurting him, and about his worries about\\nVoldemort, was laughable.\\nAnd yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had\\ncome to live with the Dursleys in the first place. If it\\nhadn’t been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had\\nthe lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn’t been for\\nVoldemort, Harry would still have had parents. ...\\nHarry had been a year old the night that Voldemort —\\nthe most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard\\nwho had been gaining power steadily for eleven years\\n— arrived at his house and killed his father and\\nmother. Voldemort had then turned his wand on\\nHarry; he had performed the curse that had disposed\\nof many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady\\nrise to power — and, incredibly, it had not worked.\\nInstead of killing the small boy, the curse had\\nrebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with\\nnothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead,\\nand Voldemort had been reduced to something barely\\nalive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished,\\nVoldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret\\ncommunity of witches and wizards had lived for so\\nlong had lifted, Voldemort’s followers had disbanded,\\nand Harry Potter had become famous.\\nIt had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover,\\non his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had\\nbeen even more disconcerting to find out that\\neveryone in the hidden wizarding world knew his\\nname. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that\\nheads turned and whispers followed him wherever he\\nwent. But he was used to it now: At the end of this\\nsummer, he would be starting his fourth year at\\nHogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days\\nuntil he would be back at the castle again.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBut there was still a fortnight to go before he went\\nback to school. He looked hopelessly around his room\\nagain, and his eye paused on the birthday cards his\\ntwo best friends had sent him at the end of July.\\nWhat would they say if Harry wrote to them and told\\nthem about his scar hurting?\\nAt once, Hermione Granger’s voice seemed to fill his\\nhead, shrill and panicky.\\n“ Your scar hurt? Harry, that’s really serious. . . . Write\\nto Professor Dumbledorel And I’ll go and check\\nCommon Magical Ailments and Afflictions. ... Maybe\\nthere’s something in there about curse scars. ...”\\nYes, that would be Hermione’s advice: Go straight to\\nthe headmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime,\\nconsult a book. Harry stared out of the window at the\\ninky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a\\nbook could help him now. As far as he knew, he was\\nthe only living person to have survived a curse like\\nVoldemort’s; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he\\nwould find his symptoms listed in Common Magical\\nAilments and Afflictions. As for informing the\\nheadmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore\\nwent during the summer holidays. He amused himself\\nfor a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long\\nsilver beard, full-length wizard’s robes, and pointed\\nhat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing\\nsuntan lotion onto his long crooked nose. Wherever\\nDumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that\\nHedwig would be able to find him; Harry’s owl had\\nnever yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even\\nwithout an address. But what would he write?\\nDear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but\\nmy scar hurt this morning. Yours sincerely, Harry\\nPotter.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nEven inside his head the words sounded stupid.\\nAnd so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron\\nWeasley’s, reaction, and in a moment, Ron’s red hair\\nand long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before\\nHarry, wearing a bemused expression.\\n“ Your scar hurt? But ... but You-Knotu-Who can’t be\\nnear you now, can he? I mean ... you’d know, wouldn’t\\nyou? He’d be trying to do you in again, wouldn’t he? I\\ndunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a bit\\n... I’ll ask Dad. ...”\\nMr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked\\nin the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the\\nMinistry of Magic, but he didn’t have any particular\\nexpertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry\\nknew. In any case, Harry didn’t like the idea of the\\nwhole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was\\ngetting jumpy about a few moments’ pain. Mrs.\\nWeasley would fuss worse than Hermione, and Fred\\nand George, Ron’s sixteen-year-old twin brothers,\\nmight think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys\\nwere Harry’s favorite family in the world; he was\\nhoping that they might invite him to stay any time\\nnow (Ron had mentioned something about the\\nQuidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn’t want\\nhis visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his\\nscar.\\nHarry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What\\nhe really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit\\nit to himself) was someone like — someone like a\\nparent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask\\nwithout feeling stupid, someone who cared about\\nhim, who had had experience with Dark Magic. ...\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nAnd then the solution came to him. It was so simple,\\nand so obvious, that he couldn’t believe it had taken\\nso long — Sirius.\\nHarry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room,\\nand sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of\\nparchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill\\nwith ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering\\nhow best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the\\nfact that he hadn’t thought of Sirius straight away.\\nBut then, perhaps it wasn’t so surprising — after all,\\nhe had only found out that Sirius was his godfather\\ntwo months ago.\\nThere was a simple reason for Sirius’s complete\\nabsence from Harry’s life until then — Sirius had\\nbeen in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by\\ncreatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking\\nfiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts\\nwhen he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent\\n— the murders for which he had been convicted had\\nbeen committed by Wormtail, Voldemort’s supporter,\\nwhom nearly everybody now believed dead. Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they\\nhad come face-to-face with Wormtail only the\\nprevious year, though only Professor Dumbledore had\\nbelieved their story.\\nFor one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was\\nleaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had\\noffered him a home once his name had been cleared.\\nBut the chance had been snatched away from him —\\nWormtail had escaped before they could take him to\\nthe Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for\\nhis life. Harry had helped him escape on the back of a\\nhippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius\\nhad been on the run. The home Harry might have had\\nif Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him\\nall summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the\\n \\nDursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them\\nforever.\\nNevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry,\\neven if he couldn’t be with him. It was due to Sirius\\nthat Harry now had all his school things in his\\nbedroom with him. The Dursleys had never allowed\\nthis before; their general wish of keeping Harry as\\nmiserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his\\npowers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the\\ncupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this.\\nBut their attitude had changed since they had found\\nout that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a\\ngodfather — for Harry had conveniently forgotten to\\ntell them that Sirius was innocent.\\nHarry had received two letters from Sirius since he\\nhad been back at Privet Drive. Both had been\\ndelivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards),\\nbut by large, brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig\\nhad not approved of these flashy intruders; she had\\nbeen most reluctant to allow them to drink from her\\nwater tray before flying off again. Harry, on the other\\nhand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm\\ntrees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever\\nSirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were\\nintercepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow,\\nHarry found it hard to imagine dementors surviving\\nfor long in bright sunlight; perhaps that was why\\nSirius had gone south. Sirius’s letters, which were\\nnow hidden beneath the highly useful loose\\nfloorboard under Harry’s bed, sounded cheerful, and\\nin both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him\\nif ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to now, all\\nright. ...\\nHarry’s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray\\nlight that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room.\\nFinally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom\\n \\nwalls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement\\ncould be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia’s\\nroom, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of\\nparchment and reread his finished letter.\\nDear Sirius,\\nThanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it\\ncould hardly get through my window.\\nThings are the same as usual here. Dudley’s diet isn’t\\ngoing too well. My aunt found him smuggling\\ndoughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him\\nthey ’d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing\\nit, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation\\nout of the window. That’s a sort of computer thing you\\ncan play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn’t\\neven got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind\\noff things.\\nI’m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified\\nyou might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask\\nyou to.\\nA weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar\\nhurt again. Last time that happened it was because\\nVoldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don’t reckon he can\\nbe anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if\\ncurse scars sometimes hurt years afterward?\\nI’ll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she’s\\noffhunt-\\\\ing at the moment. Say hello to Buckbeak for\\nme.\\nHarry\\nYes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was\\nno point putting in the dream; he didn’t want it to\\nlook as though he was too worried. He folded up the\\n \\nparchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for\\nwhen Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet,\\nstretched, and opened his wardrobe once more.\\nWithout glancing at his reflection, he started to get\\ndressed before going down to breakfast.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n3\\nTHE INVITATION\\nBy the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three\\nDursleys were already seated around the table. None\\nof them looked up as he entered or sat down. Uncle\\nVernon’s large red face was hidden behind the\\nmorning’s Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a\\ngrapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her\\nhorselike teeth.\\nDudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow\\nseemed to be taking up even more space than usual.\\nThis was saying something, as he always took up an\\nentire side of the square table by himself. When Aunt\\nPetunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto\\nDudley’s plate with a tremulous “There you are, Diddy\\ndarling,” Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a\\nmost unpleasant turn since he had come home for\\nthe summer with his end-of-year report.\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find\\nexcuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia\\nalways insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy\\nwhose teachers didn’t understand him, while Uncle\\n \\nVernon maintained that “he didn’t want some swotty\\nlittle nancy boy for a son anyway.” They also skated\\nover the accusations of bullying in the report — “He’s\\na boisterous little boy, but he wouldn’t hurt a fly!”\\nAunt Petunia had said tearfully.\\nHowever, at the bottom of the report there were a few\\nwell-chosen comments from the school nurse that not\\neven Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain\\naway. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that\\nDudley was big-boned, and that his poundage was\\nreally puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who\\nneeded plenty of food, the fact remained that the\\nschool outfitters didn’t stock knickerbockers big\\nenough for him anymore. The school nurse had seen\\nwhat Aunt Petunia’s eyes — so sharp when it came to\\nspotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in\\nobserving the comings and goings of the neighbors —\\nsimply refused to see: that far from needing extra\\nnourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size\\nand weight of a young killer whale.\\nSo — after many tantrums, after arguments that\\nshook Harry’s bedroom floor, and many tears from\\nAunt Petunia — the new regime had begun. The diet\\nsheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school\\nnurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been\\nemptied of all Dudley’s favorite things — fizzy drinks\\nand cakes, chocolate bars and burgers — and filled\\ninstead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of\\nthings that Uncle Vernon called “rabbit food.” To\\nmake Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had\\ninsisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She\\nnow passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed\\nthat it was a lot smaller than Dudley’s. Aunt Petunia\\nseemed to feel that the best way to keep up Dudley’s\\nmorale was to make sure that he did, at least, get\\nmore to eat than Harry.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBut Aunt Petunia didn’t know what was hidden under\\nthe loose floorboard upstairs. She had no idea that\\nHarry was not following the diet at all. The moment\\nhe had got wind of the fact that he was expected to\\nsurvive the summer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent\\nHedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they\\nhad risen to the occasion magnificently. Hedwig had\\nreturned from Hermione’s house with a large box\\nstuffed full of sugar-free snacks. (Hermione’s parents\\nwere dentists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had\\nobliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock\\ncakes. (Harry hadn’t touched these; he had had too\\nmuch experience of Hagrid ’s cooking.) Mrs. Weasley,\\nhowever, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an\\nenormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies. Poor\\nErrol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a full\\nfive days to recover from the journey. And then on\\nHarry’s birthday (which the Dursleys had completely\\nignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes,\\none each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Sirius.\\nHarry still had two of them left, and so, looking\\nforward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs,\\nhe ate his grapefruit without complaint.\\nUncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of\\ndisapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit\\nquarter.\\n“Is this it?” he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.\\nAunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then\\nnodded pointedly at Dudley, who had already finished\\nhis own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry’s\\nwith a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.\\nUncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his\\nlarge, bushy mustache, and picked up his spoon.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThe doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out\\nof his chair and set off down the hall. Quick as a\\nflash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle,\\nDudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon’s grapefruit.\\nHarry heard talking at the door, and someone\\nlaughing, and Uncle Vernon answering curtly. Then\\nthe front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper\\ncame from the hall.\\nAunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and\\nlooked curiously around to see where Uncle Vernon\\nhad got to. She didn’t have to wait long to find out;\\nafter about a minute, he was back. He looked livid.\\n“You,” he barked at Harry. “In the living room. Now.”\\nBewildered, wondering what on earth he was\\nsupposed to have done this time, Harry got up and\\nfollowed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the\\nnext room. Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply\\nbehind both of them.\\n“So,” he said, marching over to the fireplace and\\nturning to face Harry as though he were about to\\npronounce him under arrest. “So.”\\nHarry would have dearly loved to have said, “So\\nwhat?” but he didn’t feel that Uncle Vernon’s temper\\nshould be tested this early in the morning, especially\\nwhen it was already under severe strain from lack of\\nfood. He therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.\\n“This just arrived,” said Uncle Vernon. He brandished\\na piece of purple writing paper at Harry. “A letter.\\nAbout you.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry’s confusion increased. Who would be writing to\\nUncle Vernon about him? Who did he know who sent\\nletters by the postman?\\nUncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at\\nthe letter and began to read aloud:\\nDear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,\\nWe have never been introduced, but I am sure you\\nhave heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron.\\nAs Harry might have told you, the final of the\\nQuidditch World Cup takes place this Monday night,\\nand my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get\\nprime tickets through his connections at the\\nDepartment of Magical Games and Sports.\\nI do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match,\\nas this really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain\\nhasn’t hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are\\nextremely hard to come by. We would of course be glad\\nto have Harry stay for the remainder of the summer\\nholidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to\\nschool.\\nIt would be best for Harry to send us your answer as\\nquickly as possible in the normal way, because the\\nMuggle postman has never delivered to our house, and\\nI am not sure he even knows where it is.\\nHoping to see Harry soon,\\nYours sincerely,\\nMolly Weasley\\nP.S. I do hope we’ve put enough stamps on.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nUncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back\\ninto his breast pocket, and drew out something else.\\n“Look at this,” he growled.\\nHe held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley’s\\nletter had come, and Harry had to fight down a laugh.\\nEvery bit of it was covered in stamps except for a\\nsquare inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley\\nhad squeezed the Dursleys’ address in minute\\nwriting.\\n“She did put enough stamps on, then,” said Harry,\\ntrying to sound as though Mrs. Weasley’s was a\\nmistake anyone could make. His uncle’s eyes flashed.\\n“The postman noticed,” he said through gritted teeth.\\n“Very interested to know where this letter came from,\\nhe was. That’s why he rang the doorbell. Seemed to\\nthink it was funny.”\\nHarry didn’t say anything. Other people might not\\nunderstand why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss\\nabout too many stamps, but Harry had lived with the\\nDursleys too long not to know how touchy they were\\nabout anything even slightly out of the ordinary. Their\\nworst fear was that someone would find out that they\\nwere connected (however distantly) with people like\\nMrs. Weasley.\\nUncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to\\nkeep his expression neutral. If he didn’t do or say\\nanything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of a\\nlifetime. He waited for Uncle Vernon to say\\nsomething, but he merely continued to glare. Harry\\ndecided to break the silence.\\n“So — can I go then?” he asked.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nA slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon’s large purple\\nface. The mustache bristled. Harry thought he knew\\nwhat was going on behind the mustache: a furious\\nbattle as two of Uncle Vernon’s most fundamental\\ninstincts came into conflict. Allowing Harry to go\\nwould make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon\\nhad struggled against for thirteen years. On the other\\nhand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys’ for\\nthe rest of the summer would get rid of him two\\nweeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and\\nUncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house. To\\ngive himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down\\nat Mrs. Weasley’s letter again.\\n“Who is this woman?” he said, staring at the\\nsignature with distaste.\\n“You’ve seen her,” said Harry. “She’s my friend Ron’s\\nmother, she was meeting him off the Hog — off the\\nschool train at the end of last term.”\\nHe had almost said “Hogwarts Express,” and that was\\na sure way to get his uncle’s temper up. Nobody ever\\nmentioned the name of Harry’s school aloud in the\\nDursley household.\\nUncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as\\nthough trying to remember something very\\nunpleasant.\\n“Dumpy sort of woman?” he growled finally. “Load of\\nchildren with red hair?”\\nHarry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle\\nVernon to call anyone “dumpy,” when his own son,\\nDudley, had finally achieved what he’d been\\nthreatening to do since the age of three, and become\\nwider than he was tall.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nUncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.\\n“Quidditch,” he muttered under his breath.\\n“Quidditch — what is this rubbish?”\\nHarry felt a second stab of annoyance.\\n“It’s a sport,” he said shortly. “Played on broom — ”\\n“All right, all right!” said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry\\nsaw, with some satisfaction, that his uncle looked\\nvaguely panicky. Apparently his nerves couldn’t stand\\nthe sound of the word “broomsticks” in his living\\nroom. He took refuge in perusing the letter again.\\nHarry saw his lips form the words “send us your\\nanswer ... in the normal way.” He scowled.\\n“What does she mean, ‘the normal way’?” he spat.\\n“Normal for us,” said Harry, and before his uncle\\ncould stop him, he added, “you know, owl post. That’s\\nwhat’s normal for wizards.”\\nUncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just\\nuttered a disgusting swear word. Shaking with anger,\\nhe shot a nervous look through the window, as\\nthough expecting to see some of the neighbors with\\ntheir ears pressed against the glass.\\n“How many times do I have to tell you not to mention\\nthat unnaturalness under my roof?” he hissed, his\\nface now a rich plum color. “You stand there, in the\\nclothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful\\nback — ”\\n“Only after Dudley finished with them,” said Harry\\ncoldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so\\nlarge for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nfive times so as to be able to use his hands, and\\nwhich fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.\\n“I will not be spoken to like that!” said Uncle Vernon,\\ntrembling with rage.\\nBut Harry wasn’t going to stand for this. Gone were\\nthe days when he had been forced to take every single\\none of the Dursleys’ stupid rules. He wasn’t following\\nDudley’s diet, and he wasn’t going to let Uncle Vernon\\nstop him from going to the Quidditch World Cup, not\\nif he could help it. Harry took a deep, steadying\\nbreath and then said, “Okay, I can’t see the World\\nCup. Can I go now, then? Only I’ve got a letter to\\nSirius I want to finish. You know — my godfather.”\\nHe had done it. He had said the magic words. Now he\\nwatched the purple recede blotchily from Uncle\\nVernon’s face, making it look like badly mixed black\\ncurrant ice cream.\\n“You’re — you’re writing to him, are you?” said Uncle\\nVernon, in a would-be calm voice — but Harry had\\nseen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden\\nfear.\\n“Well — yeah,” said Harry, casually. “It’s been a while\\nsince he heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn’t,\\nhe might start thinking something’s wrong.”\\nHe stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words.\\nHe could almost see the cogs working under Uncle\\nVernon’s thick, dark, neatly parted hair. If he tried to\\nstop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry\\nwas being mistreated. If he told Harry he couldn’t go\\nto the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and\\ntell Sirius, who would know Harry was being\\nmistreated. There was only one thing for Uncle\\nVernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion forming\\n \\nin his uncle’s mind as though the great mustached\\nface were transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to\\nkeep his own face as blank as possible. And then —\\n“Well, all right then. You can go to this ruddy ... this\\nstupid ... this World Cup thing. You write and tell\\nthese — these Weasleys they’re to pick you up, mind.\\nI haven’t got time to go dropping you off all over the\\ncountry. And you can spend the rest of the summer\\nthere. And you can tell your — your godfather ... tell\\nhim ... tell him you’re going.”\\n“Okay then,” said Harry brightly.\\nHe turned and walked toward the living room door,\\nfighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop. He\\nwas going ... he was going to the Weasleys’, he was\\ngoing to watch the Quidditch World Cup!\\nOutside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who\\nhad been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to\\noverhear Harry being told off. He looked shocked to\\nsee the broad grin on Harry’s face.\\n“That was an excellent breakfast, wasn’t it?” said\\nHarry. “I feel really full, don’t you?”\\nLaughing at the astonished look on Dudley’s face,\\nHarry took the stairs three at a time, and hurled\\nhimself back into his bedroom.\\nThe first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She\\nwas sitting in her cage, staring at Harry with her\\nenormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the\\nway that meant she was annoyed about something.\\nExactly what was annoying her became apparent\\nalmost at once.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“OUCH!” said Harry as what appeared to be a small,\\ngray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his\\nhead. Harry massaged the spot furiously, looking up\\nto see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small\\nenough to fit into the palm of his hand, whizzing\\nexcitedly around the room like a loose firework. Harry\\nthen realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his\\nfeet. Harry bent down, recognized Ron’s handwriting,\\nthen tore open the envelope. Inside was a hastily\\nscribbled note.\\nHarry — DAD GOT THE TICKETS — Ireland versus\\nBulgaria, Monday night. Mum’s writing to the Muggles\\nto ask you to stay. They might already have the letter,\\nI don’t know how fast Muggle post is. Thought I’d send\\nthis with Pig anyway.\\nHarry stared at the word “Pig,” then looked up at the\\ntiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the\\nceiling. He had never seen anything that looked less\\nlike a pig. Maybe he couldn’t read Ron’s writing. He\\nwent back to the letter:\\nWe’re coming for you whether the Muggles like it or\\nnot, you can’t miss the World Cup, only Mum and Dad\\nreckon it’s better if we pretend to ask their permission\\nfirst. If they say yes, send Pig back with your answer\\npronto, and we’ll come and get you at five o’clock on\\nSunday. If they say no, send Pig back pronto and we’ll\\ncome and get you at five o’clock on Sunday anyway.\\nHermione’s arriving this afternoon. Percy’s started\\nwork — the Department of International Magical\\nCooperation. Don’t mention anything about Abroad\\nwhile you’re here unless you want the pants bored off\\nyou.\\nSee you soon —\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nRon\\n“Calm down!” Harry said as the small owl flew low\\nover his head, twittering madly with what Harry could\\nonly assume was pride at having delivered the letter\\nto the right person. “Come here, I need you to take my\\nanswer back!”\\nThe owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig’s cage.\\nHedwig looked coldly up at it, as though daring it to\\ntry and come any closer.\\nHarry seized his eagle-feather quill once more,\\ngrabbed a fresh piece of parchment, and wrote:\\nRon, it’s all okay, the Muggles say I can come. See you\\nfive o’clock tomorrow. Can’t wait.\\nHarry\\nHe folded this note up very small, and with immense\\ndifficulty, tied it to the tiny owl’s leg as it hopped on\\nthe spot with excitement. The moment the note was\\nsecure, the owl was off again; it zoomed out of the\\nwindow and out of sight.\\nHarry turned to Hedwig.\\n“Feeling up to a long journey?” he asked her.\\nHedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way.\\n“Can you take this to Sirius for me?” he said, picking\\nup his letter. “Hang on ... I just want to finish it.”\\nHe unfolded the parchment and hastily added a\\npostscript.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nIf you want to contact me, I’ll be at my friend Ron\\nWeasley’s for the rest of the summer. His dad’s got us\\ntickets for the Quidditch World Cup\\\\\\nThe letter finished, he tied it to Hedwig’s leg; she kept\\nunusually still, as though determined to show him\\nhow a real post owl should behave.\\n“I’ll be at Ron’s when you get back, all right?” Harry\\ntold her.\\nShe nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft\\nswooshing noise, spread her enormous wings and\\nsoared out of the open window.\\nHarry watched her out of sight, then crawled under\\nhis bed, wrenched up the loose floorboard, and pulled\\nout a large chunk of birthday cake. He sat there on\\nthe floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was\\nflooding through him. He had cake, and Dudley had\\nnothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summer’s day,\\nhe would be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, his scar\\nfelt perfectly normal again, and he was going to watch\\nthe Quidditch World Cup. It was hard, just now, to\\nfeel worried about anything — even Lord Voldemort.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBACK TO THE BURROW\\nBy twelve o’clock the next day, Harry’s school trunk\\nwas packed with his school things and all his most\\nprized possessions — the Invisibility Cloak he had\\ninherited from his father, the broomstick he had\\ngotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he\\nhad been given by Fred and George Weasley last year.\\nHe had emptied his hiding place under the loose\\nfloorboard of all food, double-checked every nook and\\ncranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or\\nquills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting\\ndown the days to September the first, on which he\\nliked to cross off the days remaining until his return\\nto Hogwarts.\\nThe atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was\\nextremely tense. The imminent arrival at their house\\nof an assortment of wizards was making the Dursleys\\nuptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked\\ndownright alarmed when Harry informed him that the\\nWeasley s would be arriving at five o’clock the very\\nnext day.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,”\\nhe snarled at once. “I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot\\nwear. They’d better have the decency to put on\\nnormal clothes, that’s all.”\\nHarry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely\\nseen Mr. or Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the\\nDursleys would call “normal.” Their children might\\ndon Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and\\nMrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying\\nstates of shabbiness. Harry wasn’t bothered about\\nwhat the neighbors would think, but he was anxious\\nabout how rude the Dursleys might be to the\\nWeasleys if they turned up looking like their worst\\nidea of wizards.\\nUncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some\\npeople, this might have looked like a gesture of\\nwelcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle\\nVernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating.\\nDudley, on the other hand, looked somehow\\ndiminished. This was not because the diet was at last\\ntaking effect, but due to fright. Dudley had emerged\\nfrom his last encounter with a fully-grown wizard with\\na curly pig’s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers,\\nand Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay\\nfor its removal at a private hospital in London. It\\nwasn’t altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley\\nkept running his hand nervously over his backside,\\nand walking sideways from room to room, so as not to\\npresent the same target to the enemy.\\nLunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn’t even\\nprotest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery).\\nAunt Petunia wasn’t eating anything at all. Her arms\\nwere folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to\\nbe chewing her tongue, as though biting back the\\nfurious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“They’ll be driving, of course?” Uncle Vernon barked\\nacross the table.\\n“Er,” said Harry.\\nHe hadn’t thought of that. How were the Weasleys\\ngoing to pick him up? They didn’t have a car\\nanymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned\\nwas currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at\\nHogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry\\nof Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same\\ntoday?\\n“I think so,” said Harry.\\nUncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally,\\nUncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr. Weasley\\ndrove; he tended to judge other men by how big and\\nexpensive their cars were. But Harry doubted whether\\nUncle Vernon would have taken to Mr. Weasley even\\nif he drove a Ferrari.\\nHarry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he\\ncouldn’t stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out\\nthrough the net curtains every few seconds, as\\nthough there had been a warning about an escaped\\nrhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went\\nback downstairs and into the living room.\\nAunt Petunia was compulsively straightening\\ncushions. Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the\\npaper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry\\nwas sure he was really listening with all his might for\\nthe sound of an approaching car. Dudley was\\ncrammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath\\nhim, clamped firmly around his bottom. Harry\\ncouldn’t take the tension; he left the room and went\\nand sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nwatch and his heart pumping fast from excitement\\nand nerves.\\nBut five o’clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon,\\nperspiring slightly in his suit, opened the front door,\\npeered up and down the street, then withdrew his\\nhead quickly.\\n“They’re late!” he snarled at Harry.\\n“I know,” said Harry. “Maybe — er — the traffic’s bad,\\nor something.”\\nTen past five ... then a quarter past five ... Harry was\\nstarting to feel anxious himself now. At half past, he\\nheard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia conversing in\\nterse mutters in the living room.\\n“No consideration at all.”\\n“We might’ve had an engagement.”\\n“Maybe they think theyll get invited to dinner if\\nthey’re late.”\\n“Well, they most certainly won’t be,” said Uncle\\nVernon, and Harry heard him stand up and start\\npacing the living room. “They’ll take the boy and go,\\nthere 11 be no hanging around. That’s if they’re coming\\nat all. Probably mistaken the day. I daresay their kind\\ndon’t set much store by punctuality. Either that or\\nthey drive some tin-pot car that’s broken d —\\nAAAAAAAARRRRRGH ! ”\\nHarry jumped up. From the other side of the living\\nroom door came the sounds of the three Dursleys\\nscrambling, panic-stricken, across the room. Next\\nmoment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking\\nterrified.\\n \\n“What happened?” said Harry. “What’s the matter?”\\nBut Dudley didn’t seem able to speak. Hands still\\nclamped over his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he\\ncould into the kitchen. Harry hurried into the living\\nroom.\\nLoud hangings and scrapings were coming from\\nbehind the Dursleys’ boarded-up fireplace, which had\\na fake coal fire plugged in front of it.\\n“What is it?” gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed\\ninto the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the\\nfire. “What is it, Vernon?”\\nBut they were left in doubt barely a second longer.\\nVoices could be heard from inside the blocked\\nfireplace.\\n“Ouch! Fred, no — go back, go back, there’s been\\nsome kind of mistake — tell George not to — OUCH!\\nGeorge, no, there’s no room, go back quickly and tell\\nRon — ”\\n“Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad — maybe he’ll be able\\nto let us out — ”\\nThere was a loud hammering of fists on the boards\\nbehind the electric fire.\\n“Harry? Harry, can you hear us?”\\nThe Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry\\nwolverines.\\n“What is this?” growled Uncle Vernon. “What’s going\\non?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“They — they’ve tried to get here by Floo powder,”\\nsaid Harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh. “They can\\ntravel by fire — only you’ve blocked the fireplace —\\nhang on — ”\\nHe approached the fireplace and called through the\\nboards.\\n“Mr. Weasley? Can you hear me?”\\nThe hammering stopped. Somebody inside the\\nchimney piece said, “Shh!”\\n“Mr. Weasley, it’s Harry ... the fireplace has been\\nblocked up. You won’t be able to get through there.”\\n“Damn!” said Mr. Weasley’s voice. “What on earth did\\nthey want to block up the fireplace for?”\\n“They’ve got an electric fire,” Harry explained.\\n“Really?” said Mr. Weasley’s voice excitedly. “Eclectic,\\nyou say? With a plug? Gracious, I must see that. ...\\nLet’s think ... ouch, Ron!”\\nRon’s voice now joined the others’.\\n“What are we doing here? Has something gone\\nwrong?”\\n“Oh no, Ron,” came Fred’s voice, very sarcastically.\\n“No, this is exactly where we wanted to end up.”\\n“Yeah, we’re having the time of our lives here,” said\\nGeorge, whose voice sounded muffled, as though he\\nwas squashed against the wall.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Boys, boys ...” said Mr. Weasley vaguely. “I’m trying\\nto think what to do. ... Yes ... only way ... Stand back,\\nHarry.”\\nHarry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however,\\nmoved forward.\\n“Wait a moment!” he bellowed at the fire. “What\\nexactly are you going to — ”\\nBANG.\\nThe electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-\\nup fireplace burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley,\\nFred, George, and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose\\nchippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward\\nover the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before\\nshe hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the\\nWeasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including\\nFred and George, who were identical to the last\\nfreckle.\\n“That’s better,” panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust\\nfrom his long green robes and straightening his\\nglasses. “Ah — you must be Harry’s aunt and uncle!”\\nTall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle\\nVernon, his hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon\\nbacked away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia.\\nWords utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His best suit was\\ncovered in white dust, which had settled in his hair\\nand mustache and made him look as though he had\\njust aged thirty years.\\n“Er — yes — sorry about that,” said Mr. Weasley,\\nlowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at\\nthe blasted fireplace. “It’s all my fault. It just didn’t\\noccur to me that we wouldn’t be able to get out at the\\nother end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo\\n \\nNetwork, you see — just for an afternoon, you know,\\nso we could get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren’t\\nsupposed to be connected, strictly speaking — but\\nI’ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel\\nand he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy,\\nthough, don’t worry. I’ll light a fire to send the boys\\nback, and then I can repair your fireplace before I\\nDisapparate.”\\nHarry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn’t\\nunderstood a single word of this. They were still\\ngaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt Petunia\\nstaggered upright again and hid behind Uncle\\nVernon.\\n“Hello, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley brightly. “Got your\\ntrunk ready?”\\n“It’s upstairs,” said Harry, grinning back.\\n“Well get it,” said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he\\nand George left the room. They knew where Harry’s\\nbedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the\\ndead of night. Harry suspected that Fred and George\\nwere hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a\\nlot about him from Harry.\\n“Well,” said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly,\\nwhile he tried to find words to break the very nasty\\nsilence. “Very — erm — very nice place you’ve got\\nhere.”\\nAs the usually spotless living room was now covered\\nin dust and bits of brick, this remark didn’t go down\\ntoo well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon’s face\\npurpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing\\nher tongue again. However, they seemed too scared to\\nactually say anything.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nMr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything\\nto do with Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go\\nand examine the television and the video recorder.\\n“They run off eckeltricity, do they?” he said\\nknowledgeably. “Ah yes, I can see the plugs. I collect\\nplugs,” he added to Uncle Vernon. “And batteries. Got\\na very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I’m\\nmad, but there you are.”\\nUncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad\\ntoo. He moved ever so slightly to the right, screening\\nAunt Petunia from view, as though he thought Mr.\\nWeasley might suddenly run at them and attack.\\nDudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could\\nhear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew\\nthat the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen.\\nDudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley\\nwith terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal himself\\nbehind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle\\nVernon’s bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt\\nPetunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.\\n“Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?” said Mr.\\nWeasley, taking another brave stab at making\\nconversation.\\n“Yep,” said Harry, “that’s Dudley.”\\nHe and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly\\nlooked away from each other; the temptation to burst\\nout laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was\\nstill clutching his bottom as though afraid it might\\nfall off. Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely\\nconcerned at Dudley’s peculiar behavior. Indeed, from\\nthe tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was\\nquite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nas mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that\\nMr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.\\n“Having a good holiday, Dudley?” he said kindly.\\nDudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still\\nharder over his massive backside.\\nFred and George came back into the room carrying\\nHarry’s school trunk. They glanced around as they\\nentered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into\\nidentical evil grins.\\n“Ah, right,” said Mr. Weasley. “Better get cracking\\nthen.”\\nHe pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out\\nhis wand. Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against\\nthe wall as one.\\n“Incendio\\\\” said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the\\nhole in the wall behind him.\\nFlames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily\\nas though they had been burning for hours. Mr.\\nWeasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket,\\nuntied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and\\nthrew it onto the flames, which turned emerald green\\nand roared higher than ever.\\n“Off you go then, Fred,” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“Coming,” said Fred. “Oh no — hang on — ”\\nA bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred’s pocket and\\nthe contents were now rolling in every direction —\\nbig, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nFred scrambled around, cramming them back into his\\npocket, then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave,\\nstepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying\\n“the Burrow!” Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering\\ngasp. There was a whooshing sound, and Fred\\nvanished.\\n“Right then, George,” said Mr. Weasley, “you and the\\ntrunk.”\\nHarry helped George carry the trunk forward into the\\nflames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold\\nit better. Then, with a second whoosh, George had\\ncried “the Burrow!” and vanished too.\\n“Ron, you next,” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“See you,” said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He\\ngrinned broadly at Harry, then stepped into the fire,\\nshouted “the Burrow!” and disappeared.\\nNow Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.\\n“Well ... T>ye then,” Harry said to the Dursleys.\\nThey didn’t say anything at all. Harry moved toward\\nthe fire, but just as he reached the edge of the hearth,\\nMr. Weasley put out a hand and held him back. He\\nwas looking at the Dursleys in amazement.\\n“Harry said good-bye to you,” he said. “Didn’t you\\nhear him?”\\n“It doesn’t matter,” Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley.\\n“Honestly, I don’t care.”\\nMr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry’s\\nshoulder.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You aren’t going to see your nephew till next\\nsummer,” he said to Uncle Vernon in mild\\nindignation. “Surely you’re going to say good-bye?”\\nUncle Vernon’s face worked furiously. The idea of\\nbeing taught consideration by a man who had just\\nblasted away half his living room wall seemed to be\\ncausing him intense suffering. But Mr. Weasley’s\\nwand was still in his hand, and Uncle Vernon’s tiny\\neyes darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully,\\n“Good-bye, then.”\\n“See you,” said Harry, putting one foot forward into\\nthe green flames, which felt pleasantly like warm\\nbreath. At that moment, however, a horrible gagging\\nsound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started\\nto scream.\\nHarry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer\\nstanding behind his parents. He was kneeling beside\\nthe coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering\\non a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was\\nprotruding from his mouth. One bewildered second\\nlater, Harry realized that the foot-long thing was\\nDudley’s tongue — and that a brightly colored toffee\\nwrapper lay on the floor before him.\\nAunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside\\nDudley, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and\\nattempted to wrench it out of his mouth;\\nunsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse\\nthan ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle Vernon was\\nbellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr.\\nWeasley had to shout to make himself heard.\\n“Not to worry, I can sort him out!” he yelled,\\nadvancing on Dudley with his wand outstretched, but\\nAunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nherself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr.\\nWeasley.\\n“No, really!” said Mr. Weasley desperately. “It’s a\\nsimple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred —\\nreal practical joker — but it’s only an Engorgement\\nCharm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct\\nit — ”\\nBut far from being reassured, the Dursleys became\\nmore panic-stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing\\nhysterically, tugging Dudley’s tongue as though\\ndetermined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be\\nsuffocating under the combined pressure of his\\nmother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had\\nlost control completely, seized a china figure from on\\ntop of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr.\\nWeasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to\\nshatter in the blasted fireplace.\\n“Now really!” said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing\\nhis wand. “I’m trying to help\\\\”\\nBellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon\\nsnatched up another ornament.\\n“Harry, go! Just go!” Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand\\non Uncle Vernon. “I’ll sort this out!”\\nHarry didn’t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon’s\\nsecond ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on\\nbalance he thought it best to leave the situation to\\nMr. Weasley. He stepped into the fire, looking over his\\nshoulder as he said “the Burrow!” His last fleeting\\nglimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting\\na third ornament out of Uncle Vernon’s hand with his\\nwand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of\\nDudley, and Dudley’s tongue lolling around like a\\ngreat slimy python. But next moment Harry had\\n \\nbegun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys’ living room\\nwas whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green\\nflames.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n5\\nWEASLEYS’ WIZARD WHEEZES\\nHarry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to\\nhis sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until\\nhe started to feel sick and closed his eyes. Then,\\nwhen at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw\\nout his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent\\nhimself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys’\\nkitchen fire.\\n“Did he eat it?” said Fred excitedly, holding out a\\nhand to pull Harry to his feet.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, straightening up. “What was it?”\\n“Ton-Tongue Toffee,” said Fred brightly. “George and I\\ninvented them, and we’ve been looking for someone to\\ntest them on all summer. ...”\\nThe tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked\\naround and saw that Ron and George were sitting at\\nthe scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people\\nHarry had never seen before, though he knew\\n \\nimmediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the\\ntwo eldest Weasley brothers.\\n“How’re you doing, Harry?” said the nearer of the two,\\ngrinning at him and holding out a large hand, which\\nHarry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his\\nfingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with\\ndragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins,\\nshorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were\\nboth long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured\\nface, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he\\nlooked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and\\none of them had a large, shiny burn on it.\\nBill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry’s\\nhand. Bill came as something of a surprise. Harry\\nknew that he worked for the wizarding bank,\\nGringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at\\nHogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an\\nolder version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and\\nfond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was —\\nthere was no other word for it — cool. He was tall,\\nwith long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He\\nwas wearing an earring with what looked like a fang\\ndangling from it. Bill’s clothes would not have looked\\nout of place at a rock concert, except that Harry\\nrecognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of\\ndragon hide.\\nBefore any of them could say anything else, there was\\na faint popping noise, and Mr. Weasley appeared out\\nof thin air at George’s shoulder. He was looking\\nangrier than Harry had ever seen him.\\n“That wasn’t funny, Fred!” he shouted. “What on\\nearth did you give that Muggle boy?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I didn’t give him anything,” said Fred, with another\\nevil grin. “I just dropped it. ... It was his fault he went\\nand ate it, I never told him to.”\\n“You dropped it on purpose!” roared Mr. Weasley.\\n“You knew he’d eat it, you knew he was on a diet — ”\\n“How big did his tongue get?” George asked eagerly.\\n“It was four feet long before his parents would let me\\nshrink it!”\\nHarry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again.\\n“It isn’t funny\\\\” Mr. Weasley shouted. “That sort of\\nbehavior seriously undermines wizard-Muggle\\nrelations! I spend half my life campaigning against the\\nmistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons — ”\\n“We didn’t give it to him because he’s a Muggle!” said\\nFred indignantly.\\n“No, we gave it to him because he’s a great bullying\\ngit,” said George. “Isn’t he, Harry?”\\n“Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry earnestly.\\n“That’s not the point!” raged Mr. Weasley. “You wait\\nuntil I tell your mother — ”\\n“Tell me what?” said a voice behind them.\\nMrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a\\nshort, plump woman with a very kind face, though\\nher eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion.\\n“Oh hello, Harry, dear,” she said, spotting him and\\nsmiling. Then her eyes snapped back to her husband.\\n“Tell me what , Arthur?”\\n \\nMr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however\\nangry he was with Fred and George, he hadn’t really\\nintended to tell Mrs. Weasley what had happened.\\nThere was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife\\nnervously. Then two girls appeared in the kitchen\\ndoorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One, with very bushy\\nbrown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry’s\\nand Ron’s friend, Hermione Granger. The other, who\\nwas small and red-haired, was Ron’s younger sister,\\nGinny. Both of them smiled at Harry, who grinned\\nback, which made Ginny go scarlet — she had been\\nvery taken with Harry ever since his first visit to the\\nBurrow.\\n“Tell me what, Arthur?” Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a\\ndangerous sort of voice.\\n“It’s nothing, Molly,” mumbled Mr. Weasley, “Fred and\\nGeorge just — but I’ve had words with them — ”\\n“What have they done this time?” said Mrs. Weasley.\\n“If it’s got anything to do with Weasleys’ Wizard\\nWheezes — ”\\n“Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping,\\nRon?” said Hermione from the doorway.\\n“He knows where he’s sleeping,” said Ron, “in my\\nroom, he slept there last — ”\\n“We can all go,” said Hermione pointedly.\\n“Oh,” said Ron, cottoning on. “Right.”\\n“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.\\n“You stay where you are!” snarled Mrs. Weasley.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they,\\nHermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway\\nand up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through\\nthe house to the upper stories.\\n“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked\\nas they climbed.\\nRon and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione\\ndidn’t.\\n“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was\\ncleaning Fred and George’s room,” said Ron quietly.\\n“Great long price lists for stuff they’ve invented. Joke\\nstuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads\\nof stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they’d been\\ninventing all that ...”\\n“We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for\\nages, but we never thought they were actually making\\nthings,” said Ginny. “We thought they just liked the\\nnoise.”\\n“Only, most of the stuff — well, all of it, really — was\\na bit dangerous,” said Ron, “and, you know, they were\\nplanning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money,\\nand Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren’t\\nallowed to make any more of it, and burned all the\\norder forms. ... She’s furious at them anyway. They\\ndidn’t get as many O.W.L.s as she expected.”\\nO.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the\\nexaminations Hogwarts students took at the age of\\nfifteen.\\n“And then there was this big row,” Ginny said,\\n“because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of\\nMagic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do\\nis open a joke shop.”\\n \\nJust then a door on the second landing opened, and a\\nface poked out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a\\nvery annoyed expression.\\n“Hi, Percy,” said Harry.\\n“Oh hello, Harry,” said Percy. “I was wondering who\\nwas making all the noise. I’m trying to work in here,\\nyou know — I’ve got a report to finish for the office —\\nand it’s rather difficult to concentrate when people\\nkeep thundering up and down the stairs.”\\n“We’re not thundering,” said Ron irritably. “We’re\\nwalking. Sorry if we’ve disturbed the top-secret\\nworkings of the Ministry of Magic.”\\n“What are you working on?” said Harry.\\n“A report for the Department of International Magical\\nCooperation,” said Percy smugly. “We’re trying to\\nstandardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign\\nimports are just a shade too thin — leakages have\\nbeen increasing at a rate of almost three percent a\\nyear — ”\\n“That’ll change the world, that report will,” said Ron.\\n“Front page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron\\nleaks.”\\nPercy went slightly pink.\\n“You might sneer, Ron,” he said heatedly, “but unless\\nsome sort of international law is imposed we might\\nwell find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-\\nbottomed products that seriously endanger — ”\\n“Yeah, yeah, all right,” said Ron, and he started off\\nupstairs again. Percy slammed his bedroom door\\nshut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up\\n \\nthree more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen\\nbelow echoed up to them. It sounded as though Mr.\\nWeasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the toffees.\\nThe room at the top of the house where Ron slept\\nlooked much as it had the last time that Harry had\\ncome to stay: the same posters of Ron’s favorite\\nQuidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling\\nand waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the\\nfish tank on the windowsill, which had previously\\nheld frog spawn, now contained one extremely large\\nfrog. Ron’s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but\\ninstead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered\\nRon’s letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping\\nup and down in a small cage and twittering madly.\\n“Shut up, Pig,” said Ron, edging his way between two\\nof the four beds that had been squeezed into the\\nroom. “Fred and George are in here with us, because\\nBill and Charlie are in their room,” he told Harry.\\n“Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because\\nhe’s got to work.”\\n“Er — why are you calling that owl Pig?” Harry asked\\nRon.\\n“Because he’s being stupid,” said Ginny. “Its proper\\nname is Pigwidgeon.”\\n“Yeah, and that’s not a stupid name at all,” said Ron\\nsarcastically. “Ginny named him,” he explained to\\nHarry. “She reckons it’s sweet. And I tried to change\\nit, but it was too late, he won’t answer to anything\\nelse. So now he’s Pig. I’ve got to keep him up here\\nbecause he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me\\ntoo, come to that.”\\nPigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting\\nshrilly. Harry knew Ron too well to take him\\n \\nseriously. He had moaned continually about his old\\nrat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when\\nHermione’s cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten\\nhim.\\n“Where’s Crookshanks?” Harry asked Hermione now.\\n“Out in the garden, I expect,” she said. “He likes\\nchasing gnomes. He’s never seen any before.”\\n“Percy’s enjoying work, then?” said Harry, sitting\\ndown on one of the beds and watching the Chudley\\nCannons zooming in and out of the posters on the\\nceiling.\\n“Enjoying it?” said Ron darkly. “I don’t reckon he’d\\ncome home if Dad didn’t make him. He’s obsessed.\\nJust don’t get him onto the subject of his boss.\\nAccording to Mr. Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr.\\nCrouch . . . Mr. Crouch is of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch\\nwas telling me ... They 11 be announcing their\\nengagement any day now.”\\n“Have you had a good summer, Harry?” said\\nHermione. “Did you get our food parcels and\\neverything?”\\n“Yeah, thanks a lot,” said Harry. “They saved my life,\\nthose cakes.”\\n“And have you heard from — ?” Ron began, but at a\\nlook from Hermione he fell silent. Harry knew Ron\\nhad been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and\\nHermione had been so deeply involved in helping\\nSirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they\\nwere almost as concerned about Harry’s godfather as\\nhe was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny\\nwas a bad idea. Nobody but themselves and Professor\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nDumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or\\nbelieved in his innocence.\\n“I think they’ve stopped arguing,” said Hermione, to\\ncover the awkward moment, because Ginny was\\nlooking curiously from Ron to Harry. “Shall we go\\ndown and help your mum with dinner?”\\n“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. The four of them left Ron’s\\nroom and went back downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley\\nalone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad-tempered.\\n“We’re eating out in the garden,” she said when they\\ncame in. “There’s just not room for eleven people in\\nhere. Could you take the plates outside, girls? Bill\\nand Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and\\nforks, please, you two,” she said to Ron and Harry,\\npointing her wand a little more vigorously than she\\nhad intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which\\nshot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off\\nthe walls and ceiling.\\n“Oh for heaven’s sake,” she snapped, now directing\\nher wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the\\nsideboard and started skating across the floor,\\nscooping up the potatoes. “Those two!” she burst out\\nsavagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a\\ncupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and\\nGeorge. “I don’t know what’s going to happen to them,\\nI really don’t. No ambition, unless you count making\\nas much trouble as they possibly can. ...”\\nMrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down\\non the kitchen table and began to wave her wand\\naround inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the\\nwand tip as she stirred.\\n“It’s not as though they haven’t got brains,” she\\ncontinued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the\\n \\nstove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand,\\n“but they’re wasting them, and unless they pull\\nthemselves together soon, they’ll be in real trouble.\\nI’ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than\\nthe rest put together. If they carry on the way they’re\\ngoing, they’ll end up in front of the Improper Use of\\nMagic Office.”\\nMrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer,\\nwhich shot open. Harry and Ron both jumped out of\\nthe way as several knives soared out of it, flew across\\nthe kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which\\nhad just been tipped back into the sink by the\\ndustpan.\\n“I don’t know where we went wrong with them,” said\\nMrs. Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to\\npull out still more saucepans. “It’s been the same for\\nyears, one thing after another, and they won’t listen\\nto — OH NOT AGAIN.”\\nShe had picked up her wand from the table, and it\\nhad emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant\\nrubber mouse.\\n“One of their fake wands again!” she shouted. “How\\nmany times have I told them not to leave them lying\\naround?”\\nShe grabbed her real wand and turned around to find\\nthat the sauce on the stove was smoking.\\n“C’mon,” Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a\\nhandful of cutlery from the open drawer, “let’s go and\\nhelp Bill and Charlie.”\\nThey left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door\\ninto the yard.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThey had only gone a few paces when Hermione’s\\nbandy-legged ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting\\nout of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the\\nair, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs.\\nHarry recognized it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten\\ninches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it\\nsprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one\\nof the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the\\ndoor. Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as\\nCrookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to\\nreach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was\\ncoming from the other side of the house. The source\\nof the commotion was revealed as they entered the\\ngarden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their\\nwands out, and were making two battered old tables\\nfly high above the lawn, smashing into each other,\\neach attempting to knock the other’s out of the air.\\nFred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing,\\nand Hermione was hovering near the hedge,\\napparently torn between amusement and anxiety.\\nBill’s table caught Charlie’s with a huge bang and\\nknocked one of its legs off. There was a clatter from\\noverhead, and they all looked up to see Percy’s head\\npoking out of a window on the second floor.\\n“Will you keep it down?!” he bellowed.\\n“Sorry, Perce,” said Bill, grinning. “How’re the\\ncauldron bottoms coming on?”\\n“Very badly,” said Percy peevishly, and he slammed\\nthe window shut. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed\\nthe tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then,\\nwith a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg\\nand conjured tablecloths from nowhere.\\nBy seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under\\ndishes and dishes of Mrs. Weasley’s excellent cooking,\\n \\nand the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were\\nsettling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-\\nblue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals\\nof increasingly stale cake all summer, this was\\nparadise, and at first, Harry listened rather than\\ntalked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie,\\nboiled potatoes, and salad.\\nAt the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father\\nall about his report on cauldron bottoms.\\n“I’ve told Mr. Crouch that I’ll have it ready by\\nTuesday,” Percy was saying pompously. “That’s a bit\\nsooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of\\nthings. I think he’ll be grateful I’ve done it in good\\ntime, I mean, it’s extremely busy in our department\\njust now, what with all the arrangements for the\\nWorld Cup. We’re just not getting the support we\\nneed from the Department of Magical Games and\\nSports. Ludo Bagman — ”\\n“I like Ludo,” said Mr. Weasley mildly. “He was the\\none who got us such good tickets for the Cup. I did\\nhim a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into a spot\\nof trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I\\nsmoothed the whole thing over.”\\n“Oh Bagman’s likable enough, of course,” said Percy\\ndismissively, “but how he ever got to be Head of\\nDepartment ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch! I\\ncan’t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our\\ndepartment and not trying to find out what’s\\nhappened to them. You realize Bertha Jorkins has\\nbeen missing for over a month now? Went on holiday\\nto Albania and never came back?”\\n“Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,” said Mr.\\nWeasley, frowning. “He says Bertha’s gotten lost\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nplenty of times before now — though I must say, if it\\nwas someone in my department, I’d be worried. ...”\\n“Oh Bertha’s hopeless, all right,” said Percy. “I hear\\nshe’s been shunted from department to department\\nfor years, much more trouble than she’s worth ... but\\nall the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find her.\\nMr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest, she\\nworked in our department at one time, you know, and\\nI think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but\\nBagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably\\nmisread the map and ended up in Australia instead of\\nAlbania. However” — Percy heaved an impressive sigh\\nand took a deep swig of elderflower wine — “we’ve got\\nquite enough on our plates at the Department of\\nInternational Magical Cooperation without trying to\\nfind members of other departments too. As you know,\\nwe’ve got another big event to organize right after the\\nWorld Cup.”\\nPercy cleared his throat significantly and looked down\\ntoward the end of the table where Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione were sitting. “ You know the one I’m talking\\nabout, Father.” He raised his voice slightly. “The top-\\nsecret one.”\\nRon rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and\\nHermione, “He’s been trying to get us to ask what that\\nevent is ever since he started work. Probably an\\nexhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.”\\nIn the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing\\nwith Bill about his earring, which seemed to be a\\nrecent acquisition.\\n“... with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what\\ndo they say at the bank?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress\\nas long as I bring home plenty of treasure,” said Bill\\npatiently.\\n“And your hair’s getting silly, dear,” said Mrs.\\nWeasley, fingering her wand lovingly. “I wish you’d let\\nme give it a trim. ...”\\n“I like it,” said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill.\\n“You’re so old-fashioned, Mum. Anyway, it’s nowhere\\nnear as long as Professor Dumbledore’s. ...”\\nNext to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were\\nall talking spiritedly about the World Cup.\\n“It’s got to be Ireland,” said Charlie thickly, through a\\nmouthful of potato. “They flattened Peru in the\\nsemifinals.”\\n“Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,” said Fred.\\n“Krum’s one decent player, Ireland has got seven,”\\nsaid Charlie shortly. “I wish England had got through.\\nThat was embarrassing, that was.”\\n“What happened?” said Harry eagerly, regretting more\\nthan ever his isolation from the wizarding world when\\nhe was stuck on Privet Drive.\\n“Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and\\nninety to ten,” said Charlie gloomily. “Shocking\\nperformance. And Wales lost to Uganda, and Scotland\\nwas slaughtered by Luxembourg.”\\nHarry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch\\nteam ever since his first year at Hogwarts and owned\\none of the best racing brooms in the world, a Firebolt.\\nFlying came more naturally to Harry than anything\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nelse in the magical world, and he played in the\\nposition of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.\\nMr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the\\ndarkening garden before they had their homemade\\nstrawberry ice cream, and by the time they had\\nfinished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and\\nthe warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass\\nand honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed\\nand at peace with the world as he watched several\\ngnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing\\nmadly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.\\nRon looked carefully up the table to check that the\\nrest of the family were all busy talking, then he said\\nvery quietly to Harry, “So — have you heard from\\nSirius lately?”\\nHermione looked around, listening closely.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry softly, “twice. He sounds okay. I\\nwrote to him yesterday. He might write back while I’m\\nhere.”\\nHe suddenly remembered the reason he had written\\nto Sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling\\nRon and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and\\nabout the dream that had awoken him . . . but he\\nreally didn’t want to worry them just now, not when\\nhe himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.\\n“Look at the time,” Mrs. Weasley said suddenly,\\nchecking her wristwatch. “You really should be in\\nbed, the whole lot of you — you’ll be up at the crack\\nof dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your\\nschool list out, I’ll get your things for you tomorrow in\\nDiagon Alley. I’m getting everyone else’s. There might\\nnot be time after the World Cup, the match went on\\nfor five days last time.”\\n \\n“Wow — hope it does this time!” said Harry\\nenthusiastically.\\n“Well, I certainly don’t,” said Percy sanctimoniously. “I\\nshudder to think what the state of my in-tray would\\nbe if I was away from work for five days.”\\n“Yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again,\\neh, Perce?” said Fred.\\n“That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!” said\\nPercy, going very red in the face. “It was nothing\\npersonall”\\n“It was,” Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from\\nthe table. “We sent it.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE PORTKEY\\nHarry felt as though he had barely lain down to sleep\\nin Ron’s room when he was being shaken awake by\\nMrs. Weasley.\\n“Time to go, Harry, dear,” she whispered, moving\\naway to wake Ron.\\nHarry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and\\nsat up. It was still dark outside. Ron muttered\\nindistinctly as his mother roused him. At the foot of\\nHarry’s mattress he saw two large, disheveled shapes\\nemerging from tangles of blankets.\\n“ ’S’ time already?” said Fred groggily.\\nThey dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then,\\nyawning and stretching, the four of them headed\\ndownstairs into the kitchen.\\nMrs. Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot\\non the stove, while Mr. Weasley was sitting at the\\ntable, checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets. He\\n \\nlooked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so\\nthat they could see his clothes more clearly. He was\\nwearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a\\nvery old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held\\nup with a thick leather belt.\\n“What d’you think?” he asked anxiously. “We’re\\nsupposed to go incognito — do I look like a Muggle,\\nHarry?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, smiling, “very good.”\\n“Where ’re Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?” said\\nGeorge, failing to stifle a huge yawn.\\n“Well, they’re Apparating, aren’t they?” said Mrs.\\nWeasley, heaving the large pot over to the table and\\nstarting to ladle porridge into bowls. “So they can\\nhave a bit of a lie-in.”\\nHarry knew that Apparating meant disappearing from\\none place and reappearing almost instantly in\\nanother, but had never known any Hogwarts student\\nto do it, and understood that it was very difficult.\\n“So they’re still in bed?” said Fred grumpily, pulling\\nhis bowl of porridge toward him. “Why can’t we\\nApparate too?”\\n“Because you’re not of age and you haven’t passed\\nyour test,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “And where have\\nthose girls got to?”\\nShe bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her\\nclimbing the stairs.\\n“You have to pass a test to Apparate?” Harry asked.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Oh yes,” said Mr. Weasley, tucking the tickets safely\\ninto the back pocket of his jeans. “The Department of\\nMagical Transportation had to fine a couple of people\\nthe other day for Apparating without a license. It’s not\\neasy, Apparition, and when it’s not done properly it\\ncan lead to nasty complications. This pair I’m talking\\nabout went and splinched themselves.”\\nEveryone around the table except Harry winced.\\n“Er — splinched?” said Harry.\\n“They left half of themselves behind,” said Mr.\\nWeasley, now spooning large amounts of treacle onto\\nhis porridge. “So, of course, they were stuck. Couldn’t\\nmove either way. Had to wait for the Accidental Magic\\nReversal Squad to sort them out. Meant a fair old bit\\nof paperwork, I can tell you, what with the Muggles\\nwho spotted the body parts they’d left behind. ...”\\nHarry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an\\neyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of Privet\\nDrive.\\n“Were they okay?” he asked, startled.\\n“Oh yes,” said Mr. Weasley matter-of-factly. “But they\\ngot a heavy fine, and I don’t think they’ll be trying it\\nagain in a hurry. You don’t mess around with\\nApparition. There are plenty of adult wizards who\\ndon’t bother with it. Prefer brooms — slower, but\\nsafer.”\\n“But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?”\\n“Charlie had to take the test twice,” said Fred,\\ngrinning. “He failed the first time, Apparated five\\nmiles south of where he meant to, right on top of\\nsome poor old dear doing her shopping, remember?”\\n \\n“Yes, well, he passed the second time,” said Mrs.\\nWeasley, marching back into the kitchen amid hearty\\nsniggers.\\n“Percy only passed two weeks ago,” said George. “He’s\\nbeen Apparating downstairs every morning since, just\\nto prove he can.”\\nThere were footsteps down the passageway and\\nHermione and Ginny came into the kitchen, both\\nlooking pale and drowsy.\\n“Why do we have to be up so early?” Ginny said,\\nrubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table.\\n“We’ve got a bit of a walk,” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“Walk?” said Harry. “What, are we walking to the\\nWorld Cup?”\\n“No, no, that’s miles away,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling.\\n“We only need to walk a short way. It’s just that it’s\\nvery difficult for a large number of wizards to\\ncongregate without attracting Muggle attention. We\\nhave to be very careful about how we travel at the\\nbest of times, and on a huge occasion like the\\nQuidditch World Cup — ”\\n“George!” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, and they all\\njumped.\\n“What?” said George, in an innocent tone that\\ndeceived nobody.\\n“What is that in your pocket?”\\n“Nothing!”\\n“Don’t you lie to me!”\\n \\nMrs. Weasley pointed her wand at George’s pocket\\nand said, “Acciol”\\nSeveral small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of\\nGeorge’s pocket; he made a grab for them but missed,\\nand they sped right into Mrs. Weasley ’s outstretched\\nhand.\\n“We told you to destroy them!” said Mrs. Weasley\\nfuriously, holding up what were unmistakably more\\nTon-Tongue Toffees. “We told you to get rid of the lot!\\nEmpty your pockets, go on, both of you!”\\nIt was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently\\nbeen trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the\\nhouse as possible, and it was only by using her\\nSummoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed to\\nfind them all.\\n“Acciol Acciol Acciol” she shouted, and toffees zoomed\\nfrom all sorts of unlikely places, including the lining\\nof George’s jacket and the turn-ups of Fred’s jeans.\\n“We spent six months developing those!” Fred\\nshouted at his mother as she threw the toffees away.\\n“Oh a fine way to spend six months!” she shrieked.\\n“No wonder you didn’t get more O.W.L.s!”\\nAll in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as\\nthey took their departure. Mrs. Weasley was still\\nglowering as she kissed Mr. Weasley on the cheek,\\nthough not nearly as much as the twins, who had\\neach hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and\\nwalked out without a word to her.\\n“Well, have a lovely time,” said Mrs. Weasley, “and\\nbehave yourselves,” she called after the twins’\\nretreating backs, but they did not look back or\\n \\nanswer. “I’ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along\\naround midday,” Mrs. Weasley said to Mr. Weasley, as\\nhe, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny set off across\\nthe dark yard after Fred and George.\\nIt was chilly and the moon was still out. Only a dull,\\ngreenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed\\nthat daybreak was drawing closer. Harry, having been\\nthinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward\\nthe Quidditch World Cup, sped up to walk with Mr.\\nWeasley.\\n“So how does everyone get there without all the\\nMuggles noticing?” he asked.\\n“It’s been a massive organizational problem,” sighed\\nMr. Weasley. “The trouble is, about a hundred\\nthousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of\\ncourse, we just haven’t got a magical site big enough\\nto accommodate them all. There are places Muggles\\ncan’t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred\\nthousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine\\nand three-quarters. So we had to find a nice deserted\\nmoor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as\\npossible. The whole Ministry’s been working on it for\\nmonths. First, of course, we have to stagger the\\narrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive\\ntwo weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle\\ntransport, but we can’t have too many clogging up\\ntheir buses and trains — remember, wizards are\\ncoming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of\\ncourse, but we have to set up safe points for them to\\nappear, well away from Muggles. I believe there’s a\\nhandy wood they’re using as the Apparition point. For\\nthose who don’t want to Apparate, or can’t, we use\\nPortkeys. They’re objects that are used to transport\\nwizards from one spot to another at a prearranged\\ntime. You can do large groups at a time if you need to.\\nThere have been two hundred Portkeys placed at\\n \\nstrategic points around Britain, and the nearest one\\nto us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that’s\\nwhere we’re headed.”\\nMr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large\\nblack mass rose beyond the village of Ottery St.\\nCatchpole.\\n“What sort of objects are Portkeys?” said Harry\\ncuriously.\\n“Well, they can be anything,” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“Unobtrusive things, obviously, so Muggles don’t go\\npicking them up and playing with them . . . stuff they’ll\\njust think is litter. ...”\\nThey trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the\\nvillage, the silence broken only by their footsteps. The\\nsky lightened very slowly as they made their way\\nthrough the village, its inky blackness diluting to\\ndeepest blue. Harry’s hands and feet were freezing.\\nMr. Weasley kept checking his watch.\\nThey didn’t have breath to spare for talking as they\\nbegan to climb Stoatshead Hill, stumbling\\noccasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick\\nblack tuffets of grass. Each breath Harry took was\\nsharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize\\nup when, at last, his feet found level ground.\\n“Whew,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking off his glasses\\nand wiping them on his sweater. “Well, we’ve made\\ngood time — we’ve got ten minutes. ...”\\nHermione came over the crest of the hill last,\\nclutching a stitch in her side.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Now we just need the Portkey,” said Mr. Weasley,\\nreplacing his glasses and squinting around at the\\nground. “It won’t be big. ... Come on ...”\\nThey spread out, searching. They had only been at it\\nfor a couple of minutes, however, when a shout rent\\nthe still air.\\n“Over here, Arthur! Over here, son, we’ve got it!”\\nTwo tall figures were silhouetted against the starry\\nsky on the other side of the hilltop.\\n“Amos!” said Mr. Weasley, smiling as he strode over to\\nthe man who had shouted. The rest of them followed.\\nMr. Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy-faced\\nwizard with a scrubby brown beard, who was holding\\na moldy-looking old boot in his other hand.\\n“This is Amos Diggory, everyone,” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“He works for the Department for the Regulation and\\nControl of Magical Creatures. And I think you know\\nhis son, Cedric?”\\nCedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of\\naround seventeen. He was Captain and Seeker of the\\nHufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.\\n“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all.\\nEverybody said hi back except Fred and George, who\\nmerely nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric\\nfor beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first\\nQuidditch match of the previous year.\\n“Long walk, Arthur?” Cedric’s father asked.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley. “We live just on the\\nother side of the village there. You?”\\n“Had to get up at two, didn’t we, Ced? I tell you, I’ll be\\nglad when he’s got his Apparition test. Still ... not\\ncomplaining ... Quidditch World Cup, wouldn’t miss it\\nfor a sackful of Galleons — and the tickets cost about\\nthat. Mind you, looks like I got off easy. ...” Amos\\nDiggory peered good-naturedly around at the three\\nWeasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny. “All these\\nyours, Arthur?”\\n“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley,\\npointing out his children. “This is Hermione, friend of\\nRon’s — and Harry, another friend — ”\\n“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes\\nwidening. “Harry? Harry Potter?”\\n“Er — yeah,” said Harry.\\nHarry was used to people looking curiously at him\\nwhen they met him, used to the way their eyes moved\\nat once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it\\nalways made him feel uncomfortable.\\n“Ced’s talked about you, of course,” said Amos\\nDiggory. “Told us all about playing against you last\\nyear. ... I said to him, I said — Ced, that’ll be\\nsomething to tell your grandchildren, that will. ... You\\nbeat Harry Potterl”\\nHarry couldn’t think of any reply to this, so he\\nremained silent. Fred and George were both scowling\\nagain. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.\\n“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered. “I told\\nyou ... it was an accident. ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos\\ngenially, slapping his son on his back. “Always\\nmodest, our Ced, always the gentleman ... but the\\nbest man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same,\\nwouldn’t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays\\non, you don’t need to be a genius to tell which one’s\\nthe better flier!”\\n“Must be nearly time,” said Mr. Weasley quickly,\\npulling out his watch again. “Do you know whether\\nwe’re waiting for any more, Amos?”\\n“No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already\\nand the Fawcetts couldn’t get tickets,” said Mr.\\nDiggory. “There aren’t any more of us in this area, are\\nthere?”\\n“Not that I know of,” said Mr. Weasley. “Yes, it’s a\\nminute off. ... We’d better get ready. ...”\\nHe looked around at Harry and Hermione.\\n“You just need to touch the Portkey, that’s all, a\\nfinger will do — ”\\nWith difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the\\nnine of them crowded around the old boot held out by\\nAmos Diggory.\\nThey all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze\\nswept over the hilltop. Nobody spoke. It suddenly\\noccurred to Harry how odd this would look if a\\nMuggle were to walk up here now ... nine people, two\\nof them grown men, clutching this manky old boot in\\nthe semidarkness, waiting. ...\\n“Three ...” muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his\\nwatch, “two ... one ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nIt happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook\\njust behind his navel had been suddenly jerked\\nirresistibly forward. His feet left the ground; he could\\nfeel Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their\\nshoulders banging into his; they were all speeding\\nforward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his\\nforefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was\\npulling him magnetically onward and then —\\nHis feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into\\nhim and he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near\\nhis head with a heavy thud.\\nHarry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and\\nCedric were still standing, though looking very\\nwindswept; everybody else was on the ground.\\n“Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,” said a voice.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n7\\nBAGMAN AND CROUCH\\nHarry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his\\nfeet. They had arrived on what appeared to be a\\ndeserted stretch of misty moor. In front of them was a\\npair of tired and grumpy-looking wizards, one of\\nwhom was holding a large gold watch, the other a\\nthick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed\\nas Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the\\nwatch wore a tweed suit with thigh-length galoshes;\\nhis colleague, a kilt and a poncho.\\n“Morning, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, picking up the\\nboot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it\\ninto a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry\\ncould see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can,\\nand a punctured football.\\n“Hello there, Arthur,” said Basil wearily. “Not on duty,\\neh? It’s all right for some. ... We’ve been here all\\nnight. ... You’d better get out of the way, we’ve got a\\nbig party coming in from the Black Forest at five-\\nfifteen. Hang on, I’ll find your campsite. ... Weasley ...\\nWeasley ...” He consulted his parchment list. “About a\\n \\nquarter of a mile’s walk over there, first field you\\ncome to. Site manager’s called Mr. Roberts. Diggory ...\\nsecond field ... ask for Mr. Payne.”\\n“Thanks, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, and he beckoned\\neveryone to follow him.\\nThey set off across the deserted moor, unable to make\\nout much through the mist. After about twenty\\nminutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam\\ninto view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the\\nghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents,\\nrising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a\\ndark wood on the horizon. They said good-bye to the\\nDiggorys and approached the cottage door.\\nA man was standing in the doorway, looking out at\\nthe tents. Harry knew at a glance that this was the\\nonly real Muggle for several acres. When he heard\\ntheir footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.\\n“Morning!” said Mr. Weasley brightly.\\n“Morning,” said the Muggle.\\n“Would you be Mr. Roberts?”\\n“Aye, I would,” said Mr. Roberts. “And who’re you?”\\n“Weasley — two tents, booked a couple of days ago?”\\n“Aye,” said Mr. Roberts, consulting a list tacked to the\\ndoor. “You’ve got a space up by the wood there. Just\\nthe one night?”\\n“That’s it,” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“You’ll be paying now, then?” said Mr. Roberts.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Ah — right — certainly — ” said Mr. Weasley. He\\nretreated a short distance from the cottage and\\nbeckoned Harry toward him. “Help me, Harry,” he\\nmuttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money from his\\npocket and starting to peel the notes apart. “This\\none’s a — a — a ten? Ah yes, I see the little number\\non it now. ... So this is a five?”\\n“A twenty,” Harry corrected him in an undertone,\\nuncomfortably aware of Mr. Roberts trying to catch\\nevery word.\\n“Ah yes, so it is. ... I don’t know, these little bits of\\npaper ...”\\n“You foreign?” said Mr. Roberts as Mr. Weasley\\nreturned with the correct notes.\\n“Foreign?” repeated Mr. Weasley, puzzled.\\n“You’re not the first one who’s had trouble with\\nmoney,” said Mr. Roberts, scrutinizing Mr. Weasley\\nclosely. “I had two try and pay me with great gold\\ncoins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago.”\\n“Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley nervously.\\nMr. Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some\\nchange.\\n“Never been this crowded,” he said suddenly, looking\\nout over the misty field again. “Hundreds of pre-\\nbookings. People usually just turn up. ...”\\n“Is that right?” said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out\\nfor his change, but Mr. Roberts didn’t give it to him.\\n“Aye,” he said thoughtfully. “People from all over.\\nLoads of foreigners. And not just foreigners. Weirdos,\\n \\nyou know? There’s a bloke walking ’round in a kilt\\nand a poncho.”\\n“Shouldn’t he?” said Mr. Weasley anxiously.\\n“It’s like some sort of ... I dunno ... like some sort of\\nrally,” said Mr. Roberts. “They all seem to know each\\nother. Like a big party.”\\nAt that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out\\nof thin air next to Mr. Roberts’s front door.\\n“Obliviate\\\\” he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr.\\nRoberts.\\nInstantly, Mr. Roberts’s eyes slid out of focus, his\\nbrows unknitted, and a look of dreamy unconcern fell\\nover his face. Harry recognized the symptoms of one\\nwho had just had his memory modified.\\n“A map of the campsite for you,” Mr. Roberts said\\nplacidly to Mr. Weasley. “And your change.”\\n“Thanks very much,” said Mr. Weasley.\\nThe wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward\\nthe gate to the campsite. He looked exhausted: His\\nchin was blue with stubble and there were deep\\npurple shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot\\nof Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr. Weasley, “Been\\nhaving a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory\\nCharm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo\\nBagman’s not helping. Trotting around talking about\\nBludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a\\nworry about anti-Muggle security. Blimey, I’ll be glad\\nwhen this is over. See you later, Arthur.”\\nHe Disapparated.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games\\nand Sports,” said Ginny, looking surprised. “He\\nshould know better than to talk about Bludgers near\\nMuggles, shouldn’t he?”\\n“He should,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading\\nthem through the gates into the campsite, “but Ludo’s\\nalways been a bit ... well ... lax about security. You\\ncouldn’t wish for a more enthusiastic head of the\\nsports department though. He played Quidditch for\\nEngland himself, you know. And he was the best\\nBeater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had.”\\nThey trudged up the misty field between long rows of\\ntents. Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had\\nclearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible,\\nbut had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls,\\nor weather vanes. However, here and there was a tent\\nso obviously magical that Harry could hardly be\\nsurprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious.\\nHalfway up the field stood an extravagant confection\\nof striped silk like a miniature palace, with several\\nlive peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little farther\\non they passed a tent that had three floors and\\nseveral turrets; and a short way beyond that was a\\ntent that had a front garden attached, complete with\\nbirdbath, sundial, and fountain.\\n“Always the same,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling. “We\\ncan’t resist showing off when we get together. Ah,\\nhere we are, look, this is us.”\\nThey had reached the very edge of the wood at the top\\nof the field, and here was an empty space, with a\\nsmall sign hammered into the ground that read\\nWEEZLY.\\n“Couldn’t have a better spot!” said Mr. Weasley\\nhappily. “The field is just on the other side of the\\n \\nwood there, we’re as close as we could be.” He hoisted\\nhis backpack from his shoulders. “Right,” he said\\nexcitedly, “no magic allowed, strictly speaking, not\\nwhen we’re out in these numbers on Muggle land.\\nWe’ll be putting these tents up by hand! Shouldn’t be\\ntoo difficult. ... Muggles do it all the time. ... Here,\\nHarry, where do you reckon we should start?”\\nHarry had never been camping in his life; the\\nDursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday,\\npreferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old\\nneighbor. However, he and Hermione worked out\\nwhere most of the poles and pegs should go, and\\nthough Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a\\nhelp, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it\\ncame to using the mallet, they finally managed to\\nerect a pair of shabby two-man tents.\\nAll of them stood back to admire their handiwork.\\nNobody looking at these tents would guess they\\nbelonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble\\nwas that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they\\nwould be a party of ten. Hermione seemed to have\\nspotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical\\nlook as Mr. Weasley dropped to his hands and knees\\nand entered the first tent.\\n“Well be a bit cramped,” he called, “but I think we’ll\\nall squeeze in. Come and have a look.”\\nHarry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt\\nhis jaw drop. He had walked into what looked like an\\nold-fashioned, three-room flat, complete with\\nbathroom and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was\\nfurnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs.\\nFigg’s house: There were crocheted covers on the\\nmismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Well, it’s not for long,” said Mr. Weasley, mopping his\\nbald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the\\nfour bunk beds that stood in the bedroom. “I\\nborrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn’t\\ncamp much anymore, poor fellow, he’s got lumbago.”\\nHe picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it.\\n“Well need water. ...”\\n“There’s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave\\nus,” said Ron, who had followed Harry inside the tent\\nand seemed completely unimpressed by its\\nextraordinary inner proportions. “It’s on the other\\nside of the field.”\\n“Well, why don’t you, Harry, and Hermione go and get\\nus some water then” — Mr. Weasley handed over the\\nkettle and a couple of saucepans — “and the rest of\\nus will get some wood for a fire?”\\n“But we’ve got an oven,” said Ron. “Why can’t we just\\n“Ron, anti-Muggle security!” said Mr. Weasley, his\\nface shining with anticipation. “When real Muggles\\ncamp, they cook on fires outdoors. I’ve seen them at\\nit!\\nAfter a quick tour of the girls’ tent, which was slightly\\nsmaller than the boys’, though without the smell of\\ncats, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off across the\\ncampsite with the kettle and saucepans.\\nNow, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting,\\nthey could see the city of tents that stretched in every\\ndirection. They made their way slowly through the\\nrows, staring eagerly around. It was only just\\ndawning on Harry how many witches and wizards\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nthere must be in the world; he had never really\\nthought much about those in other countries.\\nTheir fellow campers were starting to wake up. First\\nto stir were the families with small children; Harry\\nhad never seen witches and wizards this young\\nbefore. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched\\noutside a large pyramid-shaped tent, holding a wand\\nand poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was\\nswelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew\\nlevel with him, his mother came hurrying out of the\\ntent.\\n“ How ma.ny times, Kevin? You don’t — touch —\\nDaddy’s — wand — yecchh!”\\nShe had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her\\nscolding carried after them on the still air, mingling\\nwith the little boy’s yells — “You bust slug! You bust\\nslug!”\\nA short way farther on, they saw two little witches,\\nbarely older than Kevin, who were riding toy\\nbroomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls’\\ntoes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had\\nalready spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione he muttered distractedly, “In broad\\ndaylight! Parents having a lie-in, I suppose — ”\\nHere and there adult wizards and witches were\\nemerging from their tents and starting to cook\\nbreakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them,\\nconjured fires with their wands; others were striking\\nmatches with dubious looks on their faces, as though\\nsure this couldn’t work. Three African wizards sat in\\nserious conversation, all of them wearing long white\\nrobes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a\\nbright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged\\nAmerican witches sat gossiping happily beneath a\\n \\nspangled banner stretched between their tents that\\nread: THE SALEM WITCHES’ INSTITUTE. Harry\\ncaught snatches of conversation in strange languages\\nfrom the inside of tents they passed, and though he\\ncouldn’t understand a word, the tone of every single\\nvoice was excited.\\n“Er — is it my eyes, or has everything gone green?”\\nsaid Ron.\\nIt wasn’t just Ron’s eyes. They had walked into a\\npatch of tents that were all covered with a thick\\ngrowth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though\\nsmall, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the\\nearth. Grinning faces could be seen under those that\\nhad their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they\\nheard their names.\\n“Harry! Ron! Hermione!”\\nIt was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth\\nyear. He was sitting in front of his own shamrock-\\ncovered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who had to\\nbe his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas,\\nalso of Gryffindor.\\n“Like the decorations?” said Seamus, grinning. “The\\nMinistry’s not too happy.”\\n“Ah, why shouldn’t we show our colors?” said Mrs.\\nFinnigan. “You should see what the Bulgarians have\\ngot dangling all over their tents. You’ll be supporting\\nIreland, of course?” she added, eyeing Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione beadily. When they had assured her\\nthat they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off\\nagain, though, as Ron said, “Like we’d say anything\\nelse surrounded by that lot.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all\\nover their tents?” said Hermione.\\n“Let’s go and have a look,” said Harry, pointing to a\\nlarge patch of tents upheld, where the Bulgarian flag\\n— white, green, and red — was fluttering in the\\nbreeze.\\nThe tents here had not been bedecked with plant life,\\nbut each and every one of them had the same poster\\nattached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy\\nblack eyebrows. The picture was, of course, moving,\\nbut all it did was blink and scowl.\\n“Krum,” said Ron quietly.\\n“What?” said Hermione.\\n“Krum!” said Ron. “Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian\\nSeeker!”\\n“He looks really grumpy,” said Hermione, looking\\naround at the many Krums blinking and scowling at\\nthem.\\n“ ‘Really grumpy’?” Ron raised his eyes to the\\nheavens. “Who cares what he looks like? He’s\\nunbelievable. He’s really young too. Only just eighteen\\nor something. He’s a genius, you wait until tonight,\\nyou’ll see.”\\nThere was already a small queue for the tap in the\\ncorner of the field. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined\\nit, right behind a pair of men who were having a\\nheated argument. One of them was a very old wizard\\nwho was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other\\nwas clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a\\npair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with\\nexasperation.\\n \\n“Just put them on, Archie, there’s a good chap. You\\ncan’t walk around like that, the Muggle at the gate’s\\nalready getting suspicious — ”\\n“I bought this in a Muggle shop,” said the old wizard\\nstubbornly. “Muggles wear them.”\\n“Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they\\nwear these,” said the Ministry wizard, and he\\nbrandished the pinstriped trousers.\\n“I’m not putting them on,” said old Archie in\\nindignation. “I like a healthy breeze ’round my\\nprivates, thanks.”\\nHermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the\\ngiggles at this point that she had to duck out of the\\nqueue and only returned when Archie had collected\\nhis water and moved away.\\nWalking more slowly now, because of the weight of\\nthe water, they made their way back through the\\ncampsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar\\nfaces: other Hogwarts students with their families.\\nOliver Wood, the old captain of Harry’s House\\nQuidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged\\nHarry over to his parents’ tent to introduce him, and\\ntold him excitedly that he had just been signed to the\\nPuddlemere United reserve team. Next they were\\nhailed by Ernie Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year,\\nand a little farther on they saw Cho Chang, a very\\npretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team.\\nShe waved and smiled at Harry, who slopped quite a\\nlot of water down his front as he waved back. More to\\nstop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry\\nhurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers\\nwhom he had never seen before.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Who d’you reckon they are?” he said. “They don’t go\\nto Hogwarts, do they?”\\n“ ’Spect they go to some foreign school,” said Ron. “I\\nknow there are others. Never met anyone who went to\\none, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil\\n. . . this was years and years ago . . . and he wanted to\\ngo on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn’t\\nafford it. His penfriend got all offended when he said\\nhe wasn’t going and sent him a cursed hat. It made\\nhis ears shrivel up.”\\nHarry laughed but didn’t voice the amazement he felt\\nat hearing about other wizarding schools. He\\nsupposed, now that he saw representatives of so\\nmany nationalities in the campsite, that he had been\\nstupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn’t be the\\nonly one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly\\nunsurprised by the information. No doubt she had\\nrun across the news about other wizarding schools in\\nsome book or other.\\n“You’ve been ages,” said George when they finally got\\nback to the Weasleys’ tents.\\n“Met a few people,” said Ron, setting the water down.\\n“You not got that fire started yet?”\\n“Dad’s having fun with the matches,” said Fred.\\nMr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting\\nthe fire, but it wasn’t for lack of trying. Splintered\\nmatches littered the ground around him, but he\\nlooked as though he was having the time of his life.\\n“Oops!” he said as he managed to light a match and\\npromptly dropped it in surprise.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Come here, Mr. Weasley,” said Hermione kindly,\\ntaking the box from him, and showing him how to do\\nit properly.\\nAt last they got the fire lit, though it was at least\\nanother hour before it was hot enough to cook\\nanything. There was plenty to watch while they\\nwaited, however. Their tent seemed to be pitched right\\nalongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field, and\\nMinistry members kept hurrying up and down it,\\ngreeting Mr. Weasley cordially as they passed. Mr.\\nWeasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for\\nHarry’s and Hermione’s benefit; his own children\\nknew too much about the Ministry to be greatly\\ninterested.\\n“That was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin\\nLiaison Office. ... Here comes Gilbert Wimple; he’s\\nwith the Committee on Experimental Charms; he’s\\nhad those horns for awhile now. ... Hello, Arnie ...\\nArnold Peasegood, he’s an Obliviator — member of the\\nAccidental Magic Reversal Squad, you know. ... and\\nthat’s Bode and Croaker ... they’re Unspeakables. ...”\\n“They’re what?”\\n“From the Department of Mysteries, top secret, no\\nidea what they get up to. ...”\\nAt last, the fire was ready, and they had just started\\ncooking eggs and sausages when Bill, Charlie, and\\nPercy came strolling out of the woods toward them.\\n“Just Apparated, Dad,” said Percy loudly. “Ah,\\nexcellent, lunch!”\\nThey were halfway through their plates of eggs and\\nsausages when Mr. Weasley jumped to his feet,\\nwaving and grinning at a man who was striding\\n \\ntoward them. “Aha!” he said. “The man of the\\nmoment! Ludo!”\\nLudo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person\\nHarry had seen so far, even including old Archie in\\nhis flowered nightdress. He was wearing long\\nQuidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright\\nyellow and black. An enormous picture of a wasp was\\nsplashed across his chest. He had the look of a\\npowerfully built man gone slightly to seed; the robes\\nwere stretched tightly across a large belly he surely\\nhad not had in the days when he had played\\nQuidditch for England. His nose was squashed\\n(probably broken by a stray Bludger, Harry thought),\\nbut his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy\\ncomplexion made him look like a very overgrown\\nschoolboy.\\n“Ahoy there!” Bagman called happily. He was walking\\nas though he had springs attached to the balls of his\\nfeet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement.\\n“Arthur, old man,” he puffed as he reached the\\ncampfire, “what a day, eh? What a day! Could we\\nhave asked for more perfect weather? A cloudless\\nnight coming . . . and hardly a hiccough in the\\narrangements. ... Not much for me to do!”\\nBehind him, a group of haggard-looking Ministry\\nwizards rushed past, pointing at the distant evidence\\nof some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet\\nsparks twenty feet into the air.\\nPercy hurried forward with his hand outstretched.\\nApparently his disapproval of the way Ludo Bagman\\nran his department did not prevent him from wanting\\nto make a good impression.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Ah — yes,” said Mr. Weasley, grinning, “this is my\\nson Percy. He’s just started at the Ministry — and\\nthis is Fred — no, George, sorry — that’s Fred — Bill,\\nCharlie, Ron — my daughter, Ginny — and Ron’s\\nfriends, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter.”\\nBagman did the smallest of double takes when he\\nheard Harry’s name, and his eyes performed the\\nfamiliar flick upward to the scar on Harry’s forehead.\\n“Everyone,” Mr. Weasley continued, “this is Ludo\\nBagman, you know who he is, it’s thanks to him we’ve\\ngot such good tickets — ”\\nBagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it\\nhad been nothing.\\n“Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?” he said\\neagerly, jingling what seemed to be a large amount of\\ngold in the pockets of his yellow-and-black robes. “I’ve\\nalready got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will\\nscore first — I offered him nice odds, considering\\nIreland’s front three are the strongest I’ve seen in\\nyears — and little Agatha Timms has put up half\\nshares in her eel farm on a week-long match.”\\n“Oh ... go on then,” said Mr. Weasley. “Let’s see ... a\\nGalleon on Ireland to win?”\\n“A Galleon?” Ludo Bagman looked slightly\\ndisappointed, but recovered himself. “Very well, very\\nwell . . . any other takers?”\\n“They’re a bit young to be gambling,” said Mr.\\nWeasley. “Molly wouldn’t like — ”\\n“Well bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three\\nKnuts,” said Fred as he and George quickly pooled all\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ntheir money, “that Ireland wins — but Viktor Krum\\ngets the Snitch. Oh and we’ll throw in a fake wand.”\\n“You don’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish\\nlike that — ” Percy hissed, but Bagman didn’t seem to\\nthink the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary,\\nhis boyish face shone with excitement as he took it\\nfrom Fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk\\nand turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared\\nwith laughter.\\n“Excellent! I haven’t seen one that convincing in\\nyears! I’d pay five Galleons for that!”\\nPercy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval.\\n“Boys,” said Mr. Weasley under his breath, “I don’t\\nwant you betting. ... That’s all your savings. ... Your\\nmother — ”\\n“Don’t be a spoilsport, Arthur!” boomed Ludo\\nBagman, rattling his pockets excitedly. “They’re old\\nenough to know what they want! You reckon Ireland\\nwill win but Krum ’ll get the Snitch? Not a chance,\\nboys, not a chance. ... I’ll give you excellent odds on\\nthat one. ... We’ll add five Galleons for the funny\\nwand, then, shall we. ...”\\nMr. Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman\\nwhipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting\\ndown the twins’ names.\\n“Cheers,” said George, taking the slip of parchment\\nBagman handed him and tucking it away carefully.\\nBagman turned most cheerfully back to Mr. Weasley.\\n“Couldn’t do me a brew, I suppose? I’m keeping an\\neye out for Barty Crouch. My Bulgarian opposite\\nnumber’s making difficulties, and I can’t understand\\n \\na word he’s saying. Barty’ll be able to sort it out. He\\nspeaks about a hundred and fifty languages.”\\n“Mr. Crouch?” said Percy, suddenly abandoning his\\nlook of poker-stiff disapproval and positively writhing\\nwith excitement. “He speaks over two hundred!\\nMermish and Gobbledegook and Troll ...”\\n“Anyone can speak Troll,” said Fred dismissively. “All\\nyou have to do is point and grunt.”\\nPercy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked\\nthe fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil.\\n“Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?” Mr. Weasley\\nasked as Bagman settled himself down on the grass\\nbeside them all.\\n“Not a dicky bird,” said Bagman comfortably. “But\\nshe’ll turn up. Poor old Bertha ... memory like a leaky\\ncauldron and no sense of direction. Lost, you take my\\nword for it. She’ll wander back into the office\\nsometime in October, thinking it’s still July.”\\n“You don’t think it might be time to send someone to\\nlook for her?” Mr. Weasley suggested tentatively as\\nPercy handed Bagman his tea.\\n“Barty Crouch keeps saying that,” said Bagman, his\\nround eyes widening innocently, “but we really can’t\\nspare anyone at the moment. Oh — talk of the devil!\\nBarty!”\\nA wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he\\ncould not have made more of a contrast with Ludo\\nBagman, sprawled on the grass in his old Wasp\\nrobes. Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man,\\ndressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The\\nparting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally\\n \\nstraight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked\\nas though he trimmed it using a slide rule. His shoes\\nwere very highly polished. Harry could see at once\\nwhy Percy idolized him. Percy was a great believer in\\nrigidly following rules, and Mr. Crouch had complied\\nwith the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly\\nthat he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry\\ndoubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted him\\nfor what he really was.\\n“Pull up a bit of grass, Barty,” said Ludo brightly,\\npatting the ground beside him.\\n“No thank you, Ludo,” said Crouch, and there was a\\nbite of impatience in his voice. “I’ve been looking for\\nyou everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting we add\\nanother twelve seats to the Top Box.”\\n“Oh is that what they’re after?” said Bagman. “I\\nthought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of\\ntweezers. Bit of a strong accent.”\\n“Mr. Crouch!” said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a\\nkind of half-bow that made him look like a\\nhunchback. “Would you like a cup of tea?”\\n“Oh,” said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild\\nsurprise. “Yes — thank you, Weatherby.”\\nFred and George choked into their own cups. Percy,\\nvery pink around the ears, busied himself with the\\nkettle.\\n“Oh and I’ve been wanting a word with you too,\\nArthur,” said Mr. Crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon\\nMr. Weasley. “Ali Bashir’s on the warpath. He wants a\\nword with you about your embargo on flying carpets.”\\nMr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh.\\n \\n“I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I’ve\\ntold him once I’ve told him a hundred times: Carpets\\nare defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of\\nProscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?”\\n“I doubt it,” said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from\\nPercy. “He’s desperate to export here.”\\n“Well, they’ll never replace brooms in Britain, will\\nthey?” said Bagman.\\n“Ali thinks there’s a niche in the market for a family\\nvehicle,” said Mr. Crouch. “I remember my\\ngrandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve\\n— but that was before carpets were banned, of\\ncourse.”\\nHe spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any\\ndoubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the\\nlaw.\\n“So, been keeping busy, Barty?” said Bagman\\nbreezily.\\n“Fairly,” said Mr. Crouch dryly. “Organizing Portkeys\\nacross five continents is no mean feat, Ludo.”\\n“I expect you’ll both be glad when this is over?” said\\nMr. Weasley.\\nLudo Bagman looked shocked.\\n“Glad! Don’t know when I’ve had more fun. ... Still,\\nit’s not as though we haven’t got anything to look\\nforward to, eh, Barty? Eh? Plenty left to organize, eh?”\\nMr. Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“We agreed not to make the announcement until all\\nthe details — ”\\n“Oh details!” said Bagman, waving the word away like\\na cloud of midges. “They’ve signed, haven’t they?\\nThey’ve agreed, haven’t they? I bet you anything these\\nkids’ll know soon enough anyway. I mean, it’s\\nhappening at Hogwarts — ”\\n“Ludo, we need to meet the Bulgarians, you know,”\\nsaid Mr. Crouch sharply, cutting Bagman’s remarks\\nshort. “Thank you for the tea, Weatherby.”\\nHe pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited\\nfor Ludo to rise; Bagman struggled to his feet,\\nswigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his\\npockets chinking merrily.\\n“See you all later!” he said. “You’ll be up in the Top\\nBox with me — I’m commentating!” He waved, Barty\\nCrouch nodded curtly, and both of them\\nDisapparated.\\n“What’s happening at Hogwarts, Dad?” said Fred at\\nonce. “What were they talking about?”\\n“You’ll find out soon enough,” said Mr.Weasley,\\nsmiling.\\n“It’s classified information, until such time as the\\nMinistry decides to release it,” said Percy stiffly. “Mr.\\nCrouch was quite right not to disclose it.”\\n“Oh shut up, Weatherby,” said Fred.\\nA sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over\\nthe campsite as the afternoon wore on. By dusk, the\\nstill summer air itself seemed to be quivering with\\nanticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain\\n \\nover the thousands of waiting wizards, the last\\nvestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed\\nto have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting\\nthe signs of blatant magic now breaking out\\neverywhere.\\nSalesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying\\ntrays and pushing carts full of extraordinary\\nmerchandise. There were luminous rosettes — green\\nfor Ireland, red for Bulgaria — which were squealing\\nthe names of the players, pointed green hats\\nbedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves\\nadorned with lions that really roared, flags from both\\ncountries that played their national anthems as they\\nwere waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that\\nreally flew, and collectible figures of famous players,\\nwhich strolled across the palm of your hand, preening\\nthemselves.\\n“Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,”\\nRon told Harry as they and Hermione strolled through\\nthe salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron\\npurchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green\\nrosette, he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum,\\nthe Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum walked\\nbackward and forward over Ron’s hand, scowling up\\nat the green rosette above him.\\n“Wow, look at these!” said Harry, hurrying over to a\\ncart piled high with what looked like brass\\nbinoculars, except that they were covered with all\\nsorts of weird knobs and dials.\\n“Omnioculars,” said the saleswizard eagerly. “You can\\nreplay action . . . slow everything down . . . and they\\nflash up a play-by-play breakdown if you need it.\\nBargain — ten Galleons each.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Wish I hadn’t bought this now,” said Ron, gesturing\\nat his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at\\nthe Omnioculars.\\n“Three pairs,” said Harry firmly to the wizard.\\n“No — don’t bother,” said Ron, going red. He was\\nalways touchy about the fact that Harry, who had\\ninherited a small fortune from his parents, had much\\nmore money than he did.\\n“You won’t be getting anything for Christmas,” Harry\\ntold him, thrusting Omnioculars into his and\\nHermione’s hands. “For about ten years, mind.”\\n“Fair enough,” said Ron, grinning.\\n“Oooh, thanks, Harry,” said Hermione. “And I’ll get us\\nsome programs, look — ”\\nTheir money bags considerably lighter, they went\\nback to the tents. Bill, Charlie, and Ginny were all\\nsporting green rosettes too, and Mr. Weasley was\\ncarrying an Irish flag. Fred and George had no\\nsouvenirs as they had given Bagman all their gold.\\nAnd then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere\\nbeyond the woods, and at once, green and red\\nlanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to\\nthe field.\\n“It’s time!” said Mr. Weasley, looking as excited as any\\nof them. “Come on, let’s go!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n-4\\nTHE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP\\nClutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead,\\nthey all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-\\nlit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of\\npeople moving around them, shouts and laughter,\\nsnatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish\\nexcitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn’t stop\\ngrinning. They walked through the wood for twenty\\nminutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they\\nemerged on the other side and found themselves in\\nthe shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry\\ncould see only a fraction of the immense gold walls\\nsurrounding the field, he could tell that ten\\ncathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.\\n“Seats a hundred thousand,” said Mr. Weasley,\\nspotting the awestruck look on Harry’s face. “Ministry\\ntask force of five hundred have been working on it all\\nyear. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it.\\nEvery time Muggles have got anywhere near here all\\nyear, they’ve suddenly remembered urgent\\nappointments and had to dash away again . . . bless\\nthem,” he added fondly, leading the way toward the\\n \\nnearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a\\nswarm of shouting witches and wizards.\\n“Prime seats!” said the Ministry witch at the entrance\\nwhen she checked their tickets. “Top Box! Straight\\nupstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.”\\nThe stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich\\npurple. They clambered upward with the rest of the\\ncrowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into\\nthe stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley’s party\\nkept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the\\nstaircase and found themselves in a small box, set at\\nthe highest point of the stadium and situated exactly\\nhalfway between the golden goal posts. About twenty\\npurple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and\\nHarry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys,\\nlooked down upon a scene the likes of which he could\\nnever have imagined.\\nA hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking\\ntheir places in the seats, which rose in levels around\\nthe long oval field. Everything was suffused with a\\nmysterious golden light, which seemed to come from\\nthe stadium itself. The field looked smooth as velvet\\nfrom their lofty position. At either end of the field\\nstood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite\\nthem, almost at Harry’s eye level, was a gigantic\\nblackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as\\nthough an invisible giant’s hand were scrawling upon\\nthe blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching\\nit, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements\\nacross the field.\\nThe Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family — safe,\\nreliable, and with Built-in Anti-Burglar Buzzer ... Mrs.\\nSkower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No Pain,\\nNo Stain! ... Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris,\\nHogsmeade ...\\n \\nHarry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked\\nover his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box\\nwith them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny\\ncreature sitting in the second from last seat at the\\nend of the row behind them. The creature, whose legs\\nwere so short they stuck out in front of it on the\\nchair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and\\nit had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long,\\nbatlike ears were oddly familiar. . . .\\n“ Dobby ?” said Harry incredulously.\\nThe tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers,\\nrevealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact\\nsize and shape of a large tomato. It wasn’t Dobby — it\\nwas, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry’s\\nfriend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free\\nfrom his old owners, the Malfoy family.\\n“Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf\\ncuriously from between its fingers. Its voice was\\nhigher even than Dobby’s had been, a teeny,\\nquivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected —\\nthough it was very hard to tell with a house-elf — that\\nthis one might just be female. Ron and Hermione\\nspun around in their seats to look. Though they had\\nheard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never\\nactually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in\\ninterest.\\n“Sorry,” Harry told the elf, “I just thought you were\\nsomeone I knew.”\\n“But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf. She\\nwas shielding her face, as though blinded by light,\\nthough the Top Box was not brightly lit. “My name is\\nWinky, sir — and you, sir — ” Her dark brown eyes\\nwidened to the size of side plates as they rested upon\\nHarry’s scar. “You is surely Harry Potter!”\\n \\n“Yeah, I am,” said Harry.\\n“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said,\\nlowering her hands very slightly and looking\\nawestruck.\\n“How is he?” said Harry. “How’s freedom suiting\\nhim?”\\n“Ah, sir,” said Winky, shaking her head, “ah sir,\\nmeaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did\\nDobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.”\\n“Why?” said Harry, taken aback. “What’s wrong with\\nhim?”\\n“Freedom is going to Dobby’s head, sir,” said Winky\\nsadly. “Ideas above his station, sir. Can’t get another\\nposition, sir.”\\n“Why not?” said Harry.\\nWinky lowered her voice by a half-octave and\\nwhispered, “He is wanting paying for his work, sir.”\\n“Paying?” said Harry blankly. “Well — why shouldn’t\\nhe be paid?”\\nWinky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed\\nher fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden\\nagain.\\n“House-elves is not paid, sir!” she said in a muffled\\nsqueak. “No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find\\nyourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is\\ngetting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is\\nunbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing\\naround like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear\\nyou’s up in front of the Department for the Regulation\\n \\nand Control of Magical Creatures, like some common\\ngoblin.”\\n“Well, it’s about time he had a bit of fun,” said Harry.\\n“House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry\\nPotter,” said Winky firmly, from behind her hands.\\n“House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking\\nheights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the\\nedge of the box and gulped — “but my master sends\\nme to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”\\n“Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like\\nheights?” said Harry, frowning.\\n“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry\\nPotter. He is very busy,” said Winky, tilting her head\\ntoward the empty space beside her. “Winky is wishing\\nshe is back in master’s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky\\ndoes what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.”\\nShe gave the edge of the box another frightened look\\nand hid her eyes completely again. Harry turned back\\nto the others.\\n“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered. “Weird things,\\naren’t they?”\\n“Dobby was weirder,” said Harry fervently.\\nRon pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing\\nthem, staring down into the crowd on the other side\\nof the stadium.\\n“Wild!” he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side.\\n“I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose\\nagain ... and again ... and again ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through\\nher velvet-covered, tasseled program.\\n“ ‘A display from the team mascots will precede the\\nmatch,’ ” she read aloud.\\n“Oh that’s always worth watching,” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“National teams bring creatures from their native\\nland, you know, to put on a bit of a show.”\\nThe box filled gradually around them over the next\\nhalf hour. Mr. Weasley kept shaking hands with\\npeople who were obviously very important wizards.\\nPercy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as\\nthough he were trying to sit on a hedgehog. When\\nCornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself,\\narrived, Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off\\nand shattered. Highly embarrassed, he repaired them\\nwith his wand and thereafter remained in his seat,\\nthrowing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius\\nFudge had greeted like an old friend. They had met\\nbefore, and Fudge shook Harry’s hand in a fatherly\\nfashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to\\nthe wizards on either side of him.\\n“Harry Potter, you know,” he told the Bulgarian\\nminister loudly, who was wearing splendid robes of\\nblack velvet trimmed with gold and didn’t seem to\\nunderstand a word of English. “Harry Potter ... oh\\ncome on now, you know who he is . . . the boy who\\nsurvived You-Know-Who ... you do know who he is — ”\\nThe Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry’s scar\\nand started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at\\nit.\\n“Knew we’d get there in the end,” said Fudge wearily\\nto Harry. “I’m no great shakes at languages; I need\\nBarty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see his\\n \\nhouse-elf’s saving him a seat. ... Good job too, these\\nBulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the\\nbest places ... ah, and here’s Lucius!”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging\\nalong the second row to three still-empty seats right\\nbehind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the\\nhouse-elf’s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son,\\nDraco; and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco’s\\nmother.\\nHarry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since\\ntheir very first journey to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a\\npointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly\\nresembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall\\nand slim, she would have been nice-looking if she\\nhadn’t been wearing a look that suggested there was\\na nasty smell under her nose.\\n“Ah, Fudge,” said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as\\nhe reached the Minister of Magic. “How are you? I\\ndon’t think you’ve met my wife, Narcissa? Or our son,\\nDraco?”\\n“How do you do, how do you do?” said Fudge, smiling\\nand bowing to Mrs. Malfoy. “And allow me to\\nintroduce you to Mr. Oblansk — Obalonsk — Mr. —\\nwell, he’s the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he\\ncan’t understand a word I’m saying anyway, so never\\nmind. And let’s see who else — you know Arthur\\nWeasley, I daresay?”\\nIt was a tense moment. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy\\nlooked at each other and Harry vividly recalled the\\nlast time they had come face-to-face: It had been in\\nFlourish and Blotts’ bookshop, and they had had a\\nfight. Mr. Malfoy’s cold gray eyes swept over Mr.\\nWeasley, and then up and down the row.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Good lord, Arthur,” he said softly. “What did you\\nhave to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your\\nhouse wouldn’t have fetched this much?”\\nFudge, who wasn’t listening, said, “Lucius has just\\ngiven a very generous contribution to St. Mungo’s\\nHospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur.\\nHe’s here as my guest.”\\n“How — how nice,” said Mr. Weasley, with a very\\nstrained smile.\\nMr. Malfoy’s eyes had returned to Hermione, who\\nwent slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at\\nhim. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr.\\nMalfoy’s lip curl like that. The Malfoys prided\\nthemselves on being purebloods; in other words, they\\nconsidered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione,\\nsecond-class. However, under the gaze of the Minister\\nof Magic, Mr. Malfoy didn’t dare say anything. He\\nnodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley and continued\\ndown the line to his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione one contemptuous look, then settled\\nhimself between his mother and father.\\n“Slimy gits,” Ron muttered as he, Harry, and\\nHermione turned to face the field again. Next\\nmoment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box.\\n“Everyone ready?” he said, his round face gleaming\\nlike a great, excited Edam. “Minister — ready to go?”\\n“Ready when you are, Ludo,” said Fudge comfortably.\\nLudo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own\\nthroat, and said “Sonorusl” and then spoke over the\\nroar of sound that was now filling the packed\\nstadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into\\nevery corner of the stands.\\n \\n“Ladies and gentlemen ... welcome! Welcome to the\\nfinal of the four hundred and twenty-second\\nQuidditch World Cup!”\\nThe spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of\\nflags waved, adding their discordant national\\nanthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite\\nthem was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott’s\\nEvery Flavor Beans — A Risk With Every Mouthfull)\\nand now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.\\n“And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce\\n... the Bulgarian National Team Mascots!”\\nThe right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid\\nblock of scarlet, roared its approval.\\n“I wonder what they’ve brought,” said Mr. Weasley,\\nleaning forward in his seat. “Aaah!” He suddenly\\nwhipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly\\non his robes. “Veelal”\\n“What are veel — ?”\\nBut a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the\\nfield, and Harry’s question was answered for him.\\nVeela were women . . . the most beautiful women Harry\\nhad ever seen ... except that they weren’t — they\\ncouldn’t be — human. This puzzled Harry for a\\nmoment while he tried to guess what exactly they\\ncould be; what could make their skin shine moon-\\nbright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out\\nbehind them without wind . . . but then the music\\nstarted, and Harry stopped worrying about them not\\nbeing human — in fact, he stopped worrying about\\nanything at all.\\nThe veela had started to dance, and Harry’s mind had\\ngone completely and blissfully blank. All that\\n \\nmattered in the world was that he kept watching the\\nveela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things\\nwould happen. ...\\nAnd as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-\\nformed thoughts started chasing through Harry’s\\ndazed mind. He wanted to do something very\\nimpressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the\\nstadium seemed a good idea . . . but would it be good\\nenough?\\n“Harry, what are you doing?” said Hermione’s voice\\nfrom a long way off.\\nThe music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing\\nup, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the\\nbox. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that\\nlooked as though he were about to dive from a\\nspringboard.\\nAngry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn’t\\nwant the veela to go. Harry was with them; he would,\\nof course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered\\nvaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to\\nhis chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absent-mindedly\\nshredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley,\\nsmiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the\\nhat out of his hands.\\n“You’ll be wanting that,” he said, “once Ireland have\\nhad their say.”\\n“Huh?” said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela,\\nwho had now lined up along one side of the field.\\nHermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up\\nand pulled Harry back into his seat. “Honestlyl” she\\nsaid.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“And now,” roared Ludo Bagman’s voice, “kindly put\\nyour wands in the air ... for the Irish National Team\\nMascots!”\\nNext moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-\\ngold comet came zooming into the stadium. It did one\\ncircuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller\\ncomets, each hurtling toward the goal posts. A\\nrainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting\\nthe two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and\\naaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the\\nrainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and\\nmerged; they had formed a great shimmering\\nshamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to\\nsoar over the stands. Something like golden rain\\nseemed to be falling from it —\\n“Excellent!” yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over\\nthem, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing\\noff their heads and seats. Squinting up at the\\nshamrock, Harry realized that it was actually\\ncomprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men\\nwith red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or\\ngreen.\\n“Leprechauns!” said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous\\napplause of the crowd, many of whom were still\\nfighting and rummaging around under their chairs to\\nretrieve the gold.\\n“There you go,” Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of\\ngold coins into Harry’s hand, “for the Omnioculars!\\nNow you’ve got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!”\\nThe great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns\\ndrifted down onto the field on the opposite side from\\nthe veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to\\nwatch the match.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome —\\nthe Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you —\\nDimitrov!”\\nA scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast\\nit was blurred, shot out onto the field from an\\nentrance far below, to wild applause from the\\nBulgarian supporters.\\n“Ivanova!”\\nA second scarlet-robed player zoomed out.\\n“Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand —\\nKrum\\\\”\\n“That’s him, that’s him!” yelled Ron, following Krum\\nwith his Omnioculars. Harry quickly focused his own.\\nViktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with\\na large curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He\\nlooked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to\\nbelieve he was only eighteen.\\n“And now, please greet — the Irish National Quidditch\\nTeam!” yelled Bagman. “Presenting — Connolly! Ryan!\\nTroy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand — Lynch).”\\nSeven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a\\nsmall dial on the side of his Omnioculars and slowed\\nthe players down enough to read the word “Firebolt”\\non each of their brooms and see their names,\\nembroidered in silver, upon their backs.\\n“And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee,\\nacclaimed Chairwizard of the International\\nAssociation of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nA small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with\\na mustache to rival Uncle Vernon’s, wearing robes of\\npure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the\\nfield. A silver whistle was protruding from under the\\nmustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate\\nunder one arm, his broomstick under the other.\\nHarry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back\\nto normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his\\nbroomstick and kicked the crate open — four balls\\nburst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black\\nBludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment,\\nbefore it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged\\nGolden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle,\\nMostafa shot into the air after the balls.\\n“Theeeeeeeey’re OFF!” screamed Bagman. “And it’s\\nMullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy!\\nLevski! Moran!”\\nIt was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played\\nbefore. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to\\nhis glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of\\nhis nose. The speed of the players was incredible —\\nthe Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another\\nso fast that Bagman only had time to say their\\nnames. Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his\\nOmnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button\\non the top, and he was immediately watching in slow\\nmotion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across\\nthe lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded\\nagainst his eardrums.\\nHawkshead Attacking Formation, he read as he\\nwatched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely\\ntogether, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet\\nand Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians.\\nPorskoff Ploy flashed up next, as Troy made as though\\nto dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the\\nBulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to\\n \\nMoran. One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung\\nhard at a passing Bludger with his small club,\\nknocking it into Moran’s path; Moran ducked to avoid\\nthe Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski,\\nsoaring beneath, caught it —\\n“TROY SCORES!” roared Bagman, and the stadium\\nshuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. “Ten\\nzero to Ireland!”\\n“What?” Harry yelled, looking wildly around through\\nhis Omnioculars. “But Levski’s got the Quaffle!”\\n“Harry, if you’re not going to watch at normal speed,\\nyou’re going to miss things!” shouted Hermione, who\\nwas dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air\\nwhile Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry\\nlooked quickly over the top of his Omni-oculars and\\nsaw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines\\nhad all risen into the air again and formed the great,\\nglittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were\\nwatching them sulkily.\\nFurious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back\\nto normal as play resumed.\\nHarry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the\\nIrish Chasers were superb. They worked as a\\nseamless team, their movements so well coordinated\\nthat they appeared to be reading one another’s minds\\nas they positioned themselves, and the rosette on\\nHarry’s chest kept squeaking their names: “Troy —\\nMullet — Moran).” And within ten minutes, Ireland had\\nscored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero\\nand causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause\\nfrom the green-clad supporters.\\nThe match became still faster, but more brutal.\\nVolkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were\\n \\nwhacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the\\nIrish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from\\nusing some of their best moves; twice they were forced\\nto scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to\\nbreak through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan;\\nand score Bulgaria’s first goal.\\n“Fingers in your ears!” bellowed Mr. Weasley as the\\nveela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed\\nup his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the\\ngame. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the\\nfield. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria\\nwas again in possession of the Quaffle.\\n“Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova — oh I say!”\\nroared Bagman.\\nOne hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two\\nSeekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the\\ncenter of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though\\nthey had just jumped from airplanes without\\nparachutes. Harry followed their descent through his\\nOmnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was\\n“They’re going to crash!” screamed Hermione next to\\nHarry.\\nShe was half right — at the very last second, Viktor\\nKrum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch,\\nhowever, hit the ground with a dull thud that could\\nbe heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose\\nfrom the Irish seats.\\n“Fool!” moaned Mr. Weasley. “Krum was feinting!”\\n“It’s time-out!” yelled Bagman’s voice, “as trained\\nmediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan\\nLynch!”\\n \\n“He’ll be okay, he only got ploughed!” Charlie said\\nreassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side\\nof the box, looking horror-struck. “Which is what\\nKrum was after, of course. ...”\\nHarry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play\\nbuttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial,\\nand put them back up to his eyes.\\nHe watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow\\nmotion. Wronski Defensive Feint — dangerous Seeker\\ndiversion read the shining purple lettering across his\\nlenses. He saw Krum’s face contorted with\\nconcentration as he pulled out of the dive just in\\ntime, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood\\n— Krum hadn’t seen the Snitch at all, he was just\\nmaking Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen\\nanyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he\\nwas using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily\\nthrough the air that he looked unsupported and\\nweightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to\\nnormal and focused them on Krum. He was now\\ncircling high above Lynch, who was being revived by\\nmediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still\\nmore closely upon Krum’s face, saw his dark eyes\\ndarting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He\\nwas using the time while Lynch was revived to look\\nfor the Snitch without interference.\\nLynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the\\ngreen-clad supporters, mounted his Firebolt, and\\nkicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give\\nIreland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle\\nagain, the Chasers moved into action with a skill\\nunrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.\\nAfter fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland\\nhad pulled ahead by ten more goals. They were now\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nleading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and\\nthe game was starting to get dirtier.\\nAs Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again,\\nclutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the\\nBulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her.\\nWhatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn’t\\ncatch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd,\\nand Mostafa’s long, shrill whistle blast, told him it\\nhad been a foul.\\n“And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for\\ncobbing — excessive use of elbows!” Bagman informed\\nthe roaring spectators. “And — yes, it’s a penalty to\\nIreland!”\\nThe leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air\\nlike a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had\\nbeen fouled, now darted together to form the words\\n“HA, HA, HA!” The veela on the other side of the field\\nleapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and\\nstarted to dance again.\\nAs one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their\\nfingers into their ears, but Hermione, who hadn’t\\nbothered, was soon tugging on Harry’s arm. He\\nturned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers\\nimpatiently out of his ears.\\n“Look at the referee!” she said, giggling.\\nHarry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had\\nlanded right in front of the dancing veela, and was\\nacting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles\\nand smoothing his mustache excitedly.\\n“Now, we can’t have that!” said Ludo Bagman, though\\nhe sounded highly amused. “Somebody slap the\\nreferee!”\\n \\nA mediwizard came tearing across the field, his\\nfingers stuffed into his own ears, and kicked Mostafa\\nhard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself;\\nHarry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw\\nthat he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had\\nstarted shouting at the veela, who had stopped\\ndancing and were looking mutinous.\\n“And unless I’m much mistaken, Mostafa is actually\\nattempting to send off the Bulgarian team mascots!”\\nsaid Bagman’s voice. “Now there’s something we\\nhaven’t seen before. ... Oh this could turn nasty. ...”\\nIt did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov,\\nlanded on either side of Mostafa and began arguing\\nfuriously with him, gesticulating toward the\\nleprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words\\n“HEE, HEE, HEE.” Mostafa was not impressed by the\\nBulgarians’ arguments, however; he was jabbing his\\nfinger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying\\nagain, and when they refused, he gave two short\\nblasts on his whistle.\\n“Two penalties for Ireland!” shouted Bagman, and the\\nBulgarian crowd howled with anger. “And Volkov and\\nVulchanov had better get back on those brooms . . .\\nyes ... there they go ... and Troy takes the Quaffle ...”\\nPlay now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything\\nthey had yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were\\nacting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in\\nparticular seemed not to care whether their clubs\\nmade contact with Bludger or human as they swung\\nthem violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight\\nat Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her\\noff her broom.\\n“Foul\\\\” roared the Irish supporters as one, all\\nstanding up in a great wave of green.\\n \\n“Foul!” echoed Ludo Bagman’s magically magnified\\nvoice. “Dimitrov skins Moran — deliberately flying to\\ncollide there — and it’s got to be another penalty —\\nyes, there’s the whistle!”\\nThe leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this\\ntime, they formed a giant hand, which was making a\\nvery rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At\\nthis, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they\\nlaunched themselves across the field and began\\nthrowing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the\\nleprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars,\\nHarry saw that they didn’t look remotely beautiful\\nnow. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into\\nsharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings\\nwere bursting from their shoulders —\\n“And that, boys,” yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult\\nof the crowd below, “is why you should never go for\\nlooks alone!”\\nMinistry wizards were flooding onto the field to\\nseparate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little\\nsuccess; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was\\nnothing to the one taking place above. Harry turned\\nthis way and that, staring through his Omnioculars,\\nas the Quaffle changed hands with the speed of a\\nbullet.\\n“Levski — Dimitrov — Moran — Troy — Mullet —\\nIvanova — Moran again — Moran — MORAN\\nSCORES!”\\nBut the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely\\nheard over the shrieks of the veela, the blasts now\\nissuing from the Ministry members’ wands, and the\\nfurious roars of the Bulgarians. The game\\nrecommenced immediately; now Levski had the\\nQuaffle, now Dimitrov —\\n \\nThe Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing\\nBludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum,\\nwho did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in\\nthe face.\\nThere was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum’s\\nnose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but\\nHassan Mostafa didn’t blow his whistle. He had\\nbecome distracted, and Harry couldn’t blame him;\\none of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set\\nhis broom tail alight.\\nHarry wanted someone to realize that Krum was\\ninjured; even though he was supporting Ireland,\\nKrum was the most exciting player on the field. Ron\\nobviously felt the same.\\n“Time-out! Ah, come on, he can’t play like that, look\\nat him — ”\\n“Look at Lynch 1” Harry yelled.\\nFor the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive,\\nand Harry was quite sure that this was no Wronski\\nFeint; this was the real thing. ...\\n“He’s seen the Snitch!” Harry shouted. “He’s seen it!\\nLook at him go!”\\nHalf the crowd seemed to have realized what was\\nhappening; the Irish supporters rose in another great\\nwave of green, screaming their Seeker on . . . but Krum\\nwas on his tail. How he could see where he was going,\\nHarry had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying\\nthrough the air behind him, but he was drawing level\\nwith Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward\\nthe ground again —\\n“They’re going to crash!” shrieked Hermione.\\n \\n“They’re not!” roared Ron.\\n“Lynch is!” yelled Harry.\\nAnd he was right — for the second time, Lynch hit the\\nground with tremendous force and was immediately\\nstampeded by a horde of angry veela.\\n“The Snitch, where’s the Snitch?” bellowed Charlie,\\nalong the row.\\n“He’s got it — Krum’s got it — it’s all over!” shouted\\nHarry.\\nKrum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose,\\nwas rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint\\nof gold in his hand.\\nThe scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160,\\nIRELAND: 170 across the crowd, who didn’t seem to\\nhave realized what had happened. Then, slowly, as\\nthough a great jumbo jet were revving up, the\\nrumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and\\nlouder and erupted into screams of delight.\\n“IRELAND WINS!” Bagman shouted, who like the\\nIrish, seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of\\nthe match. “KRUM GETS THE SNITCH — BUT\\nIRELAND WINS — good lord, I don’t think any of us\\nwere expecting that!”\\n“What did he catch the Snitch for?” Ron bellowed,\\neven as he jumped up and down, applauding with his\\nhands over his head. “He ended it when Ireland were\\na hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!”\\n“He knew they were never going to catch up!” Harry\\nshouted back over all the noise, also applauding\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nloudly. “The Irish Chasers were too good. ... He\\nwanted to end it on his terms, that’s all. ...”\\n“He was very brave, wasn’t he?” Hermione said,\\nleaning forward to watch Krum land as a swarm of\\nmediwizards blasted a path through the battling\\nleprechauns and veela to get to him. “He looks a\\nterrible mess. ...”\\nHarry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was\\nhard to see what was happening below, because\\nleprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the\\nfield, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded\\nby mediwizards. He looked surlier than ever and\\nrefused to let them mop him up. His team members\\nwere around him, shaking their heads and looking\\ndejected; a short way away, the Irish players were\\ndancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from\\ntheir mascots. Flags were waving all over the stadium,\\nthe Irish national anthem blared from all sides; the\\nveela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful\\nselves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn.\\n“Veil, ve fought bravely,” said a gloomy voice behind\\nHarry. He looked around; it was the Bulgarian\\nMinister of Magic.\\n“You can speak English!” said Fudge, sounding\\noutraged. “And you’ve been letting me mime\\neverything all day!”\\n“Veil, it vos very funny,” said the Bulgarian minister,\\nshrugging.\\n“And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor,\\nflanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup\\nitself is brought into the Top Box!” roared Bagman.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry’s eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding\\nwhite light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated\\nso that everyone in the stands could see the inside.\\nSquinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting\\nwizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box,\\nwhich they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still\\nlooking very disgruntled that he’d been using sign\\nlanguage all day for nothing.\\n“Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers —\\nBulgaria!” Bagman shouted.\\nAnd up the stairs into the box came the seven\\ndefeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below was\\napplauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands\\nand thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and\\nwinking in their direction.\\nOne by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of\\nseats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of\\neach as they shook hands with their own minister\\nand then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line,\\nlooked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming\\nspectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding\\nthe Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less\\ncoordinated on the ground. He was slightly duck-\\nfooted and distinctly round-shouldered. But when\\nKrum’s name was announced, the whole stadium\\ngave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.\\nAnd then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being\\nsupported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash\\nseemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked\\nstrangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy\\nand Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd\\nbelow thundered its approval. Harry’s hands were\\nnumb with clapping.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nAt last, when the Irish team had left the box to\\nperform another lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan\\nLynch on the back of Connolly’s, clutching hard\\naround his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort\\nof way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and\\nmuttered, “Quietus.”\\n“They’ll be talking about this one for years,” he said\\nhoarsely, “a really unexpected twist, that. ... shame it\\ncouldn’t have lasted longer. ... Ah yes. ... yes, I owe\\nyou . . . how much?”\\nFor Fred and George had just scrambled over the\\nbacks of their seats and were standing in front of\\nLudo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their\\nhands outstretched.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n9\\nTHE DARK MARK\\n“ Don’t tell your mother you’ve been gambling,” Mr.\\nWeasley implored Fred and George as they all made\\ntheir way slowly down the purple-carpeted stairs.\\n“Don’t worry, Dad,” said Fred gleefully, “we’ve got big\\nplans for this money. We don’t want it confiscated.”\\nMr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was\\ngoing to ask what these big plans were, but seemed to\\ndecide, upon reflection, that he didn’t want to know.\\nThey were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding\\nout of the stadium and back to their campsites.\\nRaucous singing was borne toward them on the night\\nair as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit\\npath, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads,\\ncackling and waving their lanterns. When they finally\\nreached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and\\ngiven the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley\\nagreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa\\ntogether before turning in. They were soon arguing\\nenjoyably about the match; Mr. Weasley got drawn\\n \\ninto a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and\\nit was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny\\ntable and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that\\nMr. Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and\\ninsisted that everyone go to bed. Hermione and Ginny\\nwent into the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the\\nWeasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into\\ntheir bunks. From the other side of the campsite they\\ncould still hear much singing and the odd echoing\\nbang.\\n“Oh I am glad I’m not on duty,” muttered Mr. Weasley\\nsleepily. “I wouldn’t fancy having to go and tell the\\nIrish they’ve got to stop celebrating.”\\nHarry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring\\nup at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow\\nof an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead,\\nand picturing again some of Krum’s more spectacular\\nmoves. He was itching to get back on his own Firebolt\\nand try out the Wronski Feint. ... Somehow Oliver\\nWood had never managed to convey with all his\\nwriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to\\nlook like. ... Harry saw himself in robes that had his\\nname on the back, and imagined the sensation of\\nhearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as\\nLudo Bagman’s voice echoed throughout the stadium,\\n“I give you ... PotteA.”\\nHarry never knew whether or not he had actually\\ndropped off to sleep — his fantasies of flying like\\nKrum might well have slipped into actual dreams —\\nall he knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr. Weasley\\nwas shouting.\\n“Get up! Ron — Harry — come on now, get up, this is\\nurgent!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit\\ncanvas.\\n“ ’S’ matter?” he said.\\nDimly, he could tell that something was wrong. The\\nnoises in the campsite had changed. The singing had\\nstopped. He could hear screams, and the sound of\\npeople running. He slipped down from the bunk and\\nreached for his clothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had\\npulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, “No\\ntime, Harry — just grab a jacket and get outside —\\nquickly!”\\nHarry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent,\\nRon at his heels.\\nBy the light of the few fires that were still burning, he\\ncould see people running away into the woods, fleeing\\nsomething that was moving across the field toward\\nthem, something that was emitting odd flashes of\\nlight and noises like gunfire. Loud jeering, roars of\\nlaughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward\\nthem; then came a burst of strong green light, which\\nilluminated the scene.\\nA crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving\\ntogether with wands pointing straight upward, was\\nmarching slowly across the field. Harry squinted at\\nthem. ... They didn’t seem to have faces. ... Then he\\nrealized that their heads were hooded and their faces\\nmasked. High above them, floating along in midair,\\nfour struggling figures were being contorted into\\ngrotesque shapes. It was as though the masked\\nwizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the\\npeople above them were marionettes operated by\\ninvisible strings that rose from the wands into the air.\\nTwo of the figures were very small.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nMore wizards were joining the marching group,\\nlaughing and pointing up at the floating bodies. Tents\\ncrumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled.\\nOnce or twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a\\ntent out of his way with his wand. Several caught fire.\\nThe screaming grew louder.\\nThe floating people were suddenly illuminated as they\\npassed over a burning tent and Harry recognized one\\nof them: Mr. Roberts, the campsite manager. The\\nother three looked as though they might be his wife\\nand children. One of the marchers below flipped Mrs.\\nRoberts upside down with his wand; her nightdress\\nfell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she\\nstruggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her\\nscreeched and hooted with glee.\\n“That’s sick,” Ron muttered, watching the smallest\\nMuggle child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty\\nfeet above the ground, his head flopping limply from\\nside to side. “That is really sick. ...”\\nHermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them,\\npulling coats over their nightdresses, with Mr.\\nWeasley right behind them. At the same moment, Bill,\\nCharlie, and Percy emerged from the boys’ tent, fully\\ndressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands\\nout.\\n“We’re going to help the Ministry!” Mr. Weasley\\nshouted over all the noise, rolling up his own sleeves.\\n“You lot — get into the woods, and stick together. I’ll\\ncome and fetch you when we’ve sorted this out!”\\nBill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away\\ntoward the oncoming marchers; Mr. Weasley tore\\nafter them. Ministry wizards were dashing from every\\ndirection toward the source of the trouble. The crowd\\nbeneath the Roberts family was coming ever closer.\\n \\n“C’mon,” said Fred, grabbing Ginny’s hand and\\nstarting to pull her toward the wood. Harry, Ron,\\nHermione, and George followed. They all looked back\\nas they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the\\nRoberts family was larger than ever; they could see\\nthe Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the\\nhooded wizards in the center, but they were having\\ngreat difficulty. It looked as though they were scared\\nto perform any spell that might make the Roberts\\nfamily fall.\\nThe colored lanterns that had lit the path to the\\nstadium had been extinguished. Dark figures were\\nblundering through the trees; children were crying;\\nanxious shouts and panicked voices were\\nreverberating around them in the cold night air.\\nHarry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by\\npeople whose faces he could not see. Then he heard\\nRon yell with pain.\\n“What happened?” said Hermione anxiously, stopping\\nso abruptly that Harry walked into her. “Ron, where\\nare you? Oh this is stupid — lumos\\\\”\\nShe illuminated her wand and directed its narrow\\nbeam across the path. Ron was lying sprawled on the\\nground.\\n“Tripped over a tree root,” he said angrily, getting to\\nhis feet again.\\n“Well, with feet that size, hard not to,” said a drawling\\nvoice from behind them.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco\\nMalfoy was standing alone nearby, leaning against a\\ntree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he\\nseemed to have been watching the scene at the\\ncampsite through a gap in the trees.\\n \\nRon told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he\\nwould never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley\\n“Language, Weasley,” said Malfoy, his pale eyes\\nglittering. “Hadn’t you better be hurrying along, now?\\nYou wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?”\\nHe nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a\\nblast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a\\nflash of green light momentarily lit the trees around\\nthem.\\n“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Hermione\\ndefiantly.\\n“Granger, they’re after Muggles,” said Malfoy. “D’you\\nwant to be showing off your knickers in midair?\\nBecause if you do, hang around ... they’re moving this\\nway, and it would give us all a laugh.”\\n“Hermione’s a witch,” Harry snarled.\\n“Have it your own way, Potter,” said Malfoy, grinning\\nmaliciously. “If you think they can’t spot a Mudblood,\\nstay where you are.”\\n“You watch your mouth!” shouted Ron. Everybody\\npresent knew that “Mudblood” was a very offensive\\nterm for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage.\\n“Never mind, Ron,” said Hermione quickly, seizing\\nRon’s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward\\nMalfoy.\\nThere came a bang from the other side of the trees\\nthat was louder than anything they had heard.\\nSeveral people nearby screamed. Malfoy chuckled\\nsoftly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Scare easily, don’t they?” he said lazily. “I suppose\\nyour daddy told you all to hide? What’s he up to —\\ntrying to rescue the Muggles?”\\n“Where’re your parents?” said Harry, his temper\\nrising. “Out there wearing masks, are they?”\\nMalfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.\\n“Well ... if they were, I wouldn’t be likely to tell you,\\nwould I, Potter?”\\n“Oh come on,” said Hermione, with a disgusted look\\nat Malfoy, “let’s go and find the others.”\\n“Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,” sneered\\nMalfoy.\\n“Come on,” Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry\\nand Ron up the path again.\\n“I’ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked\\nlot!” said Ron hotly.\\n“Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!”\\nsaid Hermione fervently. “Oh I can’t believe this.\\nWhere have the others got to?”\\nFred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen,\\nthough the path was packed with plenty of other\\npeople, all looking nervously over their shoulders\\ntoward the commotion back at the campsite. A huddle\\nof teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a\\nlittle way along the path. When they saw Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and\\nsaid quickly, “ Ou est Madame Maxime? Nous Vavons\\nperdue — ”\\n“Er — what?” said Ron.\\n \\n“Oh ...” The girl who had spoken turned her back on\\nhim, and as they walked on they distinctly heard her\\nsay, “ ’Ogwarts.”\\n“Beauxbatons,” muttered Hermione.\\n“Sorry?” said Harry.\\n“They must go to Beauxbatons,” said Hermione. “You\\nknow . . . Beauxbatons Academy of Magic ... I read\\nabout it in An Appraisal of Magical Education in\\nEurope.”\\n“Oh ... yeah ... right,” said Harry.\\n“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said Ron,\\npulling out his wand, lighting it like Hermione’s, and\\nsquinting up the path. Harry dug in the pockets of his\\njacket for his own wand — but it wasn’t there. The\\nonly thing he could find was his Omnioculars.\\n“Ah, no, I don’t believe it ... I’ve lost my wand!”\\n“You’re kidding!”\\nRon and Hermione raised their wands high enough to\\nspread the narrow beams of light farther on the\\nground; Harry looked all around him, but his wand\\nwas nowhere to be seen.\\n“Maybe it’s back in the tent,” said Ron.\\n“Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were\\nrunning?” Hermione suggested anxiously.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “maybe ...”\\nHe usually kept his wand with him at all times in the\\nwizarding world, and finding himself without it in the\\n \\nmidst of a scene like this made him feel very\\nvulnerable.\\nA rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump.\\nWinky the house-elf was fighting her way out of a\\nclump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a most\\npeculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it\\nwas as though someone invisible were trying to hold\\nher back.\\n“There is bad wizards about!” she squeaked\\ndistractedly as she leaned forward and labored to\\nkeep running. “People high — high in the air! Winky\\nis getting out of the way!”\\nAnd she disappeared into the trees on the other side\\nof the path, panting and squeaking as she fought the\\nforce that was restraining her.\\n“What’s up with her?” said Ron, looking curiously\\nafter Winky. “Why can’t she run properly?”\\n“Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide,” said Harry.\\nHe was thinking of Dobby: Every time he had tried to\\ndo something the Malfoys wouldn’t like, the house-elf\\nhad been forced to start beating himself up.\\n“You know, house-elves get a very raw deal!” said\\nHermione indignantly. “It’s slavery, that’s what it is!\\nThat Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the\\nstadium, and she was terrified, and he’s got her\\nbewitched so she can’t even run when they start\\ntrampling tents! Why doesn’t anyone do something\\nabout it?”\\n“Well, the elves are happy, aren’t they?” Ron said.\\n“You heard old Winky back at the match ... ‘House-\\nelves is not supposed to have fun’ ... that’s what she\\nlikes, being bossed around. ...”\\n \\n“It’s people like you, Ron,” Hermione began hotly,\\n“who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just\\nbecause they’re too lazy to — ”\\nAnother loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.\\n“Let’s just keep moving, shall we?” said Ron, and\\nHarry saw him glance edgily at Hermione. Perhaps\\nthere was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps\\nHermione was in more danger than they were. They\\nset off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even\\nthough he knew his wand wasn’t there.\\nThey followed the dark path deeper into the wood,\\nstill keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny.\\nThey passed a group of goblins who were cackling\\nover a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won\\nbetting on the match, and who seemed quite\\nunperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther\\nstill along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery\\nlight, and when they looked through the trees, they\\nsaw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a\\nclearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all\\nof whom were talking very loudly.\\n“I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a\\nyear!” one of them shouted. “I’m a dragon killer for\\nthe Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous\\nCreatures.”\\n“No, you’re not!” yelled his friend. “You’re a\\ndishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron. ... but I’m a\\nvampire hunter, I’ve killed about ninety so far — ”\\nA third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even\\nby the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, “I’m\\nabout to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic,\\nI am.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry snorted with laughter. He recognized the\\npimply wizard: His name was Stan Shunpike, and he\\nwas in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight\\nBus. He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron’s face had\\ngone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling,\\n“Did I tell you I’ve invented a broomstick that’ll reach\\nJupiter?”\\n“Honestly\\\\” said Hermione, and she and Harry\\ngrabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around,\\nand marched him away. By the time the sounds of\\nthe veela and their admirers had faded completely,\\nthey were in the very heart of the wood. They seemed\\nto be alone now; everything was much quieter.\\nHarry looked around. “I reckon we can just wait here,\\nyou know. Well hear anyone coming a mile off.”\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo\\nBagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of\\nthem.\\nEven by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could\\nsee that a great change had come over Bagman. He\\nno longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was\\nno more spring in his step. He looked very white and\\nstrained.\\n“Who’s that?” he said, blinking down at them, trying\\nto make out their faces. “What are you doing in here,\\nall alone?”\\nThey looked at one another, surprised.\\n“Well — there’s a sort of riot going on,” said Ron.\\nBagman stared at him.\\n“What?”\\n \\n“At the campsite . . . some people have got hold of a\\nfamily of Muggles. ...”\\nBagman swore loudly.\\n“Damn them!” he said, looking quite distracted, and\\nwithout another word, he Disapparated with a small\\npop\\\\\\n“Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?”\\nsaid Hermione, frowning.\\n“He was a great Beater, though,” said Ron, leading\\nthe way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting\\ndown on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree.\\n“The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in\\na row while he was with them.”\\nHe took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set\\nit down on the ground, and watched it walk around.\\nLike the real Krum, the model was slightly duck-\\nfooted and round-shouldered, much less impressive\\non his splayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was\\nlistening for noise from the campsite. Everything\\nseemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.\\n“I hope the others are okay,” said Hermione after a\\nwhile.\\n“They’ll be fine,” said Ron.\\n“Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,” said\\nHarry, sitting down next to Ron and watching the\\nsmall figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves.\\n“He’s always said he’d like to get something on him.”\\n“That’d wipe the smirk off old Draco’s face, all right,”\\nsaid Ron.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Those poor Muggles, though,” said Hermione\\nnervously. “What if they can’t get them down?”\\n“They will,” said Ron reassuringly. “They’ll find a\\nway.”\\n“Mad, though, to do something like that when the\\nwhole Ministry of Magic’s out here tonight!” said\\nHermione. “I mean, how do they expect to get away\\nwith it? Do you think they’ve been drinking, or are\\nthey just — ”\\nBut she broke off abruptly and looked over her\\nshoulder. Harry and Ron looked quickly around too.\\nIt sounded as though someone was staggering toward\\ntheir clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of\\nthe uneven steps behind the dark trees. But the\\nfootsteps came to a sudden halt.\\n“Hello?” called Harry.\\nThere was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered\\naround the tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he\\ncould sense somebody standing just beyond the range\\nof his vision.\\n“Who’s there?” he said.\\nAnd then, without warning, the silence was rent by a\\nvoice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it\\nuttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like\\na spell.\\n“MORSMORDREl ”\\nAnd something vast, green, and glittering erupted\\nfrom the patch of darkness Harry’s eyes had been\\nstruggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops\\nand into the sky.\\n \\n“What the — ?” gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet\\nagain, staring up at the thing that had appeared.\\nFor a split second, Harry thought it was another\\nleprechaun formation. Then he realized that it was a\\ncolossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald\\nstars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a\\ntongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher,\\nblazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against\\nthe black sky like a new constellation.\\nSuddenly, the wood all around them erupted with\\nscreams. Harry didn’t understand why, but the only\\npossible cause was the sudden appearance of the\\nskull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate\\nthe entire wood like some grisly neon sign. He\\nscanned the darkness for the person who had\\nconjured the skull, but he couldn’t see anyone.\\n“Who’s there?” he called again.\\n“Harry, come on, move\\\\” Hermione had seized the\\ncollar of his jacket and was tugging him backward.\\n“What’s the matter?” Harry said, startled to see her\\nface so white and terrified.\\n“It’s the Dark Mark, Harry!” Hermione moaned,\\npulling him as hard as she could. “You-Know-Who’s\\nsign!”\\n“Voldemort’s — ?”\\n“Harry, come on!”\\nHarry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his\\nminiature Krum — the three of them started across\\nthe clearing — but before they had taken a few\\nhurried steps, a series of popping noises announced\\n \\nthe arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air,\\nsurrounding them.\\nHarry whirled around, and in an instant, he\\nregistered one fact: Each of these wizards had his\\nwand out, and every wand was pointing right at\\nhimself, Ron, and Hermione.\\nWithout pausing to think, he yelled, “DUCK!”\\nHe seized the other two and pulled them down onto\\nthe ground.\\n“STUPEFYl” roared twenty voices — there was a\\nblinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on\\nhis head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept\\nthe clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he\\nsaw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the\\nwizards’ wands, crossing one another, bouncing off\\ntree trunks, rebounding into the darkness —\\n“Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized. “STOP! That’s my\\nson\\\\”\\nHarry’s hair stopped blowing about. He raised his\\nhead a little higher. The wizard in front of him had\\nlowered his wand. He rolled over and saw Mr. Weasley\\nstriding toward them, looking terrified.\\n“Ron — Harry” — his voice sounded shaky —\\n“Hermione — are you all right?”\\n“Out of the way, Arthur,” said a cold, curt voice.\\nIt was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards\\nwere closing in on them. Harry got to his feet to face\\nthem. Mr. Crouch’s face was taut with rage.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Which of you did it?” he snapped, his sharp eyes\\ndarting between them. “Which of you conjured the\\nDark Mark?”\\n“We didn’t do that!” said Harry, gesturing up at the\\nskull.\\n“We didn’t do anything!” said Ron, who was rubbing\\nhis elbow and looking indignantly at his father. “What\\ndid you want to attack us for?”\\n“Do not lie, sir!” shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was\\nstill pointing directly at Ron, and his eyes were\\npopping — he looked slightly mad. “You have been\\ndiscovered at the scene of the crime!”\\n“Barty,” whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing\\ngown, “they’re kids, Barty, they’d never have been\\nable to — ”\\n“Where did the Mark come from, you three?” said Mr.\\nWeasley quickly.\\n“Over there,” said Hermione shakily, pointing at the\\nplace where they had heard the voice. “There was\\nsomeone behind the trees . . . they shouted words —\\nan incantation — ”\\n“Oh, stood over there, did they?” said Mr. Crouch,\\nturning his popping eyes on Hermione now, disbelief\\netched all over his face. “Said an incantation, did\\nthey? You seem very well informed about how that\\nMark is summoned, missy — ”\\nBut none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr.\\nCrouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry,\\nRon, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the\\ncontrary, at Hermione’s words, they had all raised\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ntheir wands again and were pointing in the direction\\nshe had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.\\n“We’re too late,” said the witch in the woolen dressing\\ngown, shaking her head. “They’ll have Disapparated.”\\n“I don’t think so,” said a wizard with a scrubby brown\\nbeard. It was Amos Diggory, Cedric’s father. “Our\\nStunners went right through those trees. ... There’s a\\ngood chance we got them. ...”\\n“Amos, be careful!” said a few of the wizards\\nwarningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders,\\nraised his wand, marched across the clearing, and\\ndisappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched\\nhim vanish with her hands over her mouth.\\nA few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout.\\n“Yes! We got them! There’s someone here!\\nUnconscious! It’s — but — blimey ...”\\n“You’ve got someone?” shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding\\nhighly disbelieving. “Who? Who is it?”\\nThey heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and\\nthen crunching footsteps as Mr. Diggory reemerged\\nfrom behind the trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp\\nfigure in his arms. Harry recognized the tea towel at\\nonce. It was Winky.\\nMr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory\\ndeposited his elf on the ground at his feet. The other\\nMinistry wizards were all staring at Mr. Crouch. For a\\nfew seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes\\nblazing in his white face as he stared down at Winky.\\nThen he appeared to come to life again.\\n“This — cannot — be,” he said jerkily. “No — ”\\n \\nHe moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off\\ntoward the place where he had found Winky.\\n“No point, Mr. Crouch,” Mr. Diggory called after him.\\n“There’s no one else there.”\\nBut Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his\\nword for it. They could hear him moving around and\\nthe rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside,\\nsearching.\\n“Bit embarrassing,” Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking\\ndown at Winky’s unconscious form. “Barty Crouch’s\\nhouse-elf ... I mean to say ...”\\n“Come off it, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “you\\ndon’t seriously think it was the elf? The Dark Mark’s a\\nwizard’s sign. It requires a wand.”\\n“Yeah,” said Mr. Diggory, “and she had a wand.”\\n“What?” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“Here, look.” Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed\\nit to Mr. Weasley. “Had it in her hand. So that’s\\nclause three of the Code of Wand Use broken, for a\\nstart. No non-human creature is permitted to carry or\\nuse a wand.”\\nJust then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman\\nApparated right next to Mr. Weasley. Looking\\nbreathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot,\\ngoggling upward at the emerald-green skull.\\n“The Dark Mark!” he panted, almost trampling Winky\\nas he turned inquiringly to his colleagues. “Who did\\nit? Did you get them? Barty! What’s going on?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nMr. Crouch had returned empty-handed. His face was\\nstill ghostly white, and his hands and his toothbrush\\nmustache were both twitching.\\n“Where have you been, Barty?” said Bagman. “Why\\nweren’t you at the match? Your elf was saving you a\\nseat too — gulping gargoyles!” Bagman had just\\nnoticed Winky lying at his feet. “What happened to\\nher?”\\n“I have been busy, Ludo,” said Mr. Crouch, still\\ntalking in the same jerky fashion, barely moving his\\nlips. “And my elf has been stunned.”\\n“Stunned? By you lot, you mean? But why — ?”\\nComprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman’s\\nround, shiny face; he looked up at the skull, down at\\nWinky, and then at Mr. Crouch.\\n“iVo!” he said. “Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She\\nwouldn’t know how! She’d need a wand, for a start!”\\n“And she had one,” said Mr. Diggory. “I found her\\nholding one, Ludo. If it’s all right with you, Mr.\\nCrouch, I think we should hear what she’s got to say\\nfor herself.”\\nCrouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory,\\nbut Mr. Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent.\\nHe raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and\\nsaid, “Rennervatel”\\nWinky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened\\nand she blinked several times in a bemused sort of\\nway. Watched by the silent wizards, she raised herself\\nshakily into a sitting position. She caught sight of Mr.\\nDiggory’s feet, and slowly, tremulously, raised her\\neyes to stare up into his face; then, more slowly still,\\n \\nshe looked up into the sky. Harry could see the\\nfloating skull reflected twice in her enormous, glassy\\neyes. She gave a gasp, looked wildly around the\\ncrowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs.\\n“Elf!” said Mr. Diggory sternly. “Do you know who I\\nam? I’m a member of the Department for the\\nRegulation and Control of Magical Creatures!”\\nWinky began to rock backward and forward on the\\nground, her breath coming in sharp bursts. Harry\\nwas reminded forcibly of Dobby in his moments of\\nterrified disobedience.\\n“As you see, elf, the Dark Mark was conjured here a\\nshort while ago,” said Mr. Diggory. “And you were\\ndiscovered moments later, right beneath it! An\\nexplanation, if you please!”\\n“I — I — I is not doing it, sir!” Winky gasped. “I is not\\nknowing how, sir!”\\n“You were found with a wand in your hand!” barked\\nMr. Diggory, brandishing it in front of her. And as the\\nwand caught the green light that was filling the\\nclearing from the skull above, Harry recognized it.\\n“Hey — that’s mine!” he said.\\nEveryone in the clearing looked at him.\\n“Excuse me?” said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.\\n“That’s my wand!” said Harry. “I dropped it!”\\n“You dropped it?” repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief.\\n“Is this a confession? You threw it aside after you\\nconjured the Mark?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Amos, think who you’re talking to!” said Mr. Weasley,\\nvery angrily. “Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the\\nDark Mark?”\\n“Er — of course not,” mumbled Mr. Diggory. “Sorry ...\\ncarried away ...”\\n“I didn’t drop it there, anyway,” said Harry, jerking\\nhis thumb toward the trees beneath the skull. “I\\nmissed it right after we got into the wood.”\\n“So,” said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he\\nturned to look at Winky again, cowering at his feet.\\n“You found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it up\\nand thought you’d have some fun with it, did you?”\\n“I is not doing magic with it, sir!” squealed Winky,\\ntears streaming down the sides of her squashed and\\nbulbous nose. “I is ... I is ... I is just picking it up, sir!\\nI is not making the Dark Mark, sir, I is not knowing\\nhow!”\\n“It wasn’t her!” said Hermione. She looked very\\nnervous, speaking up in front of all these Ministry\\nwizards, yet determined all the same. “Winky’s got a\\nsqueaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the\\nincantation was much deeper!” She looked around at\\nHarry and Ron, appealing for their support. “It didn’t\\nsound anything like Winky, did it?”\\n“No,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It definitely didn’t\\nsound like an elf.”\\n“Yeah, it was a human voice,” said Ron.\\n“Well, we’ll soon see,” growled Mr. Diggory, looking\\nunimpressed. “There’s a simple way of discovering the\\nlast spell a wand performed, elf, did you know that?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nWinky trembled and shook her head frantically, her\\nears flapping, as Mr. Diggory raised his own wand\\nagain and placed it tip to tip with Harry’s.\\n“ Prior Incantatol” roared Mr. Diggory.\\nHarry heard Hermione gasp, horrified, as a gigantic\\nserpent-tongued skull erupted from the point where\\nthe two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of the\\ngreen skull high above them; it looked as though it\\nwere made of thick gray smoke: the ghost of a spell.\\n“Deletrius\\\\” Mr. Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull\\nvanished in a wisp of smoke.\\n“So,” said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph,\\nlooking down upon Winky, who was still shaking\\nconvulsively.\\n“I is not doing it!” she squealed, her eyes rolling in\\nterror. “I is not, I is not, I is not knowing how! I is a\\ngood elf, I isn’t using wands, I isn’t knowing how!”\\n“ You’ve been caught red-handed, elf.” Mr. Diggory\\nroared. “Caught with the guilty wand in your hand\\\\”\\n“Amos,” said Mr. Weasley loudly, “think about it ...\\nprecious few wizards know how to do that spell. ...\\nWhere would she have learned it?”\\n“Perhaps Amos is suggesting,” said Mr. Crouch, cold\\nanger in every syllable, “that I routinely teach my\\nservants to conjure the Dark Mark?”\\nThere was a deeply unpleasant silence. Amos Diggory\\nlooked horrified. “Mr. Crouch ... not ... not at all ...”\\n“You have now come very close to accusing the two\\npeople in this clearing who are least likely to conjure\\n \\nthat Mark!” barked Mr. Crouch. “Harry Potter — and\\nmyself! I suppose you are familiar with the boy’s\\nstory, Amos?”\\n“Of course — everyone knows — ” muttered Mr.\\nDiggory, looking highly discomforted.\\n“And I trust you remember the many proofs I have\\ngiven, over a long career, that I despise and detest the\\nDark Arts and those who practice them?” Mr. Crouch\\nshouted, his eyes bulging again.\\n“Mr. Crouch, I — I never suggested you had anything\\nto do with it!” Amos Diggory muttered again, now\\nreddening behind his scrubby brown beard.\\n“If you accuse my elf, you accuse me, Diggory!”\\nshouted Mr. Crouch. “Where else would she have\\nlearned to conjure it?”\\n“She — she might’ve picked it up anywhere — ”\\n“Precisely, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley. “ She might have\\npicked it up anywhere. ... Winky?” he said kindly,\\nturning to the elf, but she flinched as though he too\\nwas shouting at her. “Where exactly did you find\\nHarry’s wand?”\\nWinky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so\\nviolently that it was fraying beneath her fingers.\\n“I — I is finding it ... finding it there, sir. ...” she\\nwhispered, “there ... in the trees, sir. ...”\\n“You see, Amos?” said Mr. Weasley. “Whoever\\nconjured the Mark could have Disapparated right\\nafter they’d done it, leaving Harry’s wand behind. A\\nclever thing to do, not using their own wand, which\\ncould have betrayed them. And Winky here had the\\n \\nmisfortune to come across the wand moments later\\nand pick it up.”\\n“But then, she’d have been only a few feet away from\\nthe real culprit!” said Mr. Diggory impatiently. “Elf?\\nDid you see anyone?”\\nWinky began to tremble worse than ever. Her giant\\neyes flickered from Mr. Diggory, to Ludo Bagman, and\\nonto Mr. Crouch. Then she gulped and said, “I is\\nseeing no one, sir ... no one ...”\\n“Amos,” said Mr. Crouch curtly, “I am fully aware\\nthat, in the ordinary course of events, you would want\\nto take Winky into your department for questioning. I\\nask you, however, to allow me to deal with her.”\\nMr. Diggory looked as though he didn’t think much of\\nthis suggestion at all, but it was clear to Harry that\\nMr. Crouch was such an important member of the\\nMinistry that he did not dare refuse him.\\n“You may rest assured that she will be punished,” Mr.\\nCrouch added coldly.\\n“M-m-master ...” Winky stammered, looking up at Mr.\\nCrouch, her eyes brimming with tears. “M-m-master,\\np-p-please ...”\\nMr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow\\nsharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched.\\nThere was no pity in his gaze.\\n“Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not\\nhave believed possible,” he said slowly. “I told her to\\nremain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I\\nwent to sort out the trouble. And I find that she\\ndisobeyed me. This means clothes.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr.\\nCrouch’s feet. “No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!”\\nHarry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free\\nwas to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful\\nto see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she\\nsobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet.\\n“But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily,\\nglaring at Mr. Crouch. “Your elf’s scared of heights,\\nand those wizards in masks were levitating people!\\nYou can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their\\nway!”\\nMr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself\\nfrom contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as\\nthough she were something filthy and rotten that was\\ncontaminating his over-shined shoes.\\n“I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,” he\\nsaid coldly, looking over at Hermione. “I have no use\\nfor a servant who forgets what is due to her master,\\nand to her master’s reputation.”\\nWinky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed\\naround the clearing. There was a very nasty silence,\\nwhich was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly,\\n“Well, I think I’ll take my lot back to the tent, if\\nnobody’s got any objections. Amos, that wand’s told\\nus all it can — if Harry could have it back, please — ”\\nMr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry\\npocketed it.\\n“Come on, you three,” Mr. Weasley said quietly. But\\nHermione didn’t seem to want to move; her eyes were\\nstill upon the sobbing elf. “Hermione!” Mr. Weasley\\nsaid, more urgently. She turned and followed Harry\\nand Ron out of the clearing and off through the trees.\\n \\n“What’s going to happen to Winky?” said Hermione,\\nthe moment they had left the clearing.\\n“I don’t know,” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“The way they were treating her!” said Hermione\\nfuriously. “Mr. Diggory, calling her ‘elf’ all the time ...\\nand Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn’t do it and he’s\\nstill going to sack her! He didn’t care how frightened\\nshe’d been, or how upset she was — it was like she\\nwasn’t even human!”\\n“Well, she’s not,” said Ron.\\nHermione rounded on him.\\n“That doesn’t mean she hasn’t got feelings, Ron. It’s\\ndisgusting the way — ”\\n“Hermione, I agree with you,” said Mr. Weasley\\nquickly, beckoning her on, “but now is not the time to\\ndiscuss elf rights. I want to get back to the tent as\\nfast as we can. What happened to the others?”\\n“We lost them in the dark,” said Ron. “Dad, why was\\neveryone so uptight about that skull thing?”\\n“I’ll explain everything back at the tent,” said Mr.\\nWeasley tensely.\\nBut when they reached the edge of the wood, their\\nprogress was impeded. A large crowd of frightened-\\nlooking witches and wizards was congregated there,\\nand when they saw Mr. Weasley coming toward them,\\nmany of them surged forward.\\n“What’s going on in there?”\\n“Who conjured it?”\\n \\n“Arthur — it’s not — Him?”\\n“Of course it’s not Him,” said Mr. Weasley\\nimpatiently. “We don’t know who it was; it looks like\\nthey Disapparated. Now excuse me, please, I want to\\nget to bed.”\\nHe led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd\\nand back into the campsite. All was quiet now; there\\nwas no sign of the masked wizards, though several\\nruined tents were still smoking.\\nCharlie’s head was poking out of the boys’ tent.\\n“Dad, what’s going on?” he called through the dark.\\n“Fred, George, and Ginny got back okay, but the\\nothers — ”\\n“I’ve got them here,” said Mr. Weasley, bending down\\nand entering the tent. Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\nentered after him.\\nBill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a\\nbedsheet to his arm, which was bleeding profusely.\\nCharlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was\\nsporting a bloody nose. Fred, George, and Ginny\\nlooked unhurt, though shaken.\\n“Did you get them, Dad?” said Bill sharply. “The\\nperson who conjured the Mark?”\\n“No,” said Mr. Weasley. “We found Barty Crouch’s elf\\nholding Harry’s wand, but we’re none the wiser about\\nwho actually conjured the Mark.”\\n“What?” said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together.\\n“Harry’s wand?” said Fred.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Mr. Crouch’s elf?” said Percy, sounding\\nthunderstruck.\\nWith some assistance from Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione, Mr. Weasley explained what had happened\\nin the woods. When they had finished their story,\\nPercy swelled indignantly.\\n“Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like\\nthat!” he said. “Running away when he’d expressly\\ntold her not to ... embarrassing him in front of the\\nwhole Ministry . . . how would that have looked, if\\nshe’d been brought up in front of the Department for\\nthe Regulation and Control — ”\\n“She didn’t do anything — she was just in the wrong\\nplace at the wrong time!” Hermione snapped at Percy,\\nwho looked very taken aback. Hermione had always\\ngot on fairly well with Percy — better, indeed, than\\nany of the others.\\n“Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch’s position can’t\\nafford a house-elf who’s going to run amok with a\\nwand!” said Percy pompously, recovering himself.\\n“She didn’t run amok!” shouted Hermione. “She just\\npicked it up off the ground!”\\n“Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing\\nwas?” said Ron impatiently. “It wasn’t hurting\\nanyone. ... Why’s it such a big deal?”\\n“I told you, it’s You-Know-Who’s symbol, Ron,” said\\nHermione, before anyone else could answer. “I read\\nabout it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.”\\n“And it hasn’t been seen for thirteen years,” said Mr.\\nWeasley quietly. “Of course people panicked ... it was\\nalmost like seeing You-Know-Who back again.”\\n \\n“I don’t get it,” said Ron, frowning. “I mean ... it’s still\\nonly a shape in the sky. ...”\\n“Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark\\nMark into the air whenever they killed,” said Mr.\\nWeasley. “The terror it inspired ... you have no idea,\\nyou’re too young. Just picture coming home and\\nfinding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and\\nknowing what you’re about to find inside. ...” Mr.\\nWeasley winced. “Everyone’s worst fear ... the very\\nworst ...”\\nThere was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing\\nthe sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said,\\n“Well, it didn’t help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It\\nscared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw\\nit. They all Disapparated before we’d got near enough\\nto unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses\\nbefore they hit the ground, though. They’re having\\ntheir memories modified right now.”\\n“Death Eaters?” said Harry. “What are Death Eaters?”\\n“It’s what You-Know- Who’s supporters called\\nthemselves,” said Bill. “I think we saw what’s left of\\nthem tonight — the ones who managed to keep\\nthemselves out of Azkaban, anyway.”\\n“We can’t prove it was them, Bill,” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“Though it probably was,” he added hopelessly.\\n“Yeah, I bet it was!” said Ron suddenly. “Dad, we met\\nDraco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us\\nhis dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all\\nknow the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!”\\n“But what were Voldemort’s supporters — ” Harry\\nbegan. Everybody flinched — like most of the\\nwizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying\\n \\nVoldemort’s name. “Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “What\\nwere You -Know- Who’s supporters up to, levitating\\nMuggles? I mean, what was the point?”\\n“The point?” said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh.\\n“Harry, that’s their idea of fun. Half the Muggle\\nkillings back when You-Know-Who was in power were\\ndone for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight\\nand couldn’t resist reminding us all that lots of them\\nare still at large. A nice little reunion for them,” he\\nfinished disgustedly.\\n“But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they\\nDisapparate when they saw the Dark Mark?” said\\nRon. “They’d have been pleased to see it, wouldn’t\\nthey?”\\n“Use your brains, Ron,” said Bill. “If they really were\\nDeath Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of\\nAzkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all\\nsorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture\\npeople. I bet they’d be even more frightened than the\\nrest of us to see him come back. They denied they’d\\never been involved with him when he lost his powers,\\nand went back to their daily lives. ... I don’t reckon\\nhe’d be over-pleased with them, do you?”\\n“So ... whoever conjured the Dark Mark ...” said\\nHermione slowly, “were they doing it to show support\\nfor the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?”\\n“Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione,” said Mr.\\nWeasley. “But I’ll tell you this ... it was only the Death\\nEaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I’d be very\\nsurprised if the person who did it hadn’t been a Death\\nEater once, even if they’re not now. ... Listen, it’s very\\nlate, and if your mother hears what’s happened she’ll\\nbe worried sick. We’ll get a few more hours sleep and\\nthen try and get an early Portkey out of here.”\\n \\nHarry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing.\\nHe knew he ought to feel exhausted: It was nearly\\nthree in the morning, but he felt wide-awake — wide-\\nawake, and worried.\\nThree days ago — it felt like much longer, but it had\\nonly been three days — he had awoken with his scar\\nburning. And tonight, for the first time in thirteen\\nyears, Lord Voldemort’s mark had appeared in the\\nsky. What did these things mean?\\nHe thought of the letter he had written to Sirius\\nbefore leaving Privet Drive. Would Sirius have gotten\\nit yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up at\\nthe canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now\\nto ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after\\nCharlie’s snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed\\noff.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n10\\nMAYHEM AT THE MINISTRY\\nMr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep.\\nHe used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the\\ncampsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts\\nat the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange,\\ndazed look about him, and he waved them off with a\\nvague “Merry Christmas.”\\n“Hell be all right,” said Mr. Weasley quietly as they\\nmarched off onto the moor. “Sometimes, when a\\nperson’s memory’s modified, it makes him a bit\\ndisorientated for a while . . . and that was a big thing\\nthey had to make him forget.”\\nThey heard urgent voices as they approached the spot\\nwhere the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it,\\nthey found a great number of witches and wizards\\ngathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all\\nclamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as\\npossible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with\\nBasil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an\\nold rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun\\nhad really risen. They walked back through Ottery St.\\n \\nCatchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow\\nin the dawn light, talking very little because they were\\nso exhausted, and thinking longingly of their\\nbreakfast. As they rounded the corner and the\\nBurrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.\\n“Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!”\\nMrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for\\nthem in the front yard, came running toward them,\\nstill wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale and\\nstrained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily Prophet\\nclutched in her hand.\\n“Arthur — I’ve been so worried — so worried — ”\\nShe flung her arms around Mr. Weasley’s neck, and\\nthe Daily Prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the\\nground. Looking down, Harry saw the headline:\\nSCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD\\nCUP, complete with a twinkling black-and-white\\nphotograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops.\\n“You’re all right,” Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly,\\nreleasing Mr. Weasley and staring around at them all\\nwith red eyes, “you’re alive. ... Oh boys ...”\\nAnd to everybody’s surprise, she seized Fred and\\nGeorge and pulled them both into such a tight hug\\nthat their heads banged together.\\n“ Ouch\\\\ Mum — you’re strangling us — ”\\n“I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs. Weasley said,\\nstarting to sob. “It’s all I’ve been thinking about! What\\nif You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I\\never said to you was that you didn’t get enough\\nO.W.L.s? Oh Fred ... George ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Come on, now, Molly, we’re all perfectly okay,” said\\nMr. Weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and\\nleading her back toward the house. “Bill,” he added in\\nan undertone, “pick up that paper, I want to see what\\nit says. ...”\\nWhen they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen,\\nand Hermione had made Mrs. Weasley a cup of very\\nstrong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted on\\npouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhiskey, Bill\\nhanded his father the newspaper. Mr. Weasley\\nscanned the front page while Percy looked over his\\nshoulder.\\n“I knew it,” said Mr. Weasley heavily. “Ministry\\nblunders ... culprits not apprehended ... lax security ...\\nDark wizards running unchecked . . . national disgrace\\n... Who wrote this? Ah ... of course ... Rita Skeeter.”\\n“That woman’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic!”\\nsaid Percy furiously. “Last week she was saying we’re\\nwasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness,\\nwhen we should be stamping out vampires! As if it\\nwasn’t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the\\nGuidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-\\nHumans — ”\\n“Do us a favor, Perce,” said Bill, yawning, “and shut\\nup.”\\n“I’m mentioned,” said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening\\nbehind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the\\nDaily Prophet article.\\n“Where?” spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea\\nand whiskey. “If I’d seen that, I’d have known you\\nwere alive!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Not by name,” said Mr. Weasley. “Listen to this: ‘If\\nthe terrified wizards and witches who waited\\nbreathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected\\nreassurance from the Ministry of Magic, they were\\nsadly disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some\\ntime after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging\\nthat nobody had been hurt, but refusing to give any\\nmore information. Whether this statement will be\\nenough to quash the rumors that several bodies were\\nremoved from the woods an hour later, remains to be\\nseen.’ Oh really,” said Mr. Weasley in exasperation,\\nhanding the paper to Percy. “Nobody was hurt. What\\nwas I supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies\\nwere removed from the woods ... well, there certainly\\nwill be rumors now she’s printed that.”\\nHe heaved a deep sigh. “Molly, I’m going to have to go\\ninto the office; this is going to take some smoothing\\nover.”\\n“I’ll come with you, Father,” said Percy importantly.\\n“Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck. And I can\\ngive him my cauldron report in person.”\\nHe bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked\\nmost upset.\\n“Arthur, you’re supposed to be on holiday! This hasn’t\\ngot anything to do with your office; surely they can\\nhandle this without you?”\\n“I’ve got to go, Molly,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’ve made\\nthings worse. I’ll just change into my robes and I’ll be\\noff. ...”\\n“Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry suddenly, unable to\\ncontain himself, “Hedwig hasn’t arrived with a letter\\nfor me, has she?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Hedwig, dear?” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. “No ...\\nno, there hasn’t been any post at all.”\\nRon and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a\\nmeaningful look at both of them he said, “All right if I\\ngo and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?”\\n“Yeah ... think I will too,” said Ron at once.\\n“Hermione?”\\n“Yes,” she said quickly, and the three of them\\nmarched out of the kitchen and up the stairs.\\n“What’s up, Harry?” said Ron, the moment they had\\nclosed the door of the attic room behind them.\\n“There’s something I haven’t told you,” Harry said.\\n“On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar\\nhurting again.”\\nRon’s and Hermione’s reactions were almost exactly\\nas Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on\\nPrivet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making\\nsuggestions at once, mentioning a number of\\nreference books, and everybody from Albus\\nDumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse.\\nRon simply looked dumbstruck.\\n“But — he wasn’t there, was he? You-Know-Who? I\\nmean — last time your scar kept hurting, he was at\\nHogwarts, wasn’t he?”\\n“I’m sure he wasn’t on Privet Drive,” said Harry. “But I\\nwas dreaming about him . . . him and Peter — you\\nknow, Wormtail. I can’t remember all of it now, but\\nthey were plotting to kill ... someone.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHe had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying\\n“me,” but couldn’t bring himself to make Hermione\\nlook any more horrified than she already did.\\n“It was only a dream,” said Ron bracingly. “Just a\\nnightmare.”\\n“Yeah, but was it, though?” said Harry, turning to\\nlook out of the window at the brightening sky. “It’s\\nweird, isn’t it? ... My scar hurts, and three days later\\nthe Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort’s\\nsign’s up in the sky again.”\\n“Don’t — say — his — name!” Ron hissed through\\ngritted teeth.\\n“And remember what Professor Trelawney said?”\\nHarry went on, ignoring Ron. “At the end of last\\nyear?”\\nProfessor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at\\nHogwarts. Hermione ’s terrified look vanished as she\\nlet out a derisive snort.\\n“Oh Harry, you aren’t going to pay attention to\\nanything that old fraud says?”\\n“You weren’t there,” said Harry. “You didn’t hear her.\\nThis time was different. I told you, she went into a\\ntrance — a real one. And she said the Dark Lord\\nwould rise again . . . greater and more terrible than ever\\nbefore ... and he’d manage it because his servant was\\ngoing to go back to him ... and that night Wormtail\\nescaped.”\\nThere was a silence in which Ron fidgeted\\nabsentmindedly with a hole in his Chudley Cannons\\nbedspread.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?”\\nHermione asked. “Are you expecting a letter?”\\n“I told Sirius about my scar,” said Harry, shrugging.\\n“I’m waiting for his answer.”\\n“Good thinking!” said Ron, his expression clearing. “I\\nbet Sirius ’ll know what to do!”\\n“I hoped he’d get back to me quickly,” said Harry.\\n“But we don’t know where Sirius is ... he could be in\\nAfrica or somewhere, couldn’t he?” said Hermione\\nreasonably. “Hedwig’s not going to manage that\\njourney in a few days.”\\n“Yeah, I know,” said Harry, but there was a leaden\\nfeeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window\\nat the Hedwig-free sky.\\n“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard,\\nHarry,” said Ron. “Come on — three on three, Bill and\\nCharlie and Fred and George will play. ... You can try\\nout the Wronski Feint. ...”\\n“Ron,” said Hermione, in an I-don’t-think-you’re-\\nbeing- very- sensitive sort of voice, “Harry doesn’t want\\nto play Quidditch right now. ... He’s worried, and he’s\\ntired. ... We all need to go to bed. ...”\\n“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry\\nsuddenly. “Hang on, I’ll get my Firebolt.”\\nHermione left the room, muttering something that\\nsounded very much like “Boys.”\\nk k k\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nNeither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much\\nover the following week. Both left the house each\\nmorning before the rest of the family got up, and\\nreturned well after dinner every night.\\n“It’s been an absolute uproar,” Percy told them\\nimportantly the Sunday evening before they were due\\nto return to Hogwarts. “I’ve been putting out fires all\\nweek. People keep sending Howlers, and of course, if\\nyou don’t open a Howler straight away, it explodes.\\nScorch marks all over my desk and my best quill\\nreduced to cinders.”\\n“Why are they all sending Howlers?” asked Ginny,\\nwho was mending her copy of One Thousand Magical\\nHerbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in front of\\nthe living room fire.\\n“Complaining about security at the World Cup,” said\\nPercy. “They want compensation for their ruined\\nproperty. Mundungus Fletcher’s put in a claim for a\\ntwelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi, but I’ve\\ngot his number. I know for a fact he was sleeping\\nunder a cloak propped on sticks.”\\nMrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the\\ncorner. Harry liked this clock. It was completely\\nuseless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise\\nvery informative. It had nine golden hands, and each\\nof them was engraved with one of the Weasley family’s\\nnames. There were no numerals around the face, but\\ndescriptions of where each family member might be.\\n“Home,” “school,” and “work” were there, but there\\nwas also “traveling,” “lost,” “hospital,” “prison,” and,\\nin the position where the number twelve would be on\\na normal clock, “mortal peril.”\\nEight of the hands were currently pointing to the\\n“home” position, but Mr. Weasley’s, which was the\\n \\nlongest, was still pointing to “work.” Mrs. Weasley\\nsighed.\\n“Your father hasn’t had to go into the office on\\nweekends since the days of You-Know-Who,” she said.\\n“They’re working him far too hard. His dinner’s going\\nto be mined if he doesn’t come home soon.”\\n“Well, Father feels he’s got to make up for his mistake\\nat the match, doesn’t he?” said Percy. “If truth be\\ntold, he was a tad unwise to make a public statement\\nwithout clearing it with his Head of Department first\\n“Don’t you dare blame your father for what that\\nwretched Skeeter woman wrote!” said Mrs. Weasley,\\nflaring up at once.\\n“If Dad hadn’t said anything, old Rita would just have\\nsaid it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry\\nhad commented,” said Bill, who was playing chess\\nwith Ron. “Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look\\ngood. Remember, she interviewed all the Gringotts’\\nCharm Breakers once, and called me ‘a long-haired\\npillock’?”\\n“Well, it is a bit long, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley gently.\\n“If you’d just let me — ”\\n“No, Mum.”\\nRain lashed against the living room window.\\nHermione was immersed in The Standard Book of\\nSpells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had\\nbought for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley.\\nCharlie was darning a fireproof balaclava.

Rowling\\nA few moments later, Mr. Weasley came into the\\nwarm living room carrying his dinner on a tray. He\\nlooked completely exhausted.\\n“Well, the fat’s really in the fire now,” he told Mrs.\\nWeasley as he sat down in an armchair near the\\nhearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his\\nsomewhat shriveled cauliflower. “Rita Skeeter’s been\\nferreting around all week, looking for more Ministry\\nmess-ups to report. And now she’s found out about\\npoor old Bertha going missing, so that’ll be the\\nheadline in the Prophet tomorrow. I told Bagman he\\nshould have sent someone to look for her ages ago.”\\n“Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks,”\\nsaid Percy swiftly.\\n“Crouch is very lucky Rita hasn’t found out about\\nWinky,” said Mr. Weasley irritably. “There’d be a\\nweek’s worth of headlines in his house-elf being\\ncaught holding the wand that conjured the Dark\\nMark.”\\n“I thought we were all agreed that that elf, while\\nirresponsible, did not conjure the Mark?” said Percy\\nhotly.\\n“If you ask me, Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the\\nDaily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves!” said\\nHermione angrily.\\n“Now look here, Hermione!” said Percy. “A high-\\nranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves\\nunswerving obedience from his servants — ”\\n“His slave, you mean!” said Hermione, her voice rising\\npassionately, “because he didn’t pay Winky, did he?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K.

The rain sounded even louder at the top of\\nthe house, accompanied by loud whistlings and\\nmoans from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls\\nfrom the ghoul who lived in the attic. Pigwidgeon\\nbegan twittering and zooming around his cage when\\nthey entered. The sight of the half-packed trunks\\nseemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement.\\n“Bung him some Owl Treats,” said Ron, throwing a\\npacket across to Harry. “It might shut him up.”\\nHarry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of\\nPigwidgeon’s cage, then turned to his trunk. Hedwig’s\\ncage stood next to it, still empty.\\n“It’s been over a week,” Harry said, looking at\\nHedwig’s deserted perch. “Ron, you don’t reckon\\nSirius has been caught, do you?”\\n“Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet,” said Ron.\\n“The Ministry would want to show they’d caught\\nsomeone, wouldn’t they?”\\n“Yeah, I suppose. ...”\\n“Look, here’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon\\nAlley. And she’s got some gold out of your vault for\\nyou ... and she’s washed all your socks.”\\nHe heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry’s camp bed\\nand dropped the money bag and a load of socks next\\nto it. Harry started unwrapping the shopping. Apart\\nfrom The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by\\n \\nMiranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a\\ndozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-\\nmaking kit — he had been running low on spine of\\nlionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling\\nunderwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud\\nnoise of disgust behind him.\\n“What is that supposed to be?”\\nHe was holding up something that looked to Harry\\nlike a long, maroon velvet dress. It had a moldy-\\nlooking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs.\\nThere was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley\\nentered, carrying an armful of freshly laundered\\nHogwarts robes.\\n“Here you are,” she said, sorting them into two piles.\\n“Now, mind you pack them properly so they don’t\\ncrease.”\\n“Mum, you’ve given me Ginny’s new dress,” said Ron,\\nhanding it out to her.\\n“Of course I haven’t,” said Mrs. Weasley. “That’s for\\nyou. Dress robes.”\\n“What?” said Ron, looking horror-struck.\\n“Dress robes!” repeated Mrs. Weasley. “It says on your\\nschool list that you’re supposed to have dress robes\\nthis year ... robes for formal occasions.”\\n“You’ve got to be kidding,” said Ron in disbelief. “I’m\\nnot wearing that, no way.”\\n“Everyone wears them, Ron!” said Mrs. Weasley\\ncrossly. “They’re all like that! Your father’s got some\\nfor smart parties!”\\n \\n“I’ll go starkers before I put that on,” said Ron\\nstubbornly.\\n“Don’t be so silly,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’ve got to\\nhave dress robes, they’re on your list! I got some for\\nHarry too ... show him, Harry. ...”\\nIn some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on\\nhis camp bed. It wasn’t as bad as he had expected,\\nhowever; his dress robes didn’t have any lace on them\\nat all — in fact, they were more or less the same as\\nhis school ones, except that they were bottle green\\ninstead of black.\\n“I thought they’d bring out the color of your eyes,\\ndear,” said Mrs. Weasley fondly.\\n“Well, they’re okay!” said Ron angrily, looking at\\nHarry’s robes. “Why couldn’t I have some like that?”\\n“Because ... well, I had to get yours secondhand, and\\nthere wasn’t a lot of choice!” said Mrs. Weasley,\\nflushing.\\nHarry looked away. He would willingly have split all\\nthe money in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys,\\nbut he knew they would never take it.\\n“I’m never wearing them,” Ron was saying stubbornly.\\n“Never.”\\n“Fine,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “Go naked. And, Harry,\\nmake sure you get a picture of him. Goodness knows\\nI could do with a laugh.”\\nShe left the room, slamming the door behind her.\\nThere was a funny spluttering noise from behind\\nthem. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl\\nTreat.\\n \\n“Why is everything I own rubbish?” said Ron\\nfuriously, striding across the room to unstick\\nPigwidgeon’s beak.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nABOARD THE HOGWARTS EXPRESS\\nThere was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the\\nair when Harry awoke next morning. Heavy rain was\\nstill splattering against the window as he got dressed\\nin jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into\\ntheir school robes on the Hogwarts Express.\\nHe, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-\\nfloor landing on their way down to breakfast, when\\nMrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs,\\nlooking harassed.\\n“Arthur!” she called up the staircase. “Arthur! Urgent\\nmessage from the Ministry!”\\nHarry flattened himself against the wall as Mr.\\nWeasley came clattering past with his robes on back-\\nto-front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the\\nothers entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley\\nrummaging anxiously in the drawers — “I’ve got a\\nquill here somewhere!” — and Mr. Weasley bending\\nover the fire, talking to —\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to\\nmake sure that they were working properly.\\nAmos Diggory’s head was sitting in the middle of the\\nflames like a large, bearded egg. It was talking very\\nfast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying\\naround it and the flames licking its ears.\\n\"... Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so\\nthey went and called those what-d’you-call-’ems —\\nplease-men. Arthur, you’ve got to get over there — ”\\n“Here!” said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a\\npiece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled\\nquill into Mr. Weasley’s hands.\\n“ — it’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it,” said Mr.\\nDiggory’s head. “I had to come into the office early to\\nsend a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use\\nof Magic lot all setting off — if Rita Skeeter gets hold\\nof this one, Arthur — ”\\n“What does Mad-Eye say happened?” asked Mr.\\nWeasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his\\nquill, and preparing to take notes.\\nMr. Diggory’s head rolled its eyes. “Says he heard an\\nintruder in his yard. Says he was creeping toward the\\nhouse, but was ambushed by his dustbins.”\\n“What did the dustbins do?” asked Mr. Weasley,\\nscribbling frantically.\\n“Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish\\neverywhere, as far as I can tell,” said Mr. Diggory.\\n“Apparently one of them was still rocketing around\\nwhen the please-men turned up — ”\\nMr. Weasley groaned.\\n \\n“And what about the intruder?”\\n“Arthur, you know Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Diggory’s head,\\nrolling its eyes again. “Someone creeping into his yard\\nin the dead of night? More likely there’s a very shell-\\nshocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in\\npotato peelings. But if the Improper Use of Magic lot\\nget their hands on Mad-Eye, he’s had it — think of\\nhis record — we’ve got to get him off on a minor\\ncharge, something in your department — what are\\nexploding dustbins worth?”\\n“Might be a caution,” said Mr. Weasley, still writing\\nvery fast, his brow furrowed. “Mad-Eye didn’t use his\\nwand? He didn’t actually attack anyone?”\\n“I’ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing\\neverything he could reach through the window,” said\\nMr. Diggory, “but they’ll have a job proving it, there\\naren’t any casualties.”\\n“All right, I’m off,” Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed\\nthe parchment with his notes on it into his pocket\\nand dashed out of the kitchen again.\\nMr. Diggory’s head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.\\n“Sorry about this, Molly,” it said, more calmly,\\n“bothering you so early and everything . . . but Arthur’s\\nthe only one who can get Mad-Eye off, and Mad-Eye’s\\nsupposed to be starting his new job today. Why he\\nhad to choose last night ...”\\n“Never mind, Amos,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sure you\\nwon’t have a bit of toast or anything before you go?”\\n“Oh go on, then,” said Mr. Diggory.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nMrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a\\nstack on the kitchen table, put it into the fire tongs,\\nand transferred it into Mr. Diggory’s mouth.\\n“Fanks,” he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a\\nsmall pop, vanished.\\nHarry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good-\\nbyes to Bill, Charlie, Percy, and the girls. Within five\\nminutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes on the\\nright way now, dragging a comb through his hair.\\n“I’d better hurry — you have a good term, boys,” said\\nMr. Weasley to Harry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a\\ncloak over his shoulders and preparing to\\nDisapparate. “Molly, are you going to be all right\\ntaking the kids to King’s Cross?”\\n“Of course I will,” she said. “You just look after Mad-\\nEye, we’ll be fine.”\\nAs Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the\\nkitchen.\\n“Did someone say Mad-Eye?” Bill asked. “What’s he\\nbeen up to now?\\n“He says someone tried to break into his house last\\nnight,” said Mrs. Weasley.\\n“Mad-Eye Moody?” said George thoughtfully,\\nspreading marmalade on his toast. “Isn’t he that\\nnutter — ”\\n“Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,”\\nsaid Mrs. Weasley sternly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn’t he?” said Fred\\nquietly as Mrs. Weasley left the room. “Birds of a\\nfeather ...”\\n“Moody was a great wizard in his time,” said Bill.\\n“He’s an old friend of Dumbledore’s, isn’t he?” said\\nCharlie.\\n“Dumbledore’s not what you’d call normal, though, is\\nhe?” said Fred. “I mean, I know he’s a genius and\\neverything ...”\\n“Who is Mad-Eye?” asked Harry.\\n“He’s retired, used to work at the Ministry,” said\\nCharlie. “I met him once when Dad took me into work\\nwith him. He was an Auror — one of the best ... a\\nDark wizard catcher,” he added, seeing Harry’s blank\\nlook. “Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of\\nhim. He made himself loads of enemies, though ... the\\nfamilies of people he caught, mainly . . . and I heard\\nhe’s been getting really paranoid in his old age.\\nDoesn’t trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark wizards\\neverywhere.”\\nBill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off\\nat King’s Cross station, but Percy, apologizing most\\nprofusely, said that he really needed to get to work.\\n“I just can’t justify taking more time off at the\\nmoment,” he told them. “Mr. Crouch is really starting\\nto rely on me.”\\n“Yeah, you know what, Percy?” said George seriously.\\n“I reckon he’ll know your name soon.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nMrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village\\npost office to order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take\\nthem into London.\\n“Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,” Mrs.\\nWeasley whispered to Harry as they stood in the rain-\\nwashed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six\\nheavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars. “But there\\nweren’t any to spare. ... Oh dear, they don’t look\\nhappy, do they?”\\nHarry didn’t like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi\\ndrivers rarely transported overexcited owls, and\\nPigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket. Nor\\ndid it help that a number of Filibuster’s Fabulous\\nWet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks went off unexpectedly\\nwhen Fred’s trunk sprang open, causing the driver\\ncarrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks\\nclawed his way up the man’s leg.\\nThe journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that\\nthey were jammed in the back of the taxis with their\\ntrunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover\\nfrom the fireworks, and by the time they entered\\nLondon, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all severely\\nscratched. They were very relieved to get out at King’s\\nCross, even though the rain was coming down harder\\nthan ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks\\nacross the busy road and into the station.\\nHarry was used to getting onto platform nine and\\nthree-quarters by now. It was a simple matter of\\nwalking straight through the apparently solid barrier\\ndividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part\\nwas doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid\\nattracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups\\ntoday; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most\\nconspicuous, since they were accompanied by\\nPigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned\\n \\ncasually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly,\\nand slid sideways through it ... and as they did so,\\nplatform nine and three-quarters materialized in front\\nof them.\\nThe Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam\\nengine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing\\nfrom it, through which the many Hogwarts students\\nand parents on the platform appeared like dark\\nghosts. Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in\\nresponse to the hooting of many owls through the\\nmist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats,\\nand were soon stowing their luggage in a\\ncompartment halfway along the train. They then\\nhopped back down onto the platform to say good-bye\\nto Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.\\n“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,”\\nsaid Charlie, grinning, as he hugged Ginny good-bye.\\n“Why?” said Fred keenly.\\n“You’ll see,” said Charlie. “Just don’t tell Percy I\\nmentioned it ... it’s ‘classified information, until such\\ntime as the Ministry sees fit to release it,’ after all.”\\n“Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this\\nyear,” said Bill, hands in his pockets, looking almost\\nwistfully at the train.\\n“Why?” said George impatiently.\\n“You’re going to have an interesting year,” said Bill,\\nhis eyes twinkling. “I might even get time off to come\\nand watch a bit of it. ...”\\n“A bit of what?” said Ron.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBut at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs.\\nWeasley chivvied them toward the train doors.\\n“Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,” said\\nHermione as they climbed on board, closed the door,\\nand leaned out of the window to talk to her.\\n“Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,” said\\nHarry.\\n“Oh it was my pleasure, dears,” said Mrs. Weasley.\\n“Td invite you for Christmas, but ... well, I expect\\nyou’re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what\\nwith ... one thing and another.”\\n“Mum!” said Ron irritably. “What d’you three know\\nthat we don’t?”\\n“You’ll find out this evening, I expect,” said Mrs.\\nWeasley, smiling. “It’s going to be very exciting —\\nmind you, I’m very glad they’ve changed the rules — ”\\n“What rules?” said Harry, Ron, Fred, and George\\ntogether.\\n“I’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. ... Now,\\nbehave, won’t you? Won’t you, Fred? And you,\\nGeorge?”\\nThe pistons hissed loudly and the train began to\\nmove.\\n“Tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts!” Fred\\nbellowed out of the window as Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and\\nCharlie sped away from them. “What rules are they\\nchanging?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBut Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the\\ntrain had rounded the corner, she, Bill, and Charlie\\nhad Disapparated.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their\\ncompartment. The thick rain splattering the windows\\nmade it very difficult to see out of them. Ron undid\\nhis trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and\\nflung them over Pigwidgeon’s cage to muffle his\\nhooting.\\n“Bagman wanted to tell us what’s happening at\\nHogwarts,” he said grumpily, sitting down next to\\nHarry. “At the World Cup, remember? But my own\\nmother won’t say. Wonder what — ”\\n“Shh!” Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her\\nfinger to her lips and pointing toward the\\ncompartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron listened,\\nand heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in\\nthrough the open door.\\n\"... Father actually considered sending me to\\nDurmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He\\nknows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his\\nopinion of Dumbledore — the man’s such a\\nMudblood-lover — and Durmstrang doesn’t admit\\nthat sort of riffraff. But Mother didn’t like the idea of\\nme going to school so far away. Father says\\nDurmstrang takes a far more sensible line than\\nHogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students\\nactually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we\\ndo. ...”\\nHermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door,\\nand slid it shut, blocking out Malfoy’s voice.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him,\\ndoes he?” she said angrily. “I wish he had gone, then\\nwe wouldn’t have to put up with him.”\\n“Durmstrang’s another wizarding school?” said Harry.\\n“Yes,” said Hermione sniffily, “and it’s got a horrible\\nreputation. According to An Appraisal of Magical\\nEducation in Europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the\\nDark Arts.”\\n“I think I’ve heard of it,” said Ron vaguely. “Where is\\nit? What country?”\\n“Well, nobody knows, do they?” said Hermione,\\nraising her eyebrows.\\n“Er — why not?” said Harry.\\n“There’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all\\nthe magic schools. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like\\nto conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal\\ntheir secrets,” said Hermione matter-of-factly.\\n“Come off it,” said Ron, starting to laugh.\\n“Durmstrang’s got to be about the same size as\\nHogwarts — how are you going to hide a great big\\ncastle?”\\n“But Hogwarts is hidden,” said Hermione, in surprise.\\n“Everyone knows that ... well, everyone who’s read\\nHogwarts, A History, anyway.”\\n“Just you, then,” said Ron. “So go on — how d’you\\nhide a place like Hogwarts?”\\n“It’s bewitched,” said Hermione. “If a Muggle looks at\\nit, all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nthe entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT ENTER,\\nUNSAFE.”\\n“So Durmstrangll just look like a min to an outsider\\ntoo?”\\n“Maybe,” said Hermione, shrugging, “or it might have\\nMuggle-repelling charms on it, like the World Cup\\nstadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it,\\nthey’ll have made it Unplottable — ”\\n“Come again?”\\n“Well, you can enchant a building so it’s impossible to\\nplot on a map, can’t you?”\\n“Er ... if you say so,” said Harry.\\n“But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the\\nfar north,” said Hermione thoughtfully. “Somewhere\\nvery cold, because they’ve got fur capes as part of\\ntheir uniforms.”\\n“Ah, think of the possibilities,” said Ron dreamily. “It\\nwould’ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and\\nmake it look like an accident. ... Shame his mother\\nlikes him. ...”\\nThe rain became heavier and heavier as the train\\nmoved farther north. The sky was so dark and the\\nwindows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by\\nmidday. The lunch trolley came rattling along the\\ncorridor, and Harry bought a large stack of Cauldron\\nCakes for them to share.\\nSeveral of their friends looked in on them as the\\nafternoon progressed, including Seamus Finnigan,\\nDean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a round-\\nfaced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought\\n \\nup by his formidable witch of a grandmother. Seamus\\nwas still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its\\nmagic seemed to be wearing off now; it was still\\nsqueaking “ Troy — Mullet — Moran\\\\” but in a very\\nfeeble and exhausted sort of way. After half an hour\\nor so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless\\nQuidditch talk, buried herself once more in The\\nStandard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying\\nto learn a Summoning Charm.\\nNeville listened jealously to the others’ conversation\\nas they relived the Cup match.\\n“Gran didn’t want to go,” he said miserably. “Wouldn’t\\nbuy tickets. It sounded amazing though.”\\n“It was,” said Ron. “Look at this, Neville. ...”\\nHe rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and\\npulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.\\n“Oh wow,” said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum\\nonto his pudgy hand.\\n“We saw him right up close, as well,” said Ron. “We\\nwere in the Top Box — ”\\n“For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.”\\nDraco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind\\nhim stood Crabbe and Goyle, his enormous, thuggish\\ncronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at\\nleast a foot during the summer. Evidently they had\\noverheard the conversation through the compartment\\ndoor, which Dean and Seamus had left ajar.\\n“Don’t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,” said\\nHarry coolly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Weasley ... what is that?” said Malfoy, pointing at\\nPigwidgeon’s cage. A sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was\\ndangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train,\\nthe moldy lace cuff very obvious.\\nRon made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy\\nwas too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and\\npulled.\\n“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up\\nRon’s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley,\\nyou weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you? I\\nmean — they were very fashionable in about eighteen\\nninety. ...”\\n“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the\\ndress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy’s\\ngrip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe\\nand Goyle guffawed stupidly.\\n“So ... going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring\\na bit of glory to the family name? There’s money\\ninvolved as well, you know ... you’d be able to afford\\nsome decent robes if you won. ...”\\n“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.\\n“ Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated. “I suppose\\nyou will, Potter? You never miss a chance to show off,\\ndo you?”\\n“Either explain what you’re on about or go away,\\nMalfoy,” said Hermione testily, over the top of The\\nStandard Book of Spells, Grade 4.\\nA gleeful smile spread across Malfoy’s pale face.\\n“Don’t tell me you don’t know?” he said delightedly.\\n“You’ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and\\n \\nyou don’t even know ? My God, my father told me\\nabout it ages ago ... heard it from Cornelius Fudge.\\nBut then, Father’s always associated with the top\\npeople at the Ministry. . . . Maybe your father’s too\\njunior to know about it, Weasley ... yes ... they\\nprobably don’t talk about important stuff in front of\\nhim. ...”\\nLaughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and\\nGoyle, and the three of them disappeared.\\nRon got to his feet and slammed the sliding\\ncompartment door so hard behind them that the glass\\nshattered.\\n“Ronl” said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled\\nout her wand, muttered “ ReparoV ’ and the glass\\nshards flew back into a single pane and back into the\\ndoor.\\n“Well ... making it look like he knows everything and\\nwe don’t. ...” Ron snarled. “ ‘Father’s always\\nassociated with the top people at the Ministry.’... Dad\\ncould’ve got a promotion any time ... he just likes it\\nwhere he is. ...”\\n“Of course he does,” said Hermione quietly. “Don’t let\\nMalfoy get to you, Ron — ”\\n“Him! Get to me!? As if!” said Ron, picking up one of\\nthe remaining Cauldron Cakes and squashing it into\\na pulp.\\nRon’s bad mood continued for the rest of the journey.\\nHe didn’t talk much as they changed into their school\\nrobes, and was still glowering when the Hogwarts\\nExpress slowed down at last and finally stopped in\\nthe pitch-darkness of Hogsmeade station.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nAs the train doors opened, there was a rumble of\\nthunder overhead. Hermione bundled up\\nCrookshanks in her cloak and Ron left his dress\\nrobes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads\\nbent and eyes narrowed against the downpour. The\\nrain was now coming down so thick and fast that it\\nwas as though buckets of ice-cold water were being\\nemptied repeatedly over their heads.\\n“Hi, Hagrid!” Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette\\nat the far end of the platform.\\n“All righ’, Harry?” Hagrid bellowed back, waving. “See\\nyeh at the feast if we don’ drown!”\\nFirst years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by\\nsailing across the lake with Hagrid.\\n“Oooh, I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this\\nweather,” said Hermione fervently, shivering as they\\ninched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of\\nthe crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood\\nwaiting for them outside the station. Harry, Ron,\\nHermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into one of\\nthem, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments\\nlater, with a great lurch, the long procession of\\ncarriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the\\ntrack toward Hogwarts Castle.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT\\nThrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged\\nboars, and up the sweeping drive the carriages\\ntrundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast\\nbecoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry\\ncould see Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted\\nwindows blurred and shimmering behind the thick\\ncurtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as\\ntheir carriage came to a halt before the great oak front\\ndoors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps.\\nPeople who had occupied the carriages in front were\\nalready hurrying up the stone steps into the castle.\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from\\ntheir carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up\\nonly when they were safely inside the cavernous,\\ntorch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble\\nstaircase.\\n“Blimey,” said Ron, shaking his head and sending\\nwater everywhere, “if that keeps up the lake’s going to\\noverflow. I’m soak — ARRGH!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nA large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from\\nout of the ceiling onto Ron’s head and exploded.\\nDrenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways\\ninto Harry, just as a second water bomb dropped —\\nnarrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry’s feet,\\nsending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into\\nhis socks. People all around them shrieked and\\nstarted pushing one another in their efforts to get out\\nof the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating\\ntwenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little\\nman in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his\\nwide, malicious face contorted with concentration as\\nhe took aim again.\\n“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down\\nhere at ONCE!”\\nProfessor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress and\\nhead of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of\\nthe Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and\\ngrabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself\\nfrom falling.\\n“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger — ”\\n“That’s all right, Professor!” Hermione gasped,\\nmassaging her throat.\\n“Peeves, get down here NOW!” barked Professor\\nMcGonagall, straightening her pointed hat and\\nglaring upward through her square-rimmed\\nspectacles.\\n“Not doing nothing!” cackled Peeves, lobbing a water\\nbomb at several fifth-year girls, who screamed and\\ndived into the Great Hall. “Already wet, aren’t they?\\nLittle squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!” And he aimed another\\nbomb at a group of second years who had just\\narrived.\\n \\n“I shall call the headmaster!” shouted Professor\\nMcGonagall. “I’m warning you, Peeves — ”\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his\\nwater bombs into the air, and zoomed off up the\\nmarble staircase, cackling insanely.\\n“Well, move along, then!” said Professor McGonagall\\nsharply to the bedraggled crowd. “Into the Great Hall,\\ncome on!”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the\\nentrance hall and through the double doors on the\\nright, Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he\\npushed his sopping hair off his face.\\nThe Great Hall looked its usual splendid self,\\ndecorated for the start-of-term feast. Golden plates\\nand goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and\\nhundreds of candles, floating over the tables in\\nmidair. The four long House tables were packed with\\nchattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff\\nsat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils.\\nIt was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione walked past the Slytherins, the\\nRavenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with\\nthe rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall,\\nnext to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost.\\nPearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed\\ntonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly\\nlarge ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking\\nextra-festive, and insuring that his head didn’t wobble\\ntoo much on his partially severed neck.\\n“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them.\\n“Says who?” said Harry, taking off his sneakers and\\nemptying them of water. “Hope they hurry up with the\\nSorting. I’m starving.”\\n \\nThe Sorting of the new students into Houses took\\nplace at the start of every school year, but by an\\nunlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t\\nbeen present at one since his own. He was quite\\nlooking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited,\\nbreathless voice called down the table.\\n“Hiya, Harry!”\\nIt was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was\\nsomething of a hero.\\n“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.\\n“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s\\nstarting! My brother Dennis!”\\n“Er — good,” said Harry.\\n“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing\\nup and down in his seat. “I just hope he’s in\\nGryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”\\n“Er — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to\\nHermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers\\nand sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t\\nthey?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all\\nseven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.\\n“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati\\nPatil’s twin’s in Ravenclaw, and they’re identical.\\nYou’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t you?”\\nHarry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be\\nrather more empty seats there than usual. Hagrid, of\\ncourse, was still fighting his way across the lake with\\nthe first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably\\nsupervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nthere was another empty chair too, and Harry\\ncouldn’t think who else was missing.\\n“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts\\nteacher?” said Hermione, who was also looking up at\\nthe teachers.\\nThey had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark\\nArts teacher who had lasted more than three terms.\\nHarry’s favorite by far had been Professor Lupin, who\\nhad resigned last year. He looked up and down the\\nstaff table. There was definitely no new face there.\\n“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione,\\nlooking anxious.\\nHarry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little\\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on\\na large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the\\nHerbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her\\nflyaway gray hair. She was talking to Professor\\nSinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor\\nSinistra ’s other side was the sallow-faced, hook-\\nnosed, greasy-haired Potions master, Snape —\\nHarry’s least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry’s\\nloathing of Snape was matched only by Snape ’s\\nhatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible,\\nintensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius\\nescape right under Snape ’s overlarge nose — Snape\\nand Sirius had been enemies since their own school\\ndays.\\nOn Snape ’s other side was an empty seat, which\\nHarry guessed was Professor McGonagall’s. Next to it,\\nand in the very center of the table, sat Professor\\nDumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair\\nand beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent\\ndeep green robes embroidered with many stars and\\nmoons. The tips of Dumbledore ’s long, thin fingers\\n \\nwere together and he was resting his chin upon them,\\nstaring up at the ceiling through his half-moon\\nspectacles as though lost in thought. Harry glanced\\nup at the ceiling too. It was enchanted to look like the\\nsky outside, and he had never seen it look this\\nstormy. Black and purple clouds were swirling across\\nit, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a\\nfork of lightning flashed across it.\\n“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, beside Harry, “I could\\neat a hippogriff.”\\nThe words were no sooner out of his mouth than the\\ndoors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell.\\nProfessor McGonagall was leading a long line of first\\nyears up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first\\nyears looked. They appeared to have swum across the\\nlake rather than sailed. All of them were shivering\\nwith a combination of cold and nerves as they filed\\nalong the staff table and came to a halt in a line\\nfacing the rest of the school — all of them except the\\nsmallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was\\nwrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid’s\\nmoleskin overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it\\nlooked as though he were draped in a furry black\\ncircus tent. His small face protruded from over the\\ncollar, looking almost painfully excited. When he had\\nlined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught\\nColin Creevey’s eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and\\nmouthed, I fell in the lake\\\\ He looked positively\\ndelighted about it.\\nProfessor McGonagall now placed a three-legged stool\\non the ground before the first years and, on top of it,\\nan extremely old, dirty, patched wizard’s hat. The first\\nyears stared at it. So did everyone else. For a\\nmoment, there was silence. Then a long tear near the\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nbrim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke\\ninto song:\\nA thousand years or more ago,\\nWhen I was newly sewn,\\nThere lived four wizards of renown,\\nWhose names are still well known:\\nBold Gryffindor, from wild moor,\\nFair Ravenclaw, from glen,\\nSweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,\\nShrewd Slytherin, from fen.\\nThey shared a wish, a hope, a dream,\\nThey hatched a daring plan\\nTo educate young sorcerers\\nThus Hogwarts School began.\\nNow each of these four founders\\nFormed their own house, for each\\nDid value different virtues\\nIn the ones they had to teach.\\nBy Gryffindor, the bravest were\\nPrized far beyond the rest;\\nFor Ravenclaw, the cleverest\\nWould always be the best;\\nFor Hufflepuff, hard workers were\\nMost worthy of admission;\\nAnd power-hungry Slytherin\\nLoved those of great ambition.\\nWhile still alive they did divide\\nTheir favorites from the throng,\\nYet how to pick the worthy ones\\nWhen they were dead and gone?\\nTwas Gryffindor who found the way,\\nHe whipped me off his head\\nThe founders put some brains in me\\nSo I could choose instead!\\nNow slip me snug about your ears,\\nI’ve never yet been wrong,\\n111 have a look inside your mind\\nAnd tell where you belong!\\n \\nThe Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat\\nfinished.\\n“That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,” said\\nHarry, clapping along with everyone else.\\n“Sings a different one every year,” said Ron. “It’s got\\nto be a pretty boring life, hasn’t it, being a hat? I\\nsuppose it spends all year making up the next one.”\\nProfessor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll\\nof parchment.\\n“When I call out your name, you will put on the hat\\nand sit on the stool,” she told the first years. “When\\nthe hat announces your House, you will go and sit at\\nthe appropriate table.\\n“Ackerley, Stewart!”\\nA boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to\\nfoot, picked up the Sorting Hat, put it on, and sat\\ndown on the stool.\\n“RAVENCLAW!” shouted the hat.\\nStewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a\\nseat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was\\napplauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the\\nRavenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he\\nsat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange\\ndesire to join the Ravenclaw table too.\\n“Baddock, Malcolm!”\\n“SLYTHERIN!”\\nThe table on the other side of the hall erupted with\\ncheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock\\n \\njoined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether\\nBaddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out\\nmore Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred\\nand George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.\\n“Branstone, Eleanor!”\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”\\n“Cauldwell, Owen!”\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”\\n“Creevey, Dennis!”\\nTiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over\\nHagrid ’s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into\\nthe Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table.\\nAbout twice as tall as a normal man, and at least\\nthree times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild,\\ntangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming\\n— a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature.\\nHe winked at them as he sat down at the end of the\\nstaff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on\\nthe Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide —\\n“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted.\\nHagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis\\nCreevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it\\nback on the stool, and hurried over to join his\\nbrother.\\n“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into\\nan empty seat. “It was brilliant! And something in the\\nwater grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly. “It was probably\\nthe giant squid, Dennis!”\\n“Wow\\\\” said Dennis, as though nobody in their\\nwildest dreams could hope for more than being\\nthrown into a storm-tossed, fathoms-deep lake, and\\npushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.\\n“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one\\nwith the black hair and glasses? See him? Know who\\nhe is, Dennis ?”\\nHarry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting\\nHat, now Sorting Emma Dobbs.\\nThe Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying\\ndegrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to\\nthe three-legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as\\nProfessor McGonagall passed the L’s.\\n“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.\\n“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than\\nfood,” said Nearly Headless Nick as “Madley, Laura!”\\nbecame a Hufflepuff.\\n“ ’Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.\\n“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to\\nscratch,” said Nearly Headless Nick, applauding as\\n“McDonald, Natalie!” joined the Gryffindor table. “We\\ndon’t want to break our winning streak, do we?”\\nGryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship\\nfor the last three years in a row.\\n“Pritchard, Graham!”\\n“SLYTHERIN!”\\n \\n“Quirke, Orla!”\\n“RAVENCLAW!”\\nAnd finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!” (“HUFFLEPUFF!”),\\nthe Sorting ended. Professor McGonagall picked up\\nthe hat and the stool and carried them away.\\n“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and\\nlooking expectantly at his golden plate.\\nProfessor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was\\nsmiling around at the students, his arms opened wide\\nin welcome.\\n“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them,\\nhis deep voice echoing around the Hall. “ Tuck in.”\\n“Hear, hear!” said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty\\ndishes filled magically before their eyes.\\nNearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione loaded their own plates.\\n“Aaah, ’at’s be’er,” said Ron, with his mouth full of\\nmashed potato.\\n“You’re lucky there’s a feast at all tonight, you know,”\\nsaid Nearly Headless Nick. “There was trouble in the\\nkitchens earlier.”\\n“Why? Wha’ ’appened?” said Harry, through a sizable\\nchunk of steak.\\n“Peeves, of course,” said Nearly Headless Nick,\\nshaking his head, which wobbled dangerously. He\\npulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck. “The\\nusual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the\\nfeast — well, it’s quite out of the question, you know\\n \\nwhat he’s like, utterly uncivilized, can’t see a plate of\\nfood without throwing it. We held a ghost’s council —\\nthe Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but\\nmost wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his\\nfoot down.”\\nThe Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt\\nand silent specter covered in silver bloodstains. He\\nwas the only person at Hogwarts who could really\\ncontrol Peeves.\\n“Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about\\nsomething,” said Ron darkly. “So what did he do in\\nthe kitchens?”\\n“Oh the usual,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging.\\n“Wreaked havoc and mayhem. Pots and pans\\neverywhere. Place swimming in soup. Terrified the\\nhouse-elves out of their wits — ”\\nClang.\\nHermione had knocked over her golden goblet.\\nPumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth,\\nstaining several feet of white linen orange, but\\nHermione paid no attention.\\n“There are house-elves here?” she said, staring,\\nhorror-struck, at Nearly Headless Nick. “Here at\\nHogwarts ?”\\n“Certainly,” said Nearly Headless Nick, looking\\nsurprised at her reaction. “The largest number in any\\ndwelling in Britain, I believe. Over a hundred.”\\n“I’ve never seen one!” said Hermione.\\n“Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do\\nthey?” said Nearly Headless Nick. “They come out at\\n \\nnight to do a bit of cleaning . . . see to the fires and so\\non. ... I mean, you’re not supposed to see them, are\\nyou? That’s the mark of a good house-elf, isn’t it, that\\nyou don’t know it’s there?”\\nHermione stared at him.\\n“But they get paid?” she said. “They get holidays,\\ndon’t they? And — and sick leave, and pensions, and\\neverything?”\\nNearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff\\nslipped and his head flopped off, dangling on the inch\\nor so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it\\nto his neck.\\n“Sick leave and pensions?” he said, pushing his head\\nback onto his shoulders and securing it once more\\nwith his ruff. “House-elves don’t want sick leave and\\npensions!”\\nHermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of\\nfood, then put her knife and fork down upon it and\\npushed it away from her.\\n“Oh c’mon, ’Er-my-knee,” said Ron, accidentally\\nspraying Harry with bits of Yorkshire pudding. “Oops\\n— sorry, ’Arry — ” He swallowed. “You won’t get them\\nsick leave by starving yourself!”\\n“Slave labor,” said Hermione, breathing hard through\\nher nose. “That’s what made this dinner. Slave labor.”\\nAnd she refused to eat another bite.\\nThe rain was still drumming heavily against the high,\\ndark glass. Another clap of thunder shook the\\nwindows, and the stormy ceiling flashed, illuminating\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nthe golden plates as the remains of the first course\\nvanished and were replaced, instantly, with puddings.\\n“Treacle tart, Hermione!” said Ron, deliberately\\nwafting its smell toward her. “Spotted dick, look!\\nChocolate gateau!”\\nBut Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of\\nProfessor McGonagall that he gave up.\\nWhen the puddings too had been demolished, and the\\nlast crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving them\\nsparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to his feet\\nagain. The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased\\nalmost at once, so that only the howling wind and\\npounding rain could be heard.\\n“So!” said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all.\\n“Now that we are all fed and watered,” (“Hmph!” said\\nHermione) “I must once more ask for your attention,\\nwhile I give out a few notices.\\n“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you\\nthat the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has\\nthis year been extended to include Screaming Yo-yos,\\nFanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The\\nfull list comprises some four hundred and thirty-\\nseven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr.\\nFilch ’s office, if anybody would like to check it.”\\nThe corners of Dumbledore ’s mouth twitched. He\\ncontinued, “As ever, I would like to remind you all\\nthat the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to\\nstudents, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below\\nthird year.\\n“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the\\nInter-House Quidditch Cup will not take place this\\nyear.”\\n \\n“What?” Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and\\nGeorge, his fellow members of the Quidditch team.\\nThey were mouthing soundlessly at Dumbledore,\\napparently too appalled to speak. Dumbledore went\\non, “This is due to an event that will be starting in\\nOctober, and continuing throughout the school year,\\ntaking up much of the teachers’ time and energy —\\nbut I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have\\ngreat pleasure in announcing that this year at\\nHogwarts — ”\\nBut at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of\\nthunder and the doors of the Great Hall banged open.\\nA man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long\\nstaff, shrouded in a black traveling cloak. Every head\\nin the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger,\\nsuddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning\\nthat flashed across the ceiling. He lowered his hood,\\nshook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray hair,\\nthen began to walk up toward the teachers’ table.\\nA dull clunk echoed through the Hall on his every\\nother step. He reached the end of the top table,\\nturned right, and limped heavily toward Dumbledore.\\nAnother flash of lightning crossed the ceiling.\\nHermione gasped.\\nThe lightning had thrown the man’s face into sharp\\nrelief, and it was a face unlike any Harry had ever\\nseen. It looked as though it had been carved out of\\nweathered wood by someone who had only the\\nvaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to\\nlook like, and was none too skilled with a chisel.\\nEvery inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth\\nlooked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the\\nnose was missing. But it was the man’s eyes that\\nmade him frightening.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nOne of them was small, dark, and beady. The other\\nwas large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue.\\nThe blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without\\nblinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to\\nside, quite independently of the normal eye — and\\nthen it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the\\nman’s head, so that all they could see was whiteness.\\nThe stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a\\nhand that was as badly scarred as his face, and\\nDumbledore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn’t\\nhear. He seemed to be making some inquiry of the\\nstranger, who shook his head unsmilingly and replied\\nin an undertone. Dumbledore nodded and gestured\\nthe man to the empty seat on his right-hand side.\\nThe stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray\\nhair out of his face, pulled a plate of sausages toward\\nhim, raised it to what was left of his nose, and sniffed\\nit. He then took a small knife out of his pocket,\\nspeared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat.\\nHis normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the\\nblue eye was still darting restlessly around in its\\nsocket, taking in the Hall and the students.\\n“May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark\\nArts teacher?” said Dumbledore brightly into the\\nsilence. “Professor Moody.”\\nIt was usual for new staff members to be greeted with\\napplause, but none of the staff or students clapped\\nexcept Dumbledore and Hagrid, who both put their\\nhands together and applauded, but the sound echoed\\ndismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly\\nquickly. Everyone else seemed too transfixed by\\nMoody’s bizarre appearance to do more than stare at\\nhim.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Moody?” Harry muttered to Ron. “MacL-Eye Moody?\\nThe one your dad went to help this morning?”\\n“Must be,” said Ron in a low, awed voice.\\n“What happened to him?” Hermione whispered. “What\\nhappened to his face?”\\n“Dunno,” Ron whispered back, watching Moody with\\nfascination.\\nMoody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-\\nwarm welcome. Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in\\nfront of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak,\\npulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from\\nit. As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a\\nfew inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the\\ntable, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a\\nclawed foot.\\nDumbledore cleared his throat.\\n“As I was saying,” he said, smiling at the sea of\\nstudents before him, all of whom were still gazing\\ntransfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, “we are to have the\\nhonor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming\\nmonths, an event that has not been held for over a\\ncentury. It is my very great pleasure to inform you\\nthat the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at\\nHogwarts this year.”\\n“You’re JOKING!” said Fred Weasley loudly.\\nThe tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody’s\\narrival suddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and\\nDumbledore chuckled appreciatively.\\n“I am not joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now\\nthat you mention it, I did hear an excellent one over\\n \\nthe summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun\\nwho all go into a bar ...”\\nProfessor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.\\n“Er — but maybe this is not the time ... no ...” said\\nDumbledore, “where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard\\nTournament ... well, some of you will not know what\\nthis tournament involves, so I hope those who do\\nknow will forgive me for giving a short explanation,\\nand allow their attention to wander freely.\\n“The Triwizard Tournament was first established\\nsome seven hundred years ago as a friendly\\ncompetition between the three largest European\\nschools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and\\nDurmstrang. A champion was selected to represent\\neach school, and the three champions competed in\\nthree magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to\\nhost the tournament once every five years, and it was\\ngenerally agreed to be a most excellent way of\\nestablishing ties between young witches and wizards\\nof different nationalities — until, that is, the death toll\\nmounted so high that the tournament was\\ndiscontinued.”\\n“ Death toll?” Hermione whispered, looking alarmed.\\nBut her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the\\nmajority of students in the Hall; many of them were\\nwhispering excitedly to one another, and Harry\\nhimself was far more interested in hearing about the\\ntournament than in worrying about deaths that had\\nhappened hundreds of years ago.\\n“There have been several attempts over the centuries\\nto reinstate the tournament,” Dumbledore continued,\\n“none of which has been very successful. However,\\nour own departments of International Magical\\nCooperation and Magical Games and Sports have\\n \\ndecided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have\\nworked hard over the summer to ensure that this\\ntime, no champion will find himself or herself in\\nmortal danger.\\n“The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be\\narriving with their short-listed contenders in October,\\nand the selection of the three champions will take\\nplace at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide\\nwhich students are most worthy to compete for the\\nTriwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a\\nthousand Galleons personal prize money.”\\n“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table,\\nhis face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such\\nglory and riches. He was not the only person who\\nseemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts\\nchampion. At every House table, Harry could see\\npeople either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else\\nwhispering fervently to their neighbors. But then\\nDumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once\\nmore.\\n“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the\\nTriwizard Cup to Hogwarts,” he said, “the heads of the\\nparticipating schools, along with the Ministry of\\nMagic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on\\ncontenders this year. Only students who are of age —\\nthat is to say, seventeen years or older — will be\\nallowed to put forward their names for consideration.\\nThis” — Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for\\nseveral people had made noises of outrage at these\\nwords, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking\\nfurious — “is a measure we feel is necessary, given\\nthat the tournament tasks will still be difficult and\\ndangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is\\nhighly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh\\nyear will be able to cope with them. I will personally\\nbe ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our\\n \\nimpartial judge into making them Hogwarts\\nchampion.” His light blue eyes twinkled as they\\nflickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I\\ntherefore beg you not to waste your time submitting\\nyourself if you are under seventeen.\\n“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang\\nwill be arriving in October and remaining with us for\\nthe greater part of this year. I know that you will all\\nextend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they\\nare with us, and will give your whole-hearted support\\nto the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected.\\nAnd now, it is late, and I know how important it is to\\nyou all to be alert and rested as you enter your\\nlessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!”\\nDumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to\\nMad-Eye Moody. There was a great scraping and\\nbanging as all the students got to their feet and\\nswarmed toward the double doors into the entrance\\nhall.\\n“They can’t do that!” said George Weasley, who had\\nnot joined the crowd moving toward the door, but was\\nstanding up and glaring at Dumbledore. “We’re\\nseventeen in April, why can’t we have a shot?”\\n“They’re not stopping me entering,” said Fred\\nstubbornly, also scowling at the top table. “The\\nchampions’ll get to do all sorts of stuff you’d never be\\nallowed to do normally. And a thousand Galleons\\nprize money!”\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, a faraway look on his face. “Yeah, a\\nthousand Galleons ...”\\n“Come on,” said Hermione, “we’ll be the only ones left\\nhere if you don’t move.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for\\nthe entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways\\nin which Dumbledore might stop those who were\\nunder seventeen from entering the tournament.\\n“Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who\\nthe champions are?” said Harry.\\n“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I\\nreckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it,\\nGeorge. ...”\\n“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said\\nRon.\\n“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the\\nchampion is, is he?” said Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to\\nme like once this judge knows who wants to enter,\\nhe’ll choose the best from each school and never mind\\nhow old they are. Dumbledore ’s trying to stop us\\ngiving our names.”\\n“People have died, though!” said Hermione in a\\nworried voice as they walked through a door\\nconcealed behind a tapestry and started up another,\\nnarrower staircase.\\n“Yeah,” said Fred airily, “but that was years ago,\\nwasn’t it? Anyway, where’s the fun without a bit of\\nrisk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get ’round\\nDumbledore? Fancy entering?”\\n“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked Harry. “Be cool to\\nenter, wouldn’t it? But I s’pose they might want\\nsomeone older. ... Dunno if we’ve learned enough. ...”\\n“I definitely haven’t,” came Neville’s gloomy voice from\\nbehind Fred and George.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I expect my gran’d want me to try, though. She’s\\nalways going on about how I should be upholding the\\nfamily honor. I’ll just have to — oops. ...”\\nNeville’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway\\nup the staircase. There were many of these trick\\nstairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of\\nthe older students to jump this particular step, but\\nNeville’s memory was notoriously poor. Harry and\\nRon seized him under the armpits and pulled him\\nout, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs\\ncreaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.\\n“Shut it, you,” said Ron, banging down its visor as\\nthey passed.\\nThey made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor\\nTower, which was concealed behind a large portrait of\\na fat lady in a pink silk dress.\\n“Password?” she said as they approached.\\n“Balderdash,” said George, “a prefect downstairs told\\nme.”\\nThe portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall\\nthrough which they all climbed. A crackling fire\\nwarmed the circular common room, which was full of\\nsquashy armchairs and tables. Hermione cast the\\nmerrily dancing flames a dark look, and Harry\\ndistinctly heard her mutter “ Slave labor,” before\\nbidding them good night and disappearing through\\nthe doorway to the girls’ dormitory.\\nHarry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral\\nstaircase until they reached their own dormitory,\\nwhich was situated at the top of the tower. Five four-\\nposter beds with deep crimson hangings stood against\\nthe walls, each with its owner’s trunk at the foot.\\n \\nDean and Seamus were already getting into bed;\\nSeamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his\\nheadboard, and Dean had tacked up a poster of\\nViktor Krum over his bedside table. His old poster of\\nthe West Ham football team was pinned right next to\\nit.\\n“Mental,” Ron sighed, shaking his head at the\\ncompletely stationary soccer players.\\nHarry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and\\ninto bed. Someone — a house-elf, no doubt — had\\nplaced warming pans between the sheets. It was\\nextremely comfortable, lying there in bed and\\nlistening to the storm raging outside.\\n“I might go in for it, you know,” Ron said sleepily\\nthrough the darkness, “if Fred and George find out\\nhow to ... the tournament ... you never know, do\\nyou?”\\n“S’pose not. ...”\\nHarry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new\\npictures forming in his mind’s eye. ... He had\\nhoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was\\nseventeen ... he had become Hogwarts champion ...\\nhe was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in\\ntriumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were\\napplauding and screaming ... he had just won the\\nTriwizard Tournament. ... Cho’s face stood out\\nparticularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face\\nglowing with admiration. ...\\nHarry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that\\nRon couldn’t see what he could.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nMAD-EYE MOODY\\nThe storm had blown itself out by the following\\nmorning, though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still\\ngloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead\\nas Harry, Ron, and Hermione examined their new\\ncourse schedules at breakfast. A few seats along,\\nFred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing\\nmagical methods of aging themselves and bluffing\\ntheir way into the Triwizard Tournament.\\n“Today’s not bad ... outside all morning,” said Ron,\\nwho was running his finger down the Monday column\\nof his schedule. “Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and\\nCare of Magical Creatures ... damn it, we’re still with\\nthe Slytherins. ...”\\n“Double Divination this afternoon,” Harry groaned,\\nlooking down. Divination was his least favorite\\nsubject, apart from Potions. Professor Trelawney kept\\npredicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely\\nannoying.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You should have given it up like me, shouldn’t you?”\\nsaid Hermione briskly, buttering herself some toast.\\n“Then you’d be doing something sensible like\\nArithmancy.”\\n“You’re eating again, I notice,” said Ron, watching\\nHermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast\\ntoo.\\n“I’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand\\nabout elf rights,” said Hermione haughtily.\\n“Yeah ... and you were hungry,” said Ron, grinning.\\nThere was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a\\nhundred owls came soaring through the open\\nwindows carrying the morning mail. Instinctively,\\nHarry looked up, but there was no sign of white\\namong the mass of brown and gray. The owls circled\\nthe tables, looking for the people to whom their letters\\nand packages were addressed. A large tawny owl\\nsoared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a\\nparcel into his lap — Neville almost always forgot to\\npack something. On the other side of the Hall Draco\\nMalfoy’s eagle owl had landed on his shoulder,\\ncarrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets\\nand cakes from home. Trying to ignore the sinking\\nfeeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry\\nreturned to his porridge. Was it possible that\\nsomething had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius\\nhadn’t even got his letter?\\nHis preoccupation lasted all the way across the\\nsodden vegetable patch until they arrived in\\ngreenhouse three, but here he was distracted by\\nProfessor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants\\nHarry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like\\nplants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding\\nvertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly\\n \\nand had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it,\\nwhich appeared to be full of liquid.\\n“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.\\n“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus — ”\\n“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding\\nrevolted.\\n“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout, “and it’s\\nextremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect\\nthe pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon-\\nhide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when\\nundiluted, bubotuber pus.”\\nSqueezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly\\nsatisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large\\namount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth,\\nwhich smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the\\nbottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the\\nend of the lesson had collected several pints.\\n“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor\\nSprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork. “An\\nexcellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne,\\nbubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to\\ndesperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.”\\n“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a\\nHufflepuff, in a hushed voice. “She tried to curse hers\\noff.”\\n“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head.\\n“But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the\\nend.”\\nA booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet\\ngrounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the\\nclass separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone\\n \\nsteps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading\\nin the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward\\nHagrid ’s small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge\\nof the Forbidden Forest.\\nHagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the\\ncollar of his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There\\nwere several open wooden crates on the ground at his\\nfeet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his\\ncollar, apparently keen to investigate the contents\\nmore closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling\\nnoise reached their ears, punctuated by what\\nsounded like minor explosions.\\n“Mornin’!” Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione. “Be’er wait fer the Slytherins, they won’\\nwant ter miss this — Blast-Ended Skrewts!”\\n“Come again?” said Ron.\\nHagrid pointed down into the crates.\\n“Eurgh!” squealed Lavender Brown, jumping\\nbackward.\\n“Eurgh” just about summed up the Blast-Ended\\nSkrewts in Harry’s opinion. They looked like\\ndeformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy -\\nlooking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and\\nno visible heads. There were about a hundred of them\\nin each crate, each about six inches long, crawling\\nover one another, bumping blindly into the sides of\\nthe boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell\\nof rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly\\nout of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it\\nwould be propelled forward several inches.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“On’y jus’ hatched,” said Hagrid proudly, “so yeh’ll be\\nable ter raise ’em yerselves! Thought we’d make a bit\\nof a project of it!”\\n“And why would we want to raise them?” said a cold\\nvoice.\\nThe Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco\\nMalfoy. Crabbe and Goyle were chuckling\\nappreciatively at his words.\\nHagrid looked stumped at the question.\\n“I mean, what do they do?” asked Malfoy. “What is the\\npoint of them?”\\nHagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard;\\nthere was a few seconds’ pause, then he said roughly,\\n“Tha’s next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus’ feedin’ ’em today.\\nNow, yeh’ll wan’ ter try ’em on a few diff’rent things —\\nI’ve never had ’em before, not sure what they’ll go fer\\n— I got ant eggs an’ frog livers an’ a bit o’ grass snake\\n— just try ’em out with a bit of each.”\\n“First pus and now this,” muttered Seamus.\\nNothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have\\nmade Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy\\nhandfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates\\nto tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn’t\\nsuppress the suspicion that the whole thing was\\nentirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to\\nhave mouths.\\n“Ouch\\\\” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes.\\n“It got me!”\\nHagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid\\na burn on his hand.\\n“Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,” said\\nHagrid, nodding.\\n“Eurgh!” said Lavender Brown again. “Eurgh, Hagrid,\\nwhat’s that pointy thing on it?”\\n“Ah, some of ’em have got stings,” said Hagrid\\nenthusiastically (Lavender quickly withdrew her hand\\nfrom the box). “I reckon they’re the males. ... The\\nfemales Ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies. ... I\\nthink they might be ter suck blood.”\\n“Well, I can certainly see why we’re trying to keep\\nthem alive,” said Malfoy sarcastically. “Who wouldn’t\\nwant pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at once?”\\n“Just because they’re not very pretty, it doesn’t mean\\nthey’re not useful,” Hermione snapped. “Dragon\\nblood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a\\ndragon for a pet, would you?”\\nHarry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a\\nfurtive smile from behind his bushy beard. Hagrid\\nwould have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione knew only too well — he\\nhad owned one for a brief period during their first\\nyear, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of\\nNorbert. Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures,\\nthe more lethal, the better.\\n“Well, at least the skrewts are small,” said Ron as\\nthey made their way back up to the castle for lunch\\nan hour later.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“They are now,” said Hermione in an exasperated\\nvoice, “but once Hagrid’s found out what they eat, I\\nexpect they’ll be six feet long.”\\n“Well, that won’t matter if they turn out to cure\\nseasickness or something, will it?” said Ron, grinning\\nslyly at her.\\n“You know perfectly well I only said that to shut\\nMalfoy up,” said Hermione. “As a matter of fact I\\nthink he’s right. The best thing to do would be to\\nstamp on the lot of them before they start attacking\\nus all.”\\nThey sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped\\nthemselves to lamb chops and potatoes. Hermione\\nbegan to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her.\\n“Er — is this the new stand on elf rights?” said Ron.\\n“You’re going to make yourself puke instead?”\\n“No,” said Hermione, with as much dignity as she\\ncould muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts. “I\\njust want to get to the library.”\\n“What?” said Ron in disbelief. “Hermione — it’s the\\nfirst day back! We haven’t even got homework yet!”\\nHermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her\\nfood as though she had not eaten for days. Then she\\nleapt to her feet, said, “See you at dinner!” and\\ndeparted at high speed.\\nWhen the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon\\nlessons, Harry and Ron set off for North Tower where,\\nat the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver\\nstepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling,\\nand the room where Professor Trelawney lived.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThe familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire\\nmet their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the\\nstepladder. As ever, the curtains were all closed; the\\ncircular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast\\nby the many lamps, which were all draped with\\nscarves and shawls. Harry and Ron walked through\\nthe mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that\\ncluttered the room, and sat down at the same small\\ncircular table.\\n“Good day,” said the misty voice of Professor\\nTrelawney right behind Harry, making him jump.\\nA very thin woman with enormous glasses that made\\nher eyes appear far too large for her face, Professor\\nTrelawney was peering down at Harry with the tragic\\nexpression she always wore whenever she saw him.\\nThe usual large amount of beads, chains, and bangles\\nglittered upon her person in the firelight.\\n“You are preoccupied, my dear,” she said mournfully\\nto Harry. “My inner eye sees past your brave face to\\nthe troubled soul within. And I regret to say that your\\nworries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead\\nfor you, alas ... most difficult ... I fear the thing you\\ndread will indeed come to pass ... and perhaps sooner\\nthan you think. ...”\\nHer voice dropped almost to a whisper. Ron rolled his\\neyes at Harry, who looked stonily back. Professor\\nTrelawney swept past them and seated herself in a\\nlarge winged armchair before the fire, facing the class.\\nLavender Brown and Parvati Patil, who deeply\\nadmired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on poufs\\nvery close to her.\\n“My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,” she\\nsaid. “The movements of the planets and the\\nmysterious portents they reveal only to those who\\n \\nunderstand the steps of the celestial dance. Human\\ndestiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays,\\nwhich intermingle ...”\\nBut Harry’s thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire\\nalways made him feel sleepy and dull-witted, and\\nProfessor Trelawney’s rambling talks on fortune-\\ntelling never held him exactly spellbound — though\\nhe couldn’t help thinking about what she had just\\nsaid to him. “ ‘I fear the thing you dread will indeed\\ncome to pass . . . ’ ”\\nBut Hermione was right, Harry thought irritably,\\nProfessor Trelawney really was an old fraud. He\\nwasn’t dreading anything at the moment at all ... well,\\nunless you counted his fears that Sirius had been\\ncaught ... but what did Professor Trelawney know? He\\nhad long since come to the conclusion that her brand\\nof fortune-telling was really no more than lucky\\nguesswork and a spooky manner.\\nExcept, of course, for that time at the end of last\\nterm, when she had made the prediction about\\nVoldemort rising again . . . and Dumbledore himself\\nhad said that he thought that trance had been\\ngenuine, when Harry had described it to him. ...\\n“Harry\\\\” Ron muttered.\\n“What?”\\nHarry looked around; the whole class was staring at\\nhim. He sat up straight; he had been almost dozing\\noff, lost in the heat and his thoughts.\\n“I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born\\nunder the baleful influence of Saturn,” said Professor\\nTrelawney, a faint note of resentment in her voice at\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nthe fact that he had obviously not been hanging on\\nher words.\\n“Born under — what, sorry?” said Harry.\\n“Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!” said Professor\\nTrelawney, sounding definitely irritated that he wasn’t\\nriveted by this news. “I was saying that Saturn was\\nsurely in a position of power in the heavens at the\\nmoment of your birth. ... Your dark hair ... your mean\\nstature ... tragic losses so young in life ... I think I am\\nright in saying, my dear, that you were born in\\nmidwinter?”\\n“No,” said Harry, “I was born in July.”\\nRon hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.\\nHalf an hour later, each of them had been given a\\ncomplicated circular chart, and was attempting to fill\\nin the position of the planets at their moment of birth.\\nIt was dull work, requiring much consultation of\\ntimetables and calculation of angles.\\n“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said Harry after a while,\\nfrowning down at his piece of parchment, “that can’t\\nbe right, can it?”\\n“Aaaaah,” said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney’s\\nmystical whisper, “when two Neptunes appear in the\\nsky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being\\nborn, Harry ...”\\nSeamus and Dean, who were working nearby,\\nsniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask\\nthe excited squeals from Lavender Brown — “Oh\\nProfessor, look! I think I’ve got an unaspected planet!\\nOooh, which one’s that, Professor?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“It is Uranus, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney,\\npeering down at the chart.\\n“Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?” said\\nRon.\\nMost unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him,\\nand it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so\\nmuch homework at the end of the class.\\n“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary\\nmovements in the coming month will affect you, with\\nreference to your personal chart,” she snapped,\\nsounding much more like Professor McGonagall than\\nher usual airy-fairy self. “I want it ready to hand in\\nnext Monday, and no excuses!”\\n“Miserable old bat,” said Ron bitterly as they joined\\nthe crowds descending the staircases back to the\\nGreat Hall and dinner. “Thatll take all weekend, that\\nwill. ...”\\n“Lots of homework?” said Hermione brightly, catching\\nup with them. “Professor Vector didn’t give us any at\\nall!”\\n“Well, bully for Professor Vector,” said Ron moodily.\\nThey reached the entrance hall, which was packed\\nwith people queuing for dinner. They had just joined\\nthe end of the line, when a loud voice rang out behind\\nthem.\\n“Weasley! Hey, Weasley!”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned. Malfoy, Crabbe,\\nand Goyle were standing there, each looking\\nthoroughly pleased about something.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“What?” said Ron shortly.\\n“Your dad’s in the paper, Weasley!” said Malfoy,\\nbrandishing a copy of the Daily Prophet and speaking\\nvery loudly, so that everyone in the packed entrance\\nhall could hear. “Listen to this!\\nFURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\\nIt seems as though the Ministry of Magic’s troubles are\\nnot yet at an end, writes Rita Skeeter, Special\\nCorrespondent. Recently under fire for its poor crowd\\ncontrol at the Quidditch World Cup, and still unable to\\naccount for the disappearance of one of its witches, the\\nMinistry was plunged into fresh embarrassment\\nyesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley, of the\\nMisuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. ”\\nMalfoy looked up.\\n“Imagine them not even getting his name right,\\nWeasley. It’s almost as though he’s a complete\\nnonentity, isn’t it?” he crowed.\\nEveryone in the entrance hall was listening now.\\nMalfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and\\nread on:\\nArnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of\\na flying car two years ago, was yesterday involved in\\na tussle with several Muggle law-keepers (“policemen”)\\nover a number of highly aggressive dustbins. Mr.\\nWeasley appears to have rushed to the aid of “Mad-\\nEye” Moody, the aged ex-Auror who retired from the\\nMinistry when no longer able to tell the difference\\nbetween a handshake and attempted murder.\\nUnsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley found, upon arrival at Mr.\\nMoody ’s heavily guarded house, that Mr. Moody had\\nonce again raised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley was\\n \\nforced to modify several memories before he could\\nescape from the policemen, but refused to answer\\nDaily Prophet questions about why he had involved\\nthe Ministry in such an undignified and potentially\\nembarrassing scene.\\n“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Malfoy, flipping\\nthe paper over and holding it up. “A picture of your\\nparents outside their house — if you can call it a\\nhouse! Your mother could do with losing a bit of\\nweight, couldn’t she?”\\nRon was shaking with fury. Everyone was staring at\\nhim.\\n“Get stuffed, Malfoy,” said Harry. “C’mon, Ron. ...”\\n“Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer,\\nweren’t you, Potter?” sneered Malfoy. “So tell me, is\\nhis mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?”\\n“You know your mother, Malfoy?” said Harry — both\\nhe and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron’s\\nrobes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy —\\n“that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under\\nher nose? Has she always looked like that, or was it\\njust because you were with her?”\\nMalfoy’s pale face went slightly pink.\\n“Don’t you dare insult my mother, Potter.”\\n“Keep your fat mouth shut, then,” said Harry, turning\\naway.\\nBANG!\\nSeveral people screamed — Harry felt something\\nwhite-hot graze the side of his face — he plunged his\\n \\nhand into his robes for his wand, but before he’d even\\ntouched it, he heard a second loud BANG, and a roar\\nthat echoed through the entrance hall.\\n“OH NO YOU DONT, LADDIE!”\\nHarry spun around. Professor Moody was limping\\ndown the marble staircase. His wand was out and it\\nwas pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was\\nshivering on the stone-flagged floor, exactly where\\nMalfoy had been standing.\\nThere was a terrified silence in the entrance hall.\\nNobody but Moody was moving a muscle. Moody\\nturned to look at Harry — at least, his normal eye was\\nlooking at Harry; the other one was pointing into the\\nback of his head.\\n“Did he get you?” Moody growled. His voice was low\\nand gravelly.\\n“No,” said Harry, “missed.”\\n“LEAVE IT!” Moody shouted.\\n“Leave — what?” Harry said, bewildered.\\n“Not you — him!” Moody growled, jerking his thumb\\nover his shoulder at Crabbe, who had just frozen,\\nabout to pick up the white ferret. It seemed that\\nMoody’s rolling eye was magical and could see out of\\nthe back of his head.\\nMoody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the\\nferret, which gave a terrified squeak and took off,\\nstreaking toward the dungeons.\\n“I don’t think so!” roared Moody, pointing his wand at\\nthe ferret again — it flew ten feet into the air, fell with\\n \\na smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once\\nmore.\\n“I don’t like people who attack when their opponent’s\\nback’s turned,” growled Moody as the ferret bounced\\nhigher and higher, squealing in pain. “Stinking,\\ncowardly, scummy thing to do. ...”\\nThe ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing\\nhelplessly.\\n“Never — do — that — again — ” said Moody, speaking\\neach word as the ferret hit the stone floor and\\nbounced upward again.\\n“Professor Moody!” said a shocked voice.\\nProfessor McGonagall was coming down the marble\\nstaircase with her arms full of books.\\n“Hello, Professor McGonagall,” said Moody calmly,\\nbouncing the ferret still higher.\\n“What — what are you doing?” said Professor\\nMcGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret’s\\nprogress through the air.\\n“Teaching,” said Moody.\\n“Teach — Moody, is that a student?” shrieked\\nProfessor McGonagall, the books spilling out of her\\narms.\\n“Yep,” said Moody.\\n“No!” cried Professor McGonagall, running down the\\nstairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with\\na loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared,\\nlying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair\\n \\nall over his now brilliantly pink face. He got to his\\nfeet, wincing.\\n“Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a\\npunishment!” said Professor McGonagall weakly.\\n“Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?”\\n“He might’ve mentioned it, yeah,” said Moody,\\nscratching his chin unconcernedly, “but I thought a\\ngood sharp shock — ”\\n“We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender’s\\nHead of House!”\\n“I’ll do that, then,” said Moody, staring at Malfoy with\\ngreat dislike.\\nMalfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain\\nand humiliation, looked malevolently up at Moody\\nand muttered something in which the words “my\\nfather” were distinguishable.\\n“Oh yeah?” said Moody quietly, limping forward a few\\nsteps, the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around\\nthe hall. “Well, I know your father of old, boy. ... You\\ntell him Moody’s keeping a close eye on his son . . . you\\ntell him that from me. ... Now, your Head of House’ll\\nbe Snape, will it?”\\n“Yes,” said Malfoy resentfully.\\n“Another old friend,” growled Moody. “I’ve been\\nlooking forward to a chat with old Snape. ... Come on,\\nyou. ...”\\nAnd he seized Malfoy’s upper arm and marched him\\noff toward the dungeons.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nProfessor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for\\na few moments, then waved her wand at her fallen\\nbooks, causing them to soar up into the air and back\\ninto her arms.\\n“Don’t talk to me,” Ron said quietly to Harry and\\nHermione as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a\\nfew minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all\\nsides about what had just happened.\\n“Why not?” said Hermione in surprise.\\n“Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,”\\nsaid Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression\\non his face. “Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing\\nferret ...”\\nHarry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione\\nbegan doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.\\n“He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,” she said.\\n“It was good, really, that Professor McGonagall\\nstopped it — ”\\n“Hermione!” said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping\\nopen again, “you’re ruining the best moment of my\\nlife!”\\nHermione made an impatient noise and began to eat\\nat top speed again.\\n“Don’t tell me you’re going back to the library this\\nevening?” said Harry, watching her.\\n“Got to,” said Hermione thickly. “Loads to do.”\\n“But you told us Professor Vector — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“It’s not schoolwork,” she said. Within five minutes,\\nshe had cleared her plate and departed. No sooner\\nhad she gone than her seat was taken by Fred\\nWeasley.\\n“Moody!” he said. “How cool is he?”\\n“Beyond cool,” said George, sitting down opposite\\nFred.\\n“Supercool,” said the twins’ best friend, Lee Jordan,\\nsliding into the seat beside George. “We had him this\\nafternoon,” he told Harry and Ron.\\n“What was it like?” said Harry eagerly.\\nFred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of\\nmeaning.\\n“Never had a lesson like it,” said Fred.\\n“He knows, man,” said Lee.\\n“Knows what?” said Ron, leaning forward.\\n“Knows what it’s like to be out there doing it,” said\\nGeorge impressively.\\n“Doing what?” said Harry.\\n“Fighting the Dark Arts,” said Fred.\\n“He’s seen it all,” said George.\\n“ ’Mazing,” said Lee.\\nRon dived into his bag for his schedule.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“We haven’t got him till Thursday!” he said in a\\ndisappointed voice.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES\\nThe next two days passed without great incident,\\nunless you counted Neville melting his sixth cauldron\\nin Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have\\nattained new levels of vindictiveness over the\\nsummer, gave Neville detention, and Neville returned\\nfrom it in a state of nervous collapse, having been\\nmade to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.\\n“You know why Snape ’s in such a foul mood, don’t\\nyou?” said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione\\nteaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog\\nguts from under his fingernails.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “Moody.”\\nIt was common knowledge that Snape really wanted\\nthe Dark Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for\\nthe fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of\\ntheir previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it —\\nbut he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt\\nanimosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry\\nsaw the two of them together — at mealtimes, or\\n \\nwhen they passed in the corridors — he had the\\ndistinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody’s\\neye, whether magical or normal.\\n“I reckon Snape’s a bit scared of him, you know,”\\nHarry said thoughtfully.\\n“Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,”\\nsaid Ron, his eyes misting over, “and bounced him all\\naround his dungeon. ...”\\nThe Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to\\nMoody’s first lesson so much that they arrived early\\non Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his\\nclassroom before the bell had even rung. The only\\nperson missing was Hermione, who turned up just in\\ntime for the lesson.\\n“Been in the — ”\\n“Library.” Harry finished her sentence for her.\\n“C’mon, quick, or we won’t get decent seats.”\\nThey hurried into three chairs right in front of the\\nteacher’s desk, took out their copies of The Dark\\nForces: A Guide to Self-Protection, and waited,\\nunusually quiet. Soon they heard Moody’s distinctive\\nclunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he\\nentered the room, looking as strange and frightening\\nas ever. They could just see his clawed, wooden foot\\nprotruding from underneath his robes.\\n“You can put those away,” he growled, stumping over\\nto his desk and sitting down, “those books. You won’t\\nneed them.”\\nThey returned the books to their bags, Ron looking\\nexcited.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nMoody took out a register, shook his long mane of\\ngrizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face,\\nand began to call out names, his normal eye moving\\nsteadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled\\naround, fixing upon each student as he or she\\nanswered.\\n“Right then,” he said, when the last person had\\ndeclared themselves present, “I’ve had a letter from\\nProfessor Lupin about this class. Seems you’ve had a\\npretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures\\n— you’ve covered boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks,\\ngrindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that right?”\\nThere was a general murmur of assent.\\n“But you’re behind — very behind — on dealing with\\ncurses,” said Moody. “So I’m here to bring you up to\\nscratch on what wizards can do to each other. I’ve got\\none year to teach you how to deal with Dark — ”\\n“What, aren’t you staying?” Ron blurted out.\\nMoody’s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron;\\nRon looked extremely apprehensive, but after a\\nmoment Moody smiled — the first time Harry had\\nseen him do so. The effect was to make his heavily\\nscarred face look more twisted and contorted than\\never, but it was nevertheless good to know that he\\never did anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked\\ndeeply relieved.\\n“You’ll be Arthur Weasley’s son, eh?” Moody said.\\n“Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few\\ndays ago. ... Yeah, I’m staying just the one year.\\nSpecial favor to Dumbledore. ... One year, and then\\nback to my quiet retirement.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHe gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled\\nhands together.\\n“So — straight into it. Curses. They come in many\\nstrengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry\\nof Magic, I’m supposed to teach you countercurses\\nand leave it at that. I’m not supposed to show you\\nwhat illegal Dark curses look like until you’re in the\\nsixth year. You’re not supposed to be old enough to\\ndeal with it till then. But Professor Dumbledore’s got\\na higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can\\ncope, and I say, the sooner you know what you’re up\\nagainst, the better. How are you supposed to defend\\nyourself against something you’ve never seen? A\\nwizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t\\ngoing to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going\\nto do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be\\nprepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You\\nneed to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m\\ntalking.”\\nLavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing\\nParvati her completed horoscope under the desk.\\nApparently Moody’s magical eye could see through\\nsolid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.\\n“So ... do any of you know which curses are most\\nheavily punished by wizarding law?”\\nSeveral hands rose tentatively into the air, including\\nRon’s and Hermione’s. Moody pointed at Ron, though\\nhis magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.\\n“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one.\\n... Is it called the Imperius Curse, or something?”\\n“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father\\nwould know that one. Gave the Ministry a lot of\\ntrouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”\\n \\nMoody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his\\ndesk drawer, and took out a glass jar. Three large\\nblack spiders were scuttling around inside it. Harry\\nfelt Ron recoil slightly next to him — Ron hated\\nspiders.\\nMoody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders,\\nand held it in the palm of his hand so that they could\\nall see it. He then pointed his wand at it and\\nmuttered, “Imperio\\\\”\\nThe spider leapt from Moody’s hand on a fine thread\\nof silk and began to swing backward and forward as\\nthough on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs rigidly,\\nthen did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing\\non the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles.\\nMoody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two\\nof its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably\\na tap dance.\\nEveryone was laughing — everyone except Moody.\\n“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it,\\nwould you, if I did it to you?”\\nThe laughter died away almost instantly.\\n“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider\\nballed itself up and began to roll over and over. “I\\ncould make it jump out of the window, drown itself,\\nthrow itself down one of your throats ...”\\nRon gave an involuntary shudder.\\n“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards\\nbeing controlled by the Imperius Curse,” said Moody,\\nand Harry knew he was talking about the days in\\nwhich Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nthe Ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced\\nto act, and who was acting of their own free will.\\n“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be\\nteaching you how, but it takes real strength of\\ncharacter, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid\\nbeing hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!”\\nhe barked, and everyone jumped.\\nMoody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw\\nit back into the jar.\\n“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”\\nHermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to\\nHarry’s slight surprise, did Neville’s. The only class in\\nwhich Neville usually volunteered information was\\nHerbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville\\nlooked surprised at his own daring.\\n“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over\\nto fix on Neville.\\n“There’s one — the Cruciatus Curse,” said Neville in a\\nsmall but distinct voice.\\nMoody was looking very intently at Neville, this time\\nwith both eyes.\\n“Your name’s Longbottom?” he said, his magical eye\\nswooping down to check the register again.\\nNeville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further\\ninquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he\\nreached into the jar for the next spider and placed it\\nupon the desktop, where it remained motionless,\\napparently too scared to move.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody. “Needs to be a bit\\nbigger for you to get the idea,” he said, pointing his\\nwand at the spider. “Engorgio\\\\”\\nThe spider swelled. It was now larger than a\\ntarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his\\nchair backward, as far away from Moody’s desk as\\npossible.\\nMoody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider,\\nand muttered, “CrucioV’\\nAt once, the spider’s legs bent in upon its body; it\\nrolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from\\nside to side. No sound came from it, but Harry was\\nsure that if it could have given voice, it would have\\nbeen screaming. Moody did not remove his wand, and\\nthe spider started to shudder and jerk more violently\\n“Stop it!” Hermione said shrilly.\\nHarry looked around at her. She was looking, not at\\nthe spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her\\ngaze, saw that Neville’s hands were clenched upon the\\ndesk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes\\nwide and horrified.\\nMoody raised his wand. The spider’s legs relaxed, but\\nit continued to twitch.\\n“Reducio,” Moody muttered, and the spider shrank\\nback to its proper size. He put it back into the jar.\\n“Pain,” said Moody softly. “You don’t need\\nthumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can\\nperform the Cruciatus Curse. ... That one was very\\npopular once too.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Right . . . anyone know any others?”\\nHarry looked around. From the looks on everyone’s\\nfaces, he guessed they were all wondering what was\\ngoing to happen to the last spider. Hermione’s hand\\nshook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into\\nthe air.\\n“Yes?” said Moody, looking at her.\\n“Avada Kedavra,” Hermione whispered.\\nSeveral people looked uneasily around at her,\\nincluding Ron.\\n“Ah,” said Moody, another slight smile twisting his\\nlopsided mouth. “Yes, the last and worst. Avada\\nKedavra ... the Killing Curse.”\\nHe put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as\\nthough it knew what was coming, the third spider\\nscuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar,\\ntrying to evade Moody’s fingers, but he trapped it, and\\nplaced it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle\\nfrantically across the wooden surface.\\nMoody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill\\nof foreboding.\\n“Avada Kedavral” Moody roared.\\nThere was a flash of blinding green light and a\\nrushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something\\nwas soaring through the air — instantaneously the\\nspider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but\\nunmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled\\ncries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost\\ntoppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.\\n \\nMoody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the\\nfloor.\\n“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s\\nno countercurse. There’s no blocking it. Only one\\nknown person has ever survived it, and he’s sitting\\nright in front of me.”\\nHarry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of\\nthem) looked into his own. He could feel everyone else\\nlooking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank\\nblackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really\\nseeing it at all. ...\\nSo that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like\\nthat spider. Had they been unblemished and\\nunmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of\\ngreen light and heard the rush of speeding death,\\nbefore life was wiped from their bodies?\\nHarry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over\\nand over again for three years now, ever since he’d\\nfound out they had been murdered, ever since he’d\\nfound out what had happened that night: Wormtail\\nhad betrayed his parents’ whereabouts to Voldemort,\\nwho had come to find them at their cottage. How\\nVoldemort had killed Harry’s father first. How James\\nPotter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at\\nhis wife to take Harry and run ... Voldemort had\\nadvanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so\\nthat he could kill Harry . . . how she had begged him to\\nkill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son . . .\\nand so Voldemort had murdered her too, before\\nturning his wand on Harry. . . .\\nHarry knew these details because he had heard his\\nparents’ voices when he had fought the dementors\\nlast year — for that was the terrible power of the\\ndementors: to force their victims to relive the worst\\n \\nmemories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their\\nown despair. . . .\\nMoody was speaking again, from a great distance, it\\nseemed to Harry. With a massive effort, he pulled\\nhimself back to the present and listened to what\\nMoody was saying.\\n“Avada Kedavra’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of\\nmagic behind it — you could all get your wands out\\nnow and point them at me and say the words, and I\\ndoubt I’d get so much as a nosebleed. But that\\ndoesn’t matter. I’m not here to teach you how to do it.\\n“Now, if there’s no countercurse, why am I showing\\nyou? Because you’ve got to know. You’ve got to\\nappreciate what the worst is. You don’t want to find\\nyourself in a situation where you’re facing it.\\nCONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he roared, and the whole\\nclass jumped again.\\n“Now ... those three curses — Avada Kedavra,\\nImperius, and Cruciatus — are known as the\\nUnforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a\\nfellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence\\nin Azkaban. That’s what you’re up against. That’s\\nwhat I’ve got to teach you to fight. You need\\npreparing. You need arming. But most of all, you\\nneed to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get\\nout your quills ... copy this down. ...”\\nThey spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each\\nof the Unforgivable Curses. No one spoke until the\\nbell rang — but when Moody had dismissed them and\\nthey had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst\\nforth. Most people were discussing the curses in awed\\nvoices — “Did you see it twitch?” “ — and when he\\nkilled it — just like that!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThey were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as\\nthough it had been some sort of spectacular show,\\nbut he hadn’t found it very entertaining — and nor, it\\nseemed, had Hermione.\\n“Hurry up,” she said tensely to Harry and Ron.\\n“Not the ruddy library again?” said Ron.\\n“No,” said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side\\npassage. “Neville.”\\nNeville was standing alone, halfway up the passage,\\nstaring at the stone wall opposite him with the same\\nhorrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody\\nhad demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.\\n“Neville?” Hermione said gently.\\nNeville looked around.\\n“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual.\\n“Interesting lesson, wasn’t it? I wonder what’s for\\ndinner, I’m — I’m starving, aren’t you?”\\n“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.\\n“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same\\nunnaturally high voice. “Very interesting dinner — I\\nmean lesson — what’s for eating?”\\nRon gave Harry a startled look.\\n“Neville, what — ?”\\nBut an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and\\nthey turned to see Professor Moody limping toward\\nthem. All four of them fell silent, watching him\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\napprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much\\nlower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.\\n“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville. “Why don’t\\nyou come up to my office? Come on . . . we can have a\\ncup of tea. ...”\\nNeville looked even more frightened at the prospect of\\ntea with Moody. He neither moved nor spoke. Moody\\nturned his magical eye upon Harry.\\n“You all right, are you, Potter?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry, almost defiantly.\\nMoody’s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it\\nsurveyed Harry. Then he said, “You’ve got to know. It\\nseems harsh, maybe, but you’ve got to know. No point\\npretending ... well ... come on, Longbottom, I’ve got\\nsome books that might interest you.”\\nNeville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione, but they didn’t say anything, so Neville\\nhad no choice but to allow himself to be steered away,\\none of Moody’s gnarled hands on his shoulder.\\n“What was that about?” said Ron, watching Neville\\nand Moody turn the corner.\\n“I don’t know,” said Hermione, looking pensive.\\n“Some lesson, though, eh?” said Ron to Harry as they\\nset off for the Great Hall. “Fred and George were right,\\nweren’t they? He really knows his stuff, Moody,\\ndoesn’t he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that\\nspider just died, just snuffed it right — ”\\nBut Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry’s\\nface and didn’t speak again until they reached the\\n \\nGreat Hall, when he said he supposed they had better\\nmake a start on Professor Trelawney’s predictions\\ntonight, since they would take hours.\\nHermione did not join in with Harry and Ron’s\\nconversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast,\\nand then left for the library again. Harry and Ron\\nwalked back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had\\nbeen thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now\\nraised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.\\n“Wouldn’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with\\nthe Ministry if they knew we’d seen the curses?”\\nHarry asked as they approached the Fat Lady.\\n“Yeah, probably,” said Ron. “But Dumbledore’s always\\ndone things his way, hasn’t he, and Moody’s been\\ngetting in trouble for years, I reckon. Attacks first and\\nasks questions later — look at his dustbins.\\nBalderdash.”\\nThe Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance\\nhole, and they climbed into the Gryffindor common\\nroom, which was crowded and noisy.\\n“Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?” said Harry.\\n“I s’pose,” Ron groaned.\\nThey went up to the dormitory to fetch their books\\nand charts, to find Neville there alone, sitting on his\\nbed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at\\nthe end of Moody’s lesson, though still not entirely\\nnormal. His eyes were rather red.\\n“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.\\n“Oh yes,” said Neville, “I’m fine, thanks. Just reading\\nthis book Professor Moody lent me. ...”\\n \\nHe held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the\\nMediterranean.\\n“Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody\\nI’m really good at Herbology,” Neville said. There was\\na faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely\\nheard there before. “He thought I’d like this.”\\nTelling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry\\nthought, had been a very tactful way of cheering\\nNeville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was\\ngood at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor\\nLupin would have done.\\nHarry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the\\nFuture back down to the common room, found a\\ntable, and set to work on their predictions for the\\ncoming month. An hour later, they had made very\\nlittle progress, though their table was littered with\\nbits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and\\nHarry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been\\nfilled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire.\\n“I haven’t got a clue what this lot’s supposed to\\nmean,” he said, staring down at a long list of\\ncalculations.\\n“You know,” said Ron, whose hair was on end\\nbecause of all the times he had run his fingers\\nthrough it in frustration, “I think it’s back to the old\\nDivination standby.”\\n“What — make it up?”\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled\\nnotes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and\\nstarting to write.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Next Monday,” he said as he scribbled, “I am likely to\\ndevelop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of\\nMars and Jupiter.” He looked up at Harry. “You know\\nher — just put in loads of misery, shell lap it up.”\\n“Right,” said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt\\nand lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering\\nfirst years into the fire. “Okay ... on Monday, / will be\\nin danger of — er — burns.”\\n“Yeah, you will be,” said Ron darkly, “we’re seeing the\\nskrewts again on Monday. Okay, Tuesday, I’ll ... erm\\n“Lose a treasured possession,” said Harry, who was\\nflicking through Unfogging the Future for ideas.\\n“Good one,” said Ron, copying it down. “Because of\\n... erm ... Mercury. Why don’t you get stabbed in the\\nback by someone you thought was a friend?”\\n“Yeah ... cool ...” said Harry, scribbling it down,\\n“because ... Venus is in the twelfth house.”\\n“And on Wednesday, I think I’ll come off worst in a\\nfight.”\\n“Aaah, I was going to have a fight. Okay, I’ll lose a\\nbet.”\\n“Yeah, you’ll be betting I’ll win my fight. ...”\\nThey continued to make up predictions (which grew\\nsteadily more tragic) for another hour, while the\\ncommon room around them slowly emptied as people\\nwent up to bed. Crookshanks wandered over to them,\\nleapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared\\ninscrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might look if\\nshe knew they weren’t doing their homework properly.\\n \\nStaring around the room, trying to think of a kind of\\nmisfortune he hadn’t yet used, Harry saw Fred and\\nGeorge sitting together against the opposite wall,\\nheads together, quills out, poring over a single piece\\nof parchment. It was most unusual to see Fred and\\nGeorge hidden away in a corner and working silently;\\nthey usually liked to be in the thick of things and the\\nnoisy center of attention. There was something\\nsecretive about the way they were working on the\\npiece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how\\nthey had sat together writing something back at the\\nBurrow. He had thought then that it was another\\norder form for Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, but it didn’t\\nlook like that this time; if it had been, they would\\nsurely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He\\nwondered whether it had anything to do with entering\\nthe Triwizard Tournament.\\nAs Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred,\\nscratched out something with his quill, and said, in a\\nvery quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the\\nalmost deserted room, “No — that sounds like we’re\\naccusing him. Got to be careful ...”\\nThen George looked over and saw Harry watching\\nhim. Harry grinned and quickly returned to his\\npredictions — he didn’t want George to think he was\\neavesdropping. Shortly after that, the twins rolled up\\ntheir parchment, said good night, and went off to bed.\\nFred and George had been gone ten minutes or so\\nwhen the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed\\ninto the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment\\nin one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she\\nwalked in the other. Crookshanks arched his back,\\npurring.\\n“Hello,” she said, “I’ve just finished!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“So have I!” said Ron triumphantly, throwing down\\nhis quill.\\nHermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying\\nin an empty armchair, and pulled Ron’s predictions\\ntoward her.\\n“Not going to have a very good month, are you?” she\\nsaid sardonically as Crookshanks curled up in her\\nlap.\\n“Ah well, at least I’m forewarned,” Ron yawned.\\n“You seem to be drowning twice,” said Hermione.\\n“Oh am I?” said Ron, peering down at his predictions.\\n“I’d better change one of them to getting trampled by\\na rampaging hippogriff.”\\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit obvious you’ve made these\\nup?” said Hermione.\\n“How dare you!” said Ron, in mock outrage. “We’ve\\nbeen working like house-elves here!”\\nHermione raised her eyebrows.\\n“It’s just an expression,” said Ron hastily.\\nHarry laid down his quill too, having just finished\\npredicting his own death by decapitation.\\n“What’s in the box?” he asked, pointing at it.\\n“Funny you should ask,” said Hermione, with a nasty\\nlook at Ron. She took off the lid and showed them the\\ncontents.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nInside were about fifty badges, all of different colors,\\nbut all bearing the same letters: S.P.E.W.\\n“ ‘Spew?” said Harry, picking up a badge and looking\\nat it. “What’s this about?”\\n“Not spew,” said Hermione impatiently. “It’s S-P-E-W.\\nStands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish\\nWelfare.”\\n“Never heard of it,” said Ron.\\n“Well, of course you haven’t,” said Hermione briskly,\\n“I’ve only just started it.”\\n“Yeah?” said Ron in mild surprise. “How many\\nmembers have you got?”\\n“Well — if you two join — three,” said Hermione.\\n“And you think we want to walk around wearing\\nbadges saying ‘spew,’ do you?” said Ron.\\n“S-P-E-W!” said Hermione hotly. “I was going to put\\nStop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical\\nCreatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal\\nStatus — but it wouldn’t fit. So that’s the heading of\\nour manifesto.”\\nShe brandished the sheaf of parchment at them.\\n“I’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf\\nenslavement goes back centuries. I can’t believe no\\none’s done anything about it before now.”\\n“Hermione — open your ears,” said Ron loudly. “They.\\nLike. It. They like being enslaved!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even\\nmore loudly than Ron, and acting as though she\\nhadn’t heard a word, “are to secure house-elves fair\\nwages and working conditions. Our long-term aims\\ninclude changing the law about non-wand use, and\\ntrying to get an elf into the Department for the\\nRegulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because\\nthey’re shockingly underrepresented.”\\n“And how do we do all this?” Harry asked.\\n“We start by recruiting members,” said Hermione\\nhappily. “I thought two Sickles to join — that buys a\\nbadge — and the proceeds can fund our leaflet\\ncampaign. You’re treasurer, Ron — I’ve got you a\\ncollecting tin upstairs — and Harry, you’re secretary,\\nso you might want to write down everything I’m\\nsaying now, as a record of our first meeting.”\\nThere was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the\\npair of them, and Harry sat, torn between\\nexasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look\\non Ron’s face. The silence was broken, not by Ron,\\nwho in any case looked as though he was temporarily\\ndumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window.\\nHarry looked across the now empty common room\\nand saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl\\nperched on the windowsill.\\n“Hedwig!” he shouted, and he launched himself out of\\nhis chair and across the room to pull open the\\nwindow.\\nHedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and\\nlanded on the table on top of Harry’s predictions.\\n“About time!” said Harry, hurrying after her.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“She’s got an answer!” said Ron excitedly, pointing at\\nthe grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig’s leg.\\nHarry hastily untied it and sat down to read,\\nwhereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting\\nsoftly.\\n“What does it say?” Hermione asked breathlessly.\\nThe letter was very short, and looked as though it had\\nbeen scrawled in a great hurry. Harry read it aloud:\\nHarry —\\nI’m flying north immediately. This news about your\\nscar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that\\nhave reached me here. If it hurts again , go straight to\\nDumbledore — they’re saying he’s got Mad-Eye out of\\nretirement, which means he’s reading the signs, even if\\nno one else is.\\nI’ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione.\\nKeep your eyes open, Harry.\\nSirius\\nHarry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared\\nback at him.\\n“He’s flying north?” Hermione whispered. “He’s\\ncoming back?”\\n“Dumbledore’s reading what signs?” said Ron, looking\\nperplexed. “Harry — what’s up?”\\nFor Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with\\nhis fist, jolting Hedwig out of his lap.\\n“I shouldn’t’ve told him!” Harry said furiously.\\n \\n“What are you on about?” said Ron in surprise.\\n“It’s made him think he’s got to come back!” said\\nHarry, now slamming his fist on the table so that\\nHedwig landed on the back of Ron’s chair, hooting\\nindignantly. “Coming back, because he thinks I’m in\\ntrouble! And there’s nothing wrong with me! And I\\nhaven’t got anything for you,” Harry snapped at\\nHedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly,\\n“you’ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food.”\\nHedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took\\noff for the open window, cuffing him around the head\\nwith her outstretched wing as she went.\\n“Harry,” Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.\\n“I’m going to bed,” said Harry shortly. “See you in the\\nmorning.”\\nUpstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas\\nand got into his four-poster, but he didn’t feel\\nremotely tired.\\nIf Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his,\\nHarry’s, fault. Why hadn’t he kept his mouth shut? A\\nfew seconds’ pain and he’d had to blab. ... If he’d just\\nhad the sense to keep it to himself. . . .\\nHe heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short\\nwhile later, but did not speak to him. For a long time,\\nHarry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed.\\nThe dormitory was completely silent, and, had he\\nbeen less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that\\nthe absence of Neville’s usual snores meant that he\\nwas not the only one lying awake.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBEAUXBATONS AND DRUMSTRANG\\nEarly next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully\\nformed in his mind, as though his sleeping brain had\\nbeen working on it all night. He got up, dressed in the\\npale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking\\nRon, and went back down to the deserted common\\nroom. Here he took a piece of parchment from the\\ntable upon which his Divination homework still lay\\nand wrote the following letter:\\nDear Sirius,\\nI reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half\\nasleep when I wrote to you last time. There’s no point\\ncoming back, everything’s fine here. Don’t worry about\\nme, my head feels completely normal.\\nHarry\\nHe then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through\\nthe silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who\\ntried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nthe fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the\\nOwlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower.\\nThe Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold\\nand drafty, because none of the windows had glass in\\nthem. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl\\ndroppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and\\nvoles. Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every\\nbreed imaginable were nestled here on perches that\\nrose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of\\nthem asleep, though here and there a round amber\\neye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled\\nbetween a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to\\nher, sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor.\\nIt took him a while to persuade her to wake up and\\nthen to look at him, as she kept shuffling around on\\nher perch, showing him her tail. She was evidently\\nstill furious about his lack of gratitude the previous\\nnight. In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might\\nbe too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to\\nborrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg\\nand allow him to tie the letter to it.\\n“Just find him, all right?” Harry said, stroking her\\nback as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes\\nin the wall. “Before the dementors do.”\\nShe nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she\\nwould ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a\\nreassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread\\nher wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry\\nwatched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of\\nunease back in his stomach. He had been so sure\\nthat Sirius’s reply would alleviate his worries rather\\nthan increasing them.\\n“That was a lie, Harry,” said Hermione sharply over\\nbreakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had\\n \\ndone. “You didn’t imagine your scar hurting and you\\nknow it.”\\n“So what?” said Harry. “He’s not going back to\\nAzkaban because of me.”\\n“Drop it,” said Ron sharply to Hermione as she\\nopened her mouth to argue some more, and for once,\\nHermione heeded him, and fell silent.\\nHarry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the\\nnext couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself\\nfrom looking anxiously around every morning when\\nthe post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went\\nto sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions\\nof Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark\\nLondon street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his\\nmind off his godfather. He wished he still had\\nQuidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on\\na troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On\\nthe other hand, their lessons were becoming more\\ndifficult and demanding than ever before, particularly\\nMoody’s Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\nTo their surprise, Professor Moody had announced\\nthat he would be putting the Imperius Curse on each\\nof them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see\\nwhether they could resist its effects.\\n“But — but you said it’s illegal, Professor,” said\\nHermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the\\ndesks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear\\nspace in the middle of the room. “You said — to use it\\nagainst another human was — ”\\n“Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,”\\nsaid Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto Hermione\\nand fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. “If\\nyou’d rather learn the hard way — when someone’s\\n \\nputting it on you so they can control you completely\\n— fine by me. You’re excused. Off you go.”\\nHe pointed one gnarled finger toward the door.\\nHermione went very pink and muttered something\\nabout not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry\\nand Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione\\nwould rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an\\nimportant lesson.\\nMoody began to beckon students forward in turn and\\nput the Imperius Curse upon them. Harry watched\\nas, one by one, his classmates did the most\\nextraordinary things under its influence. Dean\\nThomas hopped three times around the room, singing\\nthe national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a\\nsquirrel. Neville performed a series of quite\\nastonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have\\nbeen capable of in his normal state. Not one of them\\nseemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of\\nthem recovered only when Moody had removed it.\\n“Potter,” Moody growled, “you next.”\\nHarry moved forward into the middle of the\\nclassroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of\\ndesks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry,\\nand said, “Imperio\\\\”\\nIt was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating\\nsensation as every thought and worry in his head was\\nwiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague,\\nuntraceable happiness. He stood there feeling\\nimmensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone\\nwatching him.\\nAnd then he heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice, echoing in\\nsome distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto\\nthe desk . . . jump onto the desk. . . .\\n \\nHarry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.\\nJump onto the desk. ...\\nWhy, though? Another voice had awoken in the back\\nof his brain.\\nStupid thing to do, really, said the voice.\\nJump onto the desk. ...\\nNo, I don’t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a\\nlittle more firmly ... no, I don’t really want to. ...\\nJump\\\\ NOW\\nThe next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He\\nhad both jumped and tried to prevent himself from\\njumping — the result was that he’d smashed\\nheadlong into the desk, knocking it over, and, by the\\nfeeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.\\n“Now, that’s more like it!” growled Moody’s voice, and\\nsuddenly, Harry felt the empty, echoing feeling in his\\nhead disappear. He remembered exactly what was\\nhappening, and the pain in his knees seemed to\\ndouble.\\n“Look at that, you lot ... Potter fought! He fought it,\\nand he damn near beat it! We’ll try that again, Potter,\\nand the rest of you, pay attention — watch his eyes,\\nthat’s where you see it — very good, Potter, very good\\nindeed! They’ll have trouble controlling you!”\\n“The way he talks,” Harry muttered as he hobbled out\\nof the Defense Against the Dark Arts class an hour\\nlater (Moody had insisted on putting Harry through\\n \\nhis paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw\\noff the curse entirely), “you’d think we were all going\\nto be attacked any second.”\\n“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, who was skipping on every\\nalternate step. He had had much more difficulty with\\nthe curse than Harry, though Moody assured him the\\neffects would wear off by lunch-time. “Talk about\\nparanoid ...” Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder\\nto check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and\\nwent on. “No wonder they were glad to get shot of him\\nat the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus\\nwhat he did to that witch who shouted ‘Boo’ behind\\nhim on April Fools’ Day? And when are we supposed\\nto read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with\\neverything else we’ve got to do?”\\nAll the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in\\nthe amount of work they were required to do this\\nterm. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the\\nclass gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of\\nTransfiguration homework she had assigned.\\n“You are now entering a most important phase of your\\nmagical education!” she told them, her eyes glinting\\ndangerously behind her square spectacles. “Your\\nOrdinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer — ”\\n“We don’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!” said Dean\\nThomas indignantly.\\n“Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the\\npreparation you can get! Miss Granger remains the\\nonly person in this class who has managed to turn a\\nhedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might\\nremind you that your pincushion, Thomas, still curls\\nup in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed\\nto be trying not to look too pleased with herself.\\nHarry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor\\nTrelawney told them that they had received top marks\\nfor their homework in their next Divination class. She\\nread out large portions of their predictions,\\ncommending them for their unflinching acceptance of\\nthe horrors in store for them — but they were less\\namused when she asked them to do the same thing\\nfor the month after next; both of them were running\\nout of ideas for catastrophes.\\nMeanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught\\nHistory of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on\\nthe goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century.\\nProfessor Snape was forcing them to research\\nantidotes. They took this one seriously, as he had\\nhinted that he might be poisoning one of them before\\nChristmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor\\nFlitwick had asked them to read three extra books in\\npreparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.\\nEven Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-\\nEnded Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace\\ngiven that nobody had yet discovered what they ate.\\nHagrid was delighted, and as part of their “project,”\\nsuggested that they come down to his hut on\\nalternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make\\nnotes on their extraordinary behavior.\\n“I will not,” said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had\\nproposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling\\nan extra- large toy out of his sack. “I see enough of\\nthese foul things during lessons, thanks.”\\nHagrid ’s smile faded off his face.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Yeh’ll do wha’yer told,” he growled, “or I’ll be takin’ a\\nleaf outta Professor Moody’s book. ... I hear yeh made\\na good ferret, Malfoy.”\\nThe Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed\\nwith anger, but apparently the memory of Moody’s\\npunishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him\\nfrom retorting. Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to\\nthe castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits;\\nseeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly\\nsatisfying, especially because Malfoy had done his\\nvery best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year.\\nWhen they arrived in the entrance hall, they found\\nthemselves unable to proceed owing to the large\\ncrowd of students congregated there, all milling\\naround a large sign that had been erected at the foot\\nof the marble staircase. Ron, the tallest of the three,\\nstood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them\\nand read the sign aloud to the other two:\\nTRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT\\nThe delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang\\nwill be arriving at 6 o’clock on Friday the 30th of\\nOctober. Lessons will end half an hour early —\\n“Brilliant!” said Harry. “It’s Potions last thing on\\nFriday! Snape won’t have time to poison us all!”\\nStudents will return their bags and books to their\\ndormitories and assemble in front of the castle to\\ngreet our guests before the Welcoming Feast.\\n“Only a week away!” said Ernie Macmillan of\\nHufflepuff, emerging from the crowd, his eyes\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ngleaming. “I wonder if Cedric knows? Think 111 go and\\ntell him. ...”\\n“Cedric?” said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off.\\n“Diggory,” said Harry. “He must be entering the\\ntournament.”\\n“That idiot, Hogwarts champion?” said Ron as they\\npushed their way through the chattering crowd\\ntoward the staircase.\\n“He’s not an idiot. You just don’t like him because he\\nbeat Gryffindor at Quidditch,” said Hermione. “I’ve\\nheard he’s a really good student — and he’s a\\nprefect.”\\nShe spoke as though this settled the matter.\\n“You only like him because he’s handsome,” said Ron\\nscathingly.\\n“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re\\nhandsome!” said Hermione indignantly.\\nRon gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly\\nlike “Lockhart\\\\”\\nThe appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a\\nmarked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle.\\nDuring the following week, there seemed to be only\\none topic of conversation, no matter where Harry\\nwent: the Triwizard Tournament. Rumors were flying\\nfrom student to student like highly contagious germs:\\nwho was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what\\nthe tournament would involve, how the students from\\nBeauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from\\nthemselves.\\n \\nHarry noticed too that the castle seemed to be\\nundergoing an extra-thorough cleaning. Several grimy\\nportraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure\\nof their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames\\nmuttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw\\npink faces. The suits of armor were suddenly\\ngleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus\\nFilch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to\\nany students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he\\nterrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.\\nOther members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.\\n“Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can’t even\\nperform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone\\nfrom Durmstrang!” Professor McGonagall barked at\\nthe end of one particularly difficult lesson, during\\nwhich Neville had accidentally transplanted his own\\nears onto a cactus.\\nWhen they went down to breakfast on the morning of\\nthe thirtieth of October, they found that the Great\\nHall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk\\nbanners hung from the walls, each of them\\nrepresenting a Hogwarts House: red with a gold lion\\nfor Gryffindor, blue with a bronze eagle for\\nRavenclaw, yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff,\\nand green with a silver serpent for Slytherin. Behind\\nthe teachers’ table, the largest banner of all bore the\\nHogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake\\nunited around a large letter H.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and\\nGeorge at the Gryffindor table. Once again, and most\\nunusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else\\nand conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to\\nthem.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“It’s a bummer, all right,” George was saying gloomily\\nto Fred. “But if he won’t talk to us in person, we’ll\\nhave to send him the letter after all. Or we’ll stuff it\\ninto his hand. He can’t avoid us forever.”\\n“Who’s avoiding you?” said Ron, sitting down next to\\nthem.\\n“Wish you would,” said Fred, looking irritated at the\\ninterruption.\\n“What’s a bummer?” Ron asked George.\\n“Having a nosy git like you for a brother,” said George.\\n“You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament\\nyet?” Harry asked. “Thought any more about trying to\\nenter?”\\n“I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen\\nbut she wasn’t telling,” said George bitterly. “She just\\ntold me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my\\nraccoon.”\\n“Wonder what the tasks are going to be?” said Ron\\nthoughtfully. “You know, I bet we could do them,\\nHarry. We’ve done dangerous stuff before. ...”\\n“Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven’t,” said\\nFred. “McGonagall says the champions get awarded\\npoints according to how well they’ve done the tasks.”\\n“Who are the judges?” Harry asked.\\n“Well, the Heads of the participating schools are\\nalways on the panel,” said Hermione, and everyone\\nlooked around at her, rather surprised, “because all\\nthree of them were injured during the Tournament of\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n1792, when a cockatrice the champions were\\nsupposed to be catching went on the rampage.”\\nShe noticed them all looking at her and said, with her\\nusual air of impatience that nobody else had read all\\nthe books she had, “It’s all in Hogwarts, A History.\\nThough, of course, that book’s not entirely reliable. A\\nRevised History of Hogwarts would be a more\\naccurate title. Or A Highly Biased and Selective\\nHistory of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier\\nAspects of the School.”\\n“What are you on about?” said Ron, though Harry\\nthought he knew what was coming.\\n“ House-elves\\\\” said Hermione, her eyes flashing. “Not\\nonce, in over a thousand pages, does Hogwarts, A\\nHistory mention that we are all colluding in the\\noppression of a hundred slaves!”\\nHarry shook his head and applied himself to his\\nscrambled eggs. His and Ron’s lack of enthusiasm\\nhad done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione ’s\\ndetermination to pursue justice for house-elves. True,\\nboth of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W.\\nbadge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet.\\nTheir Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything,\\nthey seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous.\\nShe had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since,\\nfirst to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do\\nthe same, and she had also taken to rattling around\\nthe Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering\\npeople and shaking the collecting tin under their\\nnoses.\\n“You do realize that your sheets are changed, your\\nfires lit, your classrooms cleaned, and your food\\ncooked by a group of magical creatures who are\\nunpaid and enslaved?” she kept saying fiercely.\\n \\nSome people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop\\nHermione from glowering at them. A few seemed\\nmildly interested in what she had to say, but were\\nreluctant to take a more active role in campaigning.\\nMany regarded the whole thing as a joke.\\nRon now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was\\nflooding them all in autumn sunlight, and Fred\\nbecame extremely interested in his bacon (both twins\\nhad refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George,\\nhowever, leaned in toward Hermione.\\n“Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens,\\nHermione?”\\n“No, of course not,” said Hermione curtly, “I hardly\\nthink students are supposed to — ”\\n“Well, we have,” said George, indicating Fred, “loads\\nof times, to nick food. And we’ve met them, and\\nthey’re happy. They think they’ve got the best job in\\nthe world — ”\\n“That’s because they’re uneducated and\\nbrainwashed!” Hermione began hotly, but her next\\nfew words were drowned out by the sudden\\nwhooshing noise from overhead, which announced\\nthe arrival of the post owls. Harry looked up at once,\\nand saw Hedwig soaring toward him. Hermione\\nstopped talking abruptly; she and Ron watched\\nHedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry’s\\nshoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg\\nwearily.\\nHarry pulled off Sirius’s reply and offered Hedwig his\\nbacon rinds, which she ate gratefully. Then, checking\\nthat Fred and George were safely immersed in further\\ndiscussions about the Tri-wizard Tournament, Harry\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nread out Sirius’s letter in a whisper to Ron and\\nHermione.\\nNice try, Harry.\\nI’m back in the country and well hidden. I want you to\\nkeep me posted on everything that’s going on at\\nHog warts. Don’t use Hedwig, keep changing owls, and\\ndon’t worry about me, just watch out for yourself. Don’t\\nforget what I said about your scar.\\nSirius\\n“Why d’you have to keep changing owls?” Ron asked\\nin a low voice.\\n“Hedwig’ll attract too much attention,” said Hermione\\nat once. “She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps\\nreturning to wherever he’s hiding ... I mean, they’re\\nnot native birds, are they?”\\nHarry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his\\nrobes, wondering whether he felt more or less worried\\nthan before. He supposed that Sirius managing to get\\nback without being caught was something. He\\ncouldn’t deny either that the idea that Sirius was\\nmuch nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn’t\\nhave to wait so long for a response every time he\\nwrote.\\n“Thanks, Hedwig,” he said, stroking her. She hooted\\nsleepily, dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of\\norange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for\\na good long sleep in the Owlery.\\nThere was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air\\nthat day. Nobody was very attentive in lessons, being\\nmuch more interested in the arrival that evening of\\nthe people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even\\n \\nPotions was more bearable than usual, as it was half\\nan hour shorter. When the bell rang early, Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower,\\ndeposited their bags and books as they had been\\ninstructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back\\ndownstairs into the entrance hall.\\nThe Heads of Houses were ordering their students\\ninto lines.\\n“Weasley, straighten your hat,” Professor McGonagall\\nsnapped at Ron. “Miss Patil, take that ridiculous\\nthing out of your hair.”\\nParvati scowled and removed a large ornamental\\nbutterfly from the end of her plait.\\n“Follow me, please,” said Professor McGonagall. “First\\nyears in front ... no pushing. ...”\\nThey filed down the steps and lined up in front of the\\ncastle. It was a cold, clear evening; dusk was falling\\nand a pale, transparent-looking moon was already\\nshining over the Forbidden Forest. Harry, standing\\nbetween Ron and Hermione in the fourth row from\\nthe front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering\\nwith anticipation among the other first years.\\n“Nearly six,” said Ron, checking his watch and then\\nstaring down the drive that led to the front gates.\\n“How d’you reckon they’re coming? The train?”\\n“I doubt it,” said Hermione.\\n“How, then? Broomsticks?” Harry suggested, looking\\nup at the starry sky.\\n“I don’t think so ... not from that far away. ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“A Portkey?” Ron suggested. “Or they could Apparate\\n— maybe you’re allowed to do it under seventeen\\nwherever they come from?”\\n“You can’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds,\\nhow often do I have to tell you?” said Hermione\\nimpatiently.\\nThey scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but\\nnothing was moving; everything was still, silent, and\\nquite as usual. Harry was starting to feel cold. He\\nwished they’d hurry up. ... Maybe the foreign\\nstudents were preparing a dramatic entrance. ... He\\nremembered what Mr. Weasley had said back at the\\ncampsite before the Quidditch World Cup: “always the\\nsame — we can’t resist showing off when we get\\ntogether. ...”\\nAnd then Dumbledore called out from the back row\\nwhere he stood with the other teachers —\\n“Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation\\nfrom Beauxbatons approaches!”\\n“Where?” said many students eagerly, all looking in\\ndifferent directions.\\n“There!” yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest.\\nSomething large, much larger than a broomstick —\\nor, indeed, a hundred broomsticks — was hurtling\\nacross the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing\\nlarger all the time.\\n“It’s a dragon!” shrieked one of the first years, losing\\nher head completely.\\n“Don’t be stupid ... it’s a flying house!” said Dennis\\nCreevey.\\n \\nDennis’s guess was closer. ... As the gigantic black\\nshape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden\\nForest and the lights shining from the castle windows\\nhit it, they saw a gigantic, powder-blue, horse-drawn\\ncarriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward\\nthem, pulled through the air by a dozen winged\\nhorses, all palominos, and each the size of an\\nelephant.\\nThe front three rows of students drew backward as\\nthe carriage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a\\ntremendous speed — then, with an almighty crash\\nthat made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin\\nfifth year’s foot, the horses’ hooves, larger than dinner\\nplates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage\\nlanded too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the\\ngolden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled\\nlarge, fiery red eyes.\\nHarry just had time to see that the door of the\\ncarriage bore a coat of arms (two crossed, golden\\nwands, each emitting three stars) before it opened.\\nA boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the\\ncarriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with\\nsomething on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of\\ngolden steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then\\nHarry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging\\nfrom the inside of the carriage — a shoe the size of a\\nchild’s sled — followed, almost immediately, by the\\nlargest woman he had ever seen in his life. The size of\\nthe carriage, and of the horses, was immediately\\nexplained. A few people gasped.\\nHarry had only ever seen one person as large as this\\nwoman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted\\nwhether there was an inch difference in their heights.\\nYet somehow — maybe simply because he was used\\nto Hagrid — this woman (now at the foot of the steps,\\n \\nand looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd)\\nseemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped\\ninto the light flooding from the entrance hall, she was\\nrevealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face;\\nlarge, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky\\nnose. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at\\nthe base of her neck. She was dressed from head to\\nfoot in black satin, and many magnificent opals\\ngleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.\\nDumbledore started to clap; the students, following\\nhis lead, broke into applause too, many of them\\nstanding on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.\\nHer face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked\\nforward toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering\\nhand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to\\nbend to kiss it.\\n“My dear Madame Maxime,” he said. “Welcome to\\nHogwarts.”\\n“Dumbly-dorr,” said Madame Maxime in a deep voice.\\n“I ’ope I find you well?”\\n“In excellent form, I thank you,” said Dumbledore.\\n“My pupils,” said Madame Maxime, waving one of her\\nenormous hands carelessly behind her.\\nHarry, whose attention had been focused completely\\nupon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a\\ndozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their\\nlate teens, had emerged from the carriage and were\\nnow standing behind Madame Maxime. They were\\nshivering, which was unsurprising, given that their\\nrobes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of\\nthem were wearing cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves\\nand shawls around their heads. From what Harry\\n \\ncould see of them (they were standing in Madame\\nMaxime ’s enormous shadow), they were staring up at\\nHogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces.\\n“ ’As Karkaroff arrived yet?” Madame Maxime asked.\\n“He should be here any moment,” said Dumbledore.\\n“Would you like to wait here and greet him or would\\nyou prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?”\\n“Warm up, I think,” said Madame Maxime. “But ze\\n’orses — ”\\n“Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be\\ndelighted to take care of them,” said Dumbledore, “the\\nmoment he has returned from dealing with a slight\\nsituation that has arisen with some of his other — er\\n— charges.”\\n“Skrewts,” Ron muttered to Harry, grinning.\\n“My steeds require — er — forceful ’andling,” said\\nMadame Maxime, looking as though she doubted\\nwhether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at\\nHogwarts could be up to the job. “Zey are very strong.\\n“I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,”\\nsaid Dumbledore, smiling.\\n“Very well,” said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly.\\n“Will you please inform zis ’Agrid zat ze ’orses drink\\nonly single-malt whiskey?”\\n“It will be attended to,” said Dumbledore, also bowing.\\n“Come,” said Madame Maxime imperiously to her\\nstudents, and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her\\nand her students to pass up the stone steps.\\n \\n“How big d’you reckon Durmstrang’s horses are going\\nto be?” Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around\\nLavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.\\n“Well, if they’re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid\\nwon’t be able to handle them,” said Harry. “That’s if\\nhe hasn’t been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder\\nwhat’s up with them?”\\n“Maybe they’ve escaped,” said Ron hopefully.\\n“Oh don’t say that,” said Hermione with a shudder.\\n“Imagine that lot loose on the grounds. ...”\\nThey stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the\\nDurmstrang party to arrive. Most people were gazing\\nhopefully up at the sky. For a few minutes, the\\nsilence was broken only by Madame Maxime’s huge\\nhorses snorting and stamping. But then —\\n“Can you hear something?” said Ron suddenly.\\nHarry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was\\ndrifting toward them from out of the darkness: a\\nmuffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an\\nimmense vacuum cleaner were moving along a\\nriverbed. ...\\n“The lake!” yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it.\\n“Look at the lake!”\\nFrom their position at the top of the lawns\\noverlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the\\nsmooth black surface of the water — except that the\\nsurface was suddenly not smooth at all. Some\\ndisturbance was taking place deep in the center; great\\nbubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now\\nwashing over the muddy banks — and then, out in\\nthe very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if\\n \\na giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake’s\\nfloor. ...\\nWhat seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise\\nslowly out of the heart of the whirlpool . . . and then\\nHarry saw the rigging. . . .\\n“It’s a mast!” he said to Ron and Hermione.\\nSlowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water,\\ngleaming in the moonlight. It had a strangely skeletal\\nlook about it, as though it were a resurrected wreck,\\nand the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes\\nlooked like ghostly eyes. Finally, with a great sloshing\\nnoise, the ship emerged entirely, bobbing on the\\nturbulent water, and began to glide toward the bank.\\nA few moments later, they heard the splash of an\\nanchor being thrown down in the shallows, and the\\nthud of a plank being lowered onto the bank.\\nPeople were disembarking; they could see their\\nsilhouettes passing the lights in the ship’s portholes.\\nAll of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along\\nthe lines of Crabbe and Goyle . . . but then, as they\\ndrew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light\\nstreaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their\\nbulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing\\ncloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur. But the\\nman who was leading them up to the castle was\\nwearing furs of a different sort: sleek and silver, like\\nhis hair.\\n“Dumbledore!” he called heartily as he walked up the\\nslope. “How are you, my dear fellow, how are you?”\\n“Blooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,”\\nDumbledore replied.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nKarkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he\\nstepped into the light pouring from the front doors of\\nthe castle they saw that he was tall and thin like\\nDumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his\\ngoatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide\\nhis rather weak chin. When he reached Dumbledore,\\nhe shook hands with both of his own.\\n“Dear old Hogwarts,” he said, looking up at the castle\\nand smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and Harry\\nnoticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes,\\nwhich remained cold and shrewd. “How good it is to\\nbe here, how good. ... Viktor, come along, into the\\nwarmth ... you don’t mind, Dumbledore? Viktor has a\\nslight head cold. ...”\\nKarkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As\\nthe boy passed, Harry caught a glimpse of a\\nprominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He\\ndidn’t need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or\\nthe hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile.\\n“Harry — it’s Krum\\\\”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nt\\'fyfflapier- l6\\nTHE GOBLET OF FIRE\\n“I don’t believe it!” Ron said, in a stunned voice, as\\nthe Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind\\nthe party from Durmstrang. “Krum, Harry! Viktor\\nKruml”\\n“For heaven’s sake, Ron, he’s only a Quidditch\\nplayer,” said Hermione.\\n“Only a Quidditch player?” Ron said, looking at her as\\nthough he couldn’t believe his ears. “Hermione — he’s\\none of the best Seekers in the world! I had no idea he\\nwas still at school!”\\nAs they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of\\nthe Hogwarts students heading for the Great Hall,\\nHarry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the\\nsoles of his feet to get a better look at the back of\\nKrum’s head. Several sixth-year girls were frantically\\nsearching their pockets as they walked —\\n“Oh I don’t believe it, I haven’t got a single quill on me\\n??\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“D’you think he’d sign my hat in lipstick?”\\n“Really,” Hermione said loftily as they passed the\\ngirls, now squabbling over the lipstick.\\n“I’m getting his autograph if I can,” said Ron. “You\\nhaven’t got a quill, have you, Harry?”\\n“Nope, they’re upstairs in my bag,” said Harry.\\nThey walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat\\ndown. Ron took care to sit on the side facing the\\ndoorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang\\nstudents were still gathered around it, apparently\\nunsure about where they should sit. The students\\nfrom Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw\\ntable. They were looking around the Great Hall with\\nglum expressions on their faces. Three of them were\\nstill clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.\\n“It’s not that cold,” said Hermione defensively. “Why\\ndidn’t they bring cloaks?”\\n“Over here! Come and sit over here!” Ron hissed.\\n“Over here! Hermione, budge up, make a space — ”\\n“What?”\\n“Too late,” said Ron bitterly.\\nViktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had\\nsettled themselves at the Slytherin table. Harry could\\nsee Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug\\nabout this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forward to\\nspeak to Krum.\\n“Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,” said\\nRon scathingly. “I bet Krum can see right through\\nhim, though ... bet he gets people fawning over him\\n \\nall the time. ... Where d’you reckon they’re going to\\nsleep? We could offer him a space in our dormitory,\\nHarry ... I wouldn’t mind giving him my bed, I could\\nkip on a camp bed.”\\nHermione snorted.\\n“They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,”\\nsaid Harry.\\nThe Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy\\nfurs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with\\nexpressions of interest; a couple of them were picking\\nup the golden plates and goblets and examining\\nthem, apparently impressed.\\nUp at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding\\nchairs. He was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in\\nhonor of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see\\nthat he added four chairs, two on either side of\\nDumbledore’s.\\n“But there are only two extra people,” Harry said.\\n“Why’s Filch putting out four chairs, who else is\\ncoming?”\\n“Eh?” said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at\\nKrum.\\nWhen all the students had entered the Hall and\\nsettled down at their House tables, the staff entered,\\nfiling up to the top table and taking their seats. Last\\nin line were Professor Dumbledore, Professor\\nKarkaroff, and Madame Maxime. When their\\nheadmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons\\nleapt to their feet. A few of the Hogwarts students\\nlaughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared quite\\nunembarrassed, however, and did not resume their\\nseats until Madame Maxime had sat down on\\n \\nDumbledore ’s left-hand side. Dumbledore remained\\nstanding, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.\\n“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and —\\nmost particularly — guests,” said Dumbledore,\\nbeaming around at the foreign students. “I have great\\npleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and\\ntrust that your stay here will be both comfortable and\\nenjoyable.”\\nOne of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler\\naround her head gave what was unmistakably a\\nderisive laugh.\\n“No one’s making you stay!” Hermione whispered,\\nbristling at her.\\n“The tournament will be officially opened at the end of\\nthe feast,” said Dumbledore. “I now invite you all to\\neat, drink, and make yourselves at home!”\\nHe sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at\\nonce and engage him in conversation.\\nThe plates in front of them filled with food as usual.\\nThe house-elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled\\nout all the stops; there was a greater variety of dishes\\nin front of them than Harry had ever seen, including\\nseveral that were definitely foreign.\\n“What’s that?” said Ron, pointing at a large dish of\\nsome sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large\\nsteak-and-kidney pudding.\\n“Bouillabaisse,” said Hermione.\\n“Bless you,” said Ron.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“It’s French,” said Hermione, “I had it on holiday\\nsummer before last. It’s very nice.”\\n“I’ll take your word for it,” said Ron, helping himself\\nto black pudding.\\nThe Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded\\nthan usual, even though there were barely twenty\\nadditional students there; perhaps it was because\\ntheir differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly\\nagainst the black of the Hogwarts’ robes. Now that\\nthey had removed their furs, the Durmstrang\\nstudents were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep\\nbloodred.\\nHagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the\\nstaff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast.\\nHe slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged\\nhand.\\n“Skrewts doing all right, Hagrid?” Harry called.\\n“Thrivin’,” Hagrid called back happily.\\n“Yeah, I’ll just bet they are,” said Ron quietly. “Looks\\nlike they’ve finally found a food they like, doesn’t it?\\nHagrid ’s fingers.”\\nAt that moment, a voice said, “Excuse me, are you\\nwanting ze bouillabaisse?”\\nIt was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed\\nduring Dumbledore’s speech. She had finally removed\\nher muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde hair fell\\nalmost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes,\\nand very white, even teeth.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nRon went purple. He stared up at her, opened his\\nmouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint\\ngurgling noise.\\n“Yeah, have it,” said Harry, pushing the dish toward\\nthe girl.\\n“You ’ave finished wiz it?”\\n“Yeah,” Ron said breathlessly. “Yeah, it was\\nexcellent.”\\nThe girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off\\nto the Ravenclaw table. Ron was still goggling at the\\ngirl as though he had never seen one before. Harry\\nstarted to laugh. The sound seemed to jog Ron back\\nto his senses.\\n“She’s a veelcd” he said hoarsely to Harry.\\n“Of course she isn’t!” said Hermione tartly. “I don’t see\\nanyone else gaping at her like an idiot!”\\nBut she wasn’t entirely right about that. As the girl\\ncrossed the Hall, many boys’ heads turned, and some\\nof them seemed to have become temporarily\\nspeechless, just like Ron.\\n“I’m telling you, that’s not a normal girl!” said Ron,\\nleaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her.\\n“They don’t make them like that at Hogwarts!”\\n“They make them okay at Hogwarts,” said Harry\\nwithout thinking. Cho happened to be sitting only a\\nfew places away from the girl with the silvery hair.\\n“When you’ve both put your eyes back in,” said\\nHermione briskly, “you’ll be able to see who’s just\\narrived.”\\n \\nShe was pointing up at the staff table. The two\\nremaining empty seats had just been filled. Ludo\\nBagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff’s\\nother side, while Mr. Crouch, Percy’s boss, was next\\nto Madame Maxime.\\n“What are they doing here?” said Harry in surprise.\\n“They organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn’t\\nthey?” said Hermione. “I suppose they wanted to be\\nhere to see it start.”\\nWhen the second course arrived they noticed a\\nnumber of unfamiliar desserts too. Ron examined an\\nodd sort of pale blancmange closely, then moved it\\ncarefully a few inches to his right, so that it would be\\nclearly visible from the Ravenclaw table. The girl who\\nlooked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough,\\nhowever, and did not come over to get it.\\nOnce the golden plates had been wiped clean,\\nDumbledore stood up again. A pleasant sort of\\ntension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight\\nthrill of excitement, wondering what was coming.\\nSeveral seats down from them, Fred and George were\\nleaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great\\nconcentration.\\n“The moment has come,” said Dumbledore, smiling\\naround at the sea of upturned faces. “The Triwizard\\nTournament is about to start. I would like to say a few\\nwords of explanation before we bring in the casket — ”\\n“The what?” Harry muttered.\\nRon shrugged.\\n“ — just to clarify the procedure that we will be\\nfollowing this year. But first, let me introduce, for\\n \\nthose who do not know them, Mr. Bartemius Crouch,\\nHead of the Department of International Magical\\nCooperation” — there was a smattering of polite\\napplause — “and Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the\\nDepartment of Magical Games and Sports.”\\nThere was a much louder round of applause for\\nBagman than for Crouch, perhaps because of his\\nfame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so\\nmuch more likable. He acknowledged it with a jovial\\nwave of his hand. Bartemius Crouch did not smile or\\nwave when his name was announced. Remembering\\nhim in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup,\\nHarry thought he looked strange in wizard’s robes.\\nHis toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked\\nvery odd next to Dumbledore’s long white hair and\\nbeard.\\n“Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly\\nover the last few months on the arrangements for the\\nTriwizard Tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “and\\nthey will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and\\nMadame Maxime on the panel that will judge the\\nchampions’ efforts.”\\nAt the mention of the word “champions,” the\\nattentiveness of the listening students seemed to\\nsharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their\\nsudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, “The\\ncasket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.”\\nFilch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner\\nof the Hall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a\\ngreat wooden chest encrusted with jewels. It looked\\nextremely old. A murmur of excited interest rose from\\nthe watching students; Dennis Creevey actually stood\\non his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his\\nhead hardly rose above anyone else’s.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“The instructions for the tasks the champions will\\nface this year have already been examined by Mr.\\nCrouch and Mr. Bagman,” said Dumbledore as Filch\\nplaced the chest carefully on the table before him,\\n“and they have made the necessary arrangements for\\neach challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced\\nthroughout the school year, and they will test the\\nchampions in many different ways . . . their magical\\nprowess — their daring — their powers of deduction\\n— and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.”\\nAt this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so\\nabsolute that nobody seemed to be breathing.\\n“As you know, three champions compete in the\\ntournament,” Dumbledore went on calmly, “one from\\neach of the participating schools. They will be marked\\non how well they perform each of the Tournament\\ntasks and the champion with the highest total after\\ntask three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions\\nwill be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of\\nFire.”\\nDumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three\\ntimes upon the top of the casket. The lid creaked\\nslowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled\\nout a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have\\nbeen entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the\\nbrim with dancing blue-white flames.\\nDumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet\\ncarefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible\\nto everyone in the Hall.\\n“Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion\\nmust write their name and school clearly upon a slip\\nof parchment and drop it into the goblet,” said\\nDumbledore. “Aspiring champions have twenty-four\\nhours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow\\n \\nnight, Halloween, the goblet will return the names of\\nthe three it has judged most worthy to represent their\\nschools. The goblet will be placed in the entrance hall\\ntonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those\\nwishing to compete.\\n“To ensure that no underage student yields to\\ntemptation,” said Dumbledore, “I will be drawing an\\nAge Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been\\nplaced in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of\\nseventeen will be able to cross this line.\\n“Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to\\ncompete that this tournament is not to be entered\\ninto lightly. Once a champion has been selected by\\nthe Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the\\ntournament through to the end. The placing of your\\nname in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical\\ncontract. There can be no change of heart once you\\nhave become a champion. Please be very sure,\\ntherefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to\\nplay before you drop your name into the goblet. Now,\\nI think it is time for bed. Good night to you all.”\\n“An Age Line!” Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as\\nthey all made their way across the Hall to the doors\\ninto the entrance hall. “Well, that should be fooled by\\nan Aging Potion, shouldn’t it? And once your name’s\\nin that goblet, you’re laughing — it can’t tell whether\\nyou’re seventeen or not!”\\n“But I don’t think anyone under seventeen will stand\\na chance,” said Hermione, “we just haven’t learned\\nenough ...”\\n“Speak for yourself,” said George shortly. “You’ll try\\nand get in, won’t you, Harry?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry thought briefly of Dumbledore ’s insistence that\\nnobody under seventeen should submit their name,\\nbut then the wonderful picture of himself winning the\\nTriwizard Tournament filled his mind again. ... He\\nwondered how angry Dumbledore would be if\\nsomeone younger than seventeen did find a way to get\\nover the Age Line. ...\\n“Where is he?” said Ron, who wasn’t listening to a\\nword of this conversation, but looking through the\\ncrowd to see what had become of Krum. “Dumbledore\\ndidn’t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping,\\ndid he?”\\nBut this query was answered almost instantly; they\\nwere level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff\\nhad just bustled up to his students.\\n“Back to the ship, then,” he was saying. “Viktor, how\\nare you feeling? Did you eat enough? Should I send\\nfor some mulled wine from the kitchens?”\\nHarry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs\\nback on.\\n“Professor, I vood like some vine,” said one of the\\nother Durmstrang boys hopefully.\\n“I wasn’t offering it to you, Poliakoff,” snapped\\nKarkaroff, his warmly paternal air vanishing in an\\ninstant. “I notice you have dribbled food all down the\\nfront of your robes again, disgusting boy — ”\\nKarkaroff turned and led his students toward the\\ndoors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry stopped to let him\\nwalk through first.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Thank you,” said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at\\nhim.\\nAnd then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to\\nHarry and stared at him as though he couldn’t believe\\nhis eyes. Behind their headmaster, the students from\\nDurmstrang came to a halt too. Karkaroff s eyes\\nmoved slowly up Harry’s face and fixed upon his scar.\\nThe Durmstrang students were staring curiously at\\nHarry too. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw\\ncomprehension dawn on a few of their faces. The boy\\nwith food all down his front nudged the girl next to\\nhim and pointed openly at Harry’s forehead.\\n“Yeah, that’s Harry Potter,” said a growling voice from\\nbehind them.\\nProfessor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody\\nwas standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his\\nmagical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang\\nheadmaster.\\nThe color drained from Karkaroff’s face as Harry\\nwatched. A terrible look of mingled fury and fear came\\nover him.\\n“You!” he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he\\nwas really seeing him.\\n“Me,” said Moody grimly. “And unless you’ve got\\nanything to say to Potter, Karkaroff, you might want\\nto move. You’re blocking the doorway.”\\nIt was true; half the students in the Hall were now\\nwaiting behind them, looking over one another’s\\nshoulders to see what was causing the holdup.\\nWithout another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his\\nstudents away with him. Moody watched him until he\\n \\nwas out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back,\\na look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.\\nAs the next day was Saturday, most students would\\nnormally have breakfasted late. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione, however, were not alone in rising much\\nearlier than they usually did on weekends. When they\\nwent down into the entrance hall, they saw about\\ntwenty people milling around it, some of them eating\\ntoast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been\\nplaced in the center of the hall on the stool that\\nnormally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had\\nbeen traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet\\naround it in every direction.\\n“Anyone put their name in yet?” Ron asked a third-\\nyear girl eagerly.\\n“All the Durmstrang lot,” she replied. “But I haven’t\\nseen anyone from Hogwarts yet.”\\n“Bet some of them put it in last night after we’d all\\ngone to bed,” said Harry. “I would’ve if it had been me\\n... wouldn’t have wanted everyone watching. What if\\nthe goblet just gobbed you right back out again?”\\nSomeone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw\\nFred, George, and Lee Jordan hurrying down the\\nstaircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.\\n“Done it,” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione. “Just taken it.”\\n“What?” said Ron.\\n“The Aging Potion, dung brains,” said Fred.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“One drop each,” said George, rubbing his hands\\ntogether with glee. “We only need to be a few months\\nolder.”\\n“We’re going to split the thousand Galleons between\\nthe three of us if one of us wins,” said Lee, grinning\\nbroadly.\\n“I’m not sure this is going to work, you know,” said\\nHermione warningly “I’m sure Dumbledore will have\\nthought of this.”\\nFred, George, and Lee ignored her.\\n“Ready?” Fred said to the other two, quivering with\\nexcitement. “C’mon, then — I’ll go first — ”\\nHarry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of\\nparchment out of his pocket bearing the words Fred\\nWeasley — Hog warts. Fred walked right up to the\\nedge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes\\nlike a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop. Then, with\\nthe eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon\\nhim, he took a great breath and stepped over the line.\\nFor a split second Harry thought it had worked —\\nGeorge certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of\\ntriumph and leapt after Fred — but next moment,\\nthere was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were\\nhurled out of the golden circle as though they had\\nbeen thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed\\npainfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to\\nadd insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise,\\nand both of them sprouted identical long white\\nbeards.\\nThe entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and\\nGeorge joined in, once they had gotten to their feet\\nand taken a good look at each other’s beards.\\n \\n“I did warn you,” said a deep, amused voice, and\\neveryone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming\\nout of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and George,\\nhis eyes twinkling. “I suggest you both go up to\\nMadam Pomfrey. She is already tending to Miss\\nFawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of\\nHufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves\\nup a little too. Though I must say, neither of their\\nbeards is anything like as fine as yours.”\\nFred and George set off for the hospital wing,\\naccompanied by Lee, who was howling with laughter,\\nand Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went\\nin to breakfast.\\nThe decorations in the Great Hall had changed this\\nmorning. As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was\\nfluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while\\nhundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every\\ncorner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus,\\nwho were discussing those Hogwarts students of\\nseventeen or over who might be entering.\\n“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up\\nearly and put his name in,” Dean told Harry. “That\\nbig bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.”\\nHarry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington,\\nshook his head in disgust.\\n“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”\\n“And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,”\\nsaid Seamus contemptuously. “But I wouldn’t have\\nthought he’d have wanted to risk his good looks.”\\n“Listen!” said Hermione suddenly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nPeople were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all\\nswiveled around in their seats and saw Angelina\\nJohnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an\\nembarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who played\\nChaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina\\ncame over to them, sat down, and said, “Well, I’ve\\ndone it! Just put my name in!”\\n“You’re kidding!” said Ron, looking impressed.\\n“Are you seventeen, then?” asked Harry.\\n“ ’Course she is, can’t see a beard, can you?” said\\nRon.\\n“I had my birthday last week,” said Angelina.\\n“Well, I’m glad someone from Gryffindor’s entering,”\\nsaid Hermione. “I really hope you get it, Angelina!”\\n“Thanks, Hermione,” said Angelina, smiling at her.\\n“Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory,” said\\nSeamus, causing several Hufflepuffs passing their\\ntable to scowl heavily at him.\\n“What’re we going to do today, then?” Ron asked\\nHarry and Hermione when they had finished\\nbreakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.\\n“We haven’t been down to visit Hagrid yet,” said\\nHarry.\\n“Okay,” said Ron, “just as long as he doesn’t ask us to\\ndonate a few fingers to the skrewts.”\\nA look of great excitement suddenly dawned on\\nHermione ’s face.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I’ve just realized — I haven’t asked Hagrid to join\\nS.P.E.W. yet!” she said brightly. “Wait for me, will\\nyou, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?”\\n“What is it with her?” said Ron, exasperated, as\\nHermione ran away up the marble staircase.\\n“Hey, Ron,” said Harry suddenly. “It’s your friend ...”\\nThe students from Beauxbatons were coming through\\nthe front doors from the grounds, among them, the\\nveela-girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire\\nstood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.\\nMadame Maxime entered the hall behind her students\\nand organized them into a line. One by one, the\\nBeauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line\\nand dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-\\nwhite flames. As each name entered the fire, it turned\\nbriefly red and emitted sparks.\\n“What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who aren’t\\nchosen?” Ron muttered to Harry as the veela-girl\\ndropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire.\\n“Reckon they’ll go back to school, or hang around to\\nwatch the tournament?”\\n“Dunno,” said Harry. “Hang around, I suppose. ...\\nMadame Maxime’s staying to judge, isn’t she?”\\nWhen all the Beauxbatons students had submitted\\ntheir names, Madame Maxime led them back out of\\nthe hall and out onto the grounds again.\\n“Where are they sleeping, then?” said Ron, moving\\ntoward the front doors and staring after them.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nA loud rattling noise behind them announced\\nHermione’s reappearance with the box of S.P.E.W.\\nbadges.\\n“Oh good, hurry up,” said Ron, and he jumped down\\nthe stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the\\nveela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with\\nMadame Maxime.\\nAs they neared Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the\\nForbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons’\\nsleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic powder-\\nblue carriage in which they had arrived had been\\nparked two hundred yards from Hagrid’s front door,\\nand the students were climbing back inside it. The\\nelephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage\\nwere now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it.\\nHarry knocked on Hagrid’s door, and Fang’s booming\\nbarks answered instantly\\n“ ’Bout time!” said Hagrid, when he’d flung open the\\ndoor. “Thought you lot’d forgotten where I live!”\\n“We’ve been really busy, Hag — ” Hermione started to\\nsay, but then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid,\\napparently lost for words.\\nHagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy\\nbrown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie.\\nThis wasn’t the worst of it, though; he had evidently\\ntried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what\\nappeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked down\\ninto two bunches — perhaps he had tried a ponytail\\nlike Bill’s, but found he had too much hair. The look\\ndidn’t really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment,\\nHermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding\\nnot to comment, she said, “Erm — where are the\\nskrewts?”\\n \\n“Out by the pumpkin patch,” said Hagrid happily.\\n“They’re gettin’ massive, mus’ be nearly three foot\\nlong now. On’y trouble is, they’ve started killin’ each\\nother.”\\n“Oh no, really?” said Hermione, shooting a repressive\\nlook at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid’s odd hairstyle,\\nhad just opened his mouth to say something about it.\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid sadly. “ ’S’ okay, though, I’ve got\\n’em in separate boxes now. Still got abou’ twenty.”\\n“Well, that’s lucky,” said Ron. Hagrid missed the\\nsarcasm.\\nHagrid’s cabin comprised a single room, in one corner\\nof which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork\\nquilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs\\nstood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured\\nhams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. They\\nsat down at the table while Hagrid started to make\\ntea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion\\nof the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as\\nexcited about it as they were.\\n“You wait,” he said, grinning. “You jus’ wait. Yer going\\nter see some stuff yeh’ve never seen before. Firs’ task\\n... ah, but I’m not supposed ter say.”\\n“Go on, Hagrid!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged\\nhim, but he just shook his head, grinning.\\n“I don’ want ter spoil it fer yeh,” said Hagrid. “But it’s\\ngonna be spectacular, I’ll tell yeh that. Them\\nchampions ’re going ter have their work cut out. Never\\nthought I’d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament\\nplayed again!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThey ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they\\ndidn’t eat much — Hagrid had made what he said was\\na beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a\\nlarge talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost\\ntheir appetites. However, they enjoyed themselves\\ntrying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the\\ntournament were going to be, speculating which of\\nthe entrants were likely to be selected as champions,\\nand wondering whether Fred and George were\\nbeardless yet.\\nA light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was\\nvery cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle\\npatter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid\\ndarning his socks and arguing with Hermione about\\nhouse-elves — for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W.\\nwhen she showed him her badges.\\n“It’d be doin’ ’em an unkindness, Hermione,” he said\\ngravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick\\nyellow yarn. “It’s in their nature ter look after\\nhumans, that’s what they like, see? Yeh’d be makin’\\n’em unhappy ter take away their work, an’ insultin’\\n’em if yeh tried ter pay ’em.”\\n“But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon\\nabout it!” said Hermione. “And we heard he’s asking\\nfor wages now!”\\n“Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I’m not\\nsayin’ there isn’t the odd elf who’d take freedom, but\\nyeh’ll never persuade most of ’em ter do it — no,\\nnothin’ doin’, Hermione.”\\nHermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her\\nbox of badges back into her cloak pocket.\\nBy half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry,\\nand Hermione decided it was time to get back up to\\n \\nthe castle for the Halloween feast — and, more\\nimportant, the announcement of the school\\nchampions.\\n“I’ll come with yeh,” said Hagrid, putting away his\\ndarning. “Jus’ give us a sec.”\\nHagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers\\nbeside his bed, and began searching for something\\ninside it. They didn’t pay too much attention until a\\ntruly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing,\\nRon said, “Hagrid, what’s that?”\\n“Eh?” said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle\\nin his hand. “Don’ yeh like it?”\\n“Is that aftershave?” said Hermione in a slightly\\nchoked voice.\\n“Er — eau de cologne,” Hagrid muttered. He was\\nblushing. “Maybe it’s a bit much,” he said gruffly. “I’ll\\ngo take it off, hang on . . .\\nHe stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him\\nwashing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside\\nthe window.\\n“Eau de cologne?” said Hermione in amazement.\\n“Hagrid?”\\n“And what’s with the hair and the suit?” said Harry in\\nan undertone.\\n“Look!” said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the\\nwindow.\\nHagrid had just straightened up and turned ’round. If\\nhe had been blushing before, it was nothing to what\\nhe was doing now. Getting to their feet very\\n \\ncautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn’t spot them, Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione peered through the window and\\nsaw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons\\nstudents had just emerged from their carriage, clearly\\nabout to set off for the feast too. They couldn’t hear\\nwhat Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to\\nMadame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression\\nHarry had only ever seen him wear once before —\\nwhen he had been looking at the baby dragon,\\nNorbert.\\n“He’s going up to the castle with her!” said Hermione\\nindignantly. “I thought he was waiting for us!”\\nWithout so much as a backward glance at his cabin,\\nHagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame\\nMaxime, the Beauxbatons students following in their\\nwake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.\\n“He fancies her!” said Ron incredulously. “Well, if they\\nend up having children, they’ll be setting a world\\nrecord — bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a\\nton.”\\nThey let themselves out of the cabin and shut the\\ndoor behind them. It was surprisingly dark outside.\\nDrawing their cloaks more closely around themselves,\\nthey set off up the sloping lawns.\\n“Ooh it’s them, look!” Hermione whispered.\\nThe Durmstrang party was walking up toward the\\ncastle from the lake. Viktor Krum was walking side by\\nside with Karkaroff, and the other Durmstrang\\nstudents were straggling along behind them. Ron\\nwatched Krum excitedly, but Krum did not look\\naround as he reached the front doors a little ahead of\\nHermione, Ron, and Harry and proceeded through\\nthem.\\n \\nWhen they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was\\nalmost full. The Goblet of Fire had been moved; it was\\nnow standing in front of Dumbledore ’s empty chair at\\nthe teachers’ table. Fred and George — clean-shaven\\nagain — seemed to have taken their disappointment\\nfairly well.\\n“Hope it’s Angelina,” said Fred as Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione sat down.\\n“So do I!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Well, we’ll\\nsoon know!”\\nThe Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than\\nusual. Perhaps because it was their second feast in\\ntwo days, Harry didn’t seem to fancy the\\nextravagantly prepared food as much as he would\\nhave normally. Like everyone else in the Hall, judging\\nby the constantly craning necks, the impatient\\nexpressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the\\nstanding up to see whether Dumbledore had finished\\neating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear,\\nand to hear who had been selected as champions.\\nAt long last, the golden plates returned to their\\noriginal spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in\\nthe level of noise within the Hall, which died away\\nalmost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. On\\neither side of him, Professor Karkaroff and Madame\\nMaxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone.\\nLudo Bagman was beaming and winking at various\\nstudents. Mr. Crouch, however, looked quite\\nuninterested, almost bored.\\n“Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,”\\nsaid Dumbledore. “I estimate that it requires one\\nmore minute. Now, when the champions’ names are\\ncalled, I would ask them please to come up to the top\\nof the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through\\n \\ninto the next chamber” — he indicated the door\\nbehind the staff table — “where they will be receiving\\ntheir first instructions.”\\nHe took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave\\nwith it; at once, all the candles except those inside the\\ncarved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them\\ninto a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now\\nshone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall,\\nthe sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames\\nalmost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched,\\nwaiting. ... A few people kept checking their watches.\\n“Any second,” Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away\\nfrom Harry.\\nThe flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red\\nagain. Sparks began to fly from it. Next moment, a\\ntongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of\\nparchment fluttered out of it — the whole room\\ngasped.\\nDumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held\\nit at arm’s length, so that he could read it by the light\\nof the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.\\n“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong,\\nclear voice, “will be Viktor Krum.”\\n“No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of\\napplause and cheering swept the Hall. Harry saw\\nViktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch\\nup toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along\\nthe staff table, and disappeared through the door into\\nthe next chamber.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Bravo, Viktor!” boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that\\neveryone could hear him, even over all the applause.\\n“Knew you had it in you!”\\nThe clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone’s\\nattention was focused again on the goblet, which,\\nseconds later, turned red once more. A second piece\\nof parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.\\n“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore,\\n“is Fleur Delacour!”\\n“It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so\\nresembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook\\nback her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up\\nbetween the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.\\n“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said\\nover the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the\\nBeauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of an\\nunderstatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who\\nhad not been selected had dissolved into tears and\\nwere sobbing with their heads on their arms.\\nWhen Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side\\nchamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a\\nsilence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste\\nit. The Hogwarts champion next ...\\nAnd the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks\\nshowered out of it; the tongue of flame shot high into\\nthe air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third\\npiece of parchment.\\n“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric\\nDiggory!”\\n“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except\\nHarry; the uproar from the next table was too great.\\n \\nEvery single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet,\\nscreaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way\\npast them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward\\nthe chamber behind the teachers’ table. Indeed, the\\napplause for Cedric went on so long that it was some\\ntime before Dumbledore could make himself heard\\nagain.\\n“Excellent!” Dumbledore called happily as at last the\\ntumult died down. “Well, we now have our three\\nchampions. I am sure I can count upon all of you,\\nincluding the remaining students from Beauxbatons\\nand Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce\\nof support you can muster. By cheering your\\nchampion on, you will contribute in a very real — ”\\nBut Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it\\nwas apparent to everybody what had distracted him.\\nThe fire in the goblet had just turned red again.\\nSparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot\\nsuddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another\\npiece of parchment.\\nAutomatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a\\nlong hand and seized the parchment. He held it out\\nand stared at the name written upon it. There was a\\nlong pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the\\nslip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at\\nDumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat\\nand read out —\\n“ Harry Potter.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE FOUR CHAMPIONS\\nHarry sat there, aware that every head in the Great\\nHall had turned to look at him. He was stunned. He\\nfelt numb. He was surely dreaming. He had not heard\\ncorrectly.\\nThere was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry\\nbees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were\\nstanding up to get a better look at Harry as he sat,\\nfrozen, in his seat.\\nUp at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to\\nher feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor\\nKarkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor\\nDumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning\\nslightly.\\nHarry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he\\nsaw the long Gryffindor table all watching him,\\nopenmouthed.\\n“I didn’t put my name in,” Harry said blankly. “You\\nknow I didn’t.”\\n \\nBoth of them stared just as blankly back.\\nAt the top table, Professor Dumbledore had\\nstraightened up, nodding to Professor McGonagall.\\n“Harry Potter!” he called again. “Harry! Up here, if you\\nplease!”\\n“Go on,” Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight\\npush.\\nHarry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes,\\nand stumbled slightly. He set off up the gap between\\nthe Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It felt like an\\nimmensely long walk; the top table didn’t seem to be\\ngetting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds\\nand hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were\\na searchlight. The buzzing grew louder and louder.\\nAfter what seemed like an hour, he was right in front\\nof Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers\\nupon him.\\n“Well ... through the door, Harry,” said Dumbledore.\\nHe wasn’t smiling.\\nHarry moved off along the teachers’ table. Hagrid was\\nseated right at the end. He did not wink at Harry, or\\nwave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting. He\\nlooked completely astonished and stared at Harry as\\nhe passed like everyone else. Harry went through the\\ndoor out of the Great Hall and found himself in a\\nsmaller room, lined with paintings of witches and\\nwizards. A handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace\\nopposite him.\\nThe faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he\\nentered. He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame\\nof her picture and into the one next to it, which\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ncontained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The\\nwizened witch started whispering in his ear.\\nViktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour\\nwere grouped around the fire. They looked strangely\\nimpressive, silhouetted against the flames. Krum,\\nhunched-up and brooding, was leaning against the\\nmantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Cedric\\nwas standing with his hands behind his back, staring\\ninto the fire. Fleur Delacour looked around when\\nHarry walked in and threw back her sheet of long,\\nsilvery hair.\\n“What is it?” she said. “Do zey want us back in ze\\nHall?”\\nShe thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry\\ndidn’t know how to explain what had just happened.\\nHe just stood there, looking at the three champions. It\\nstruck him how very tall all of them were.\\nThere was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and\\nLudo Bagman entered the room. He took Harry by the\\narm and led him forward.\\n“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm.\\n“Absolutely extraordinary! Gentlemen ... lady,” he\\nadded, approaching the fireside and addressing the\\nother three. “May I introduce — incredible though it\\nmay seem — the fourth Triwizard champion?”\\nViktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened\\nas he surveyed Harry. Cedric looked nonplussed. He\\nlooked from Bagman to Harry and back again as\\nthough sure he must have misheard what Bagman\\nhad said. Fleur Delacour, however, tossed her hair,\\nsmiling, and said, “Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester\\nBagman.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered. “No, no, not at\\nall! Harry’s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire!”\\nKrum’s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was\\nstill looking politely bewildered. Fleur frowned.\\n“But evidently zair ’as been a mistake,” she said\\ncontemptuously to Bagman. “ ’E cannot compete. ’E is\\ntoo young.”\\n“Well ... it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his\\nsmooth chin and smiling down at Harry. “But, as you\\nknow, the age restriction was only imposed this year\\nas an extra safety measure. And as his name’s come\\nout of the goblet ... I mean, I don’t think there can be\\nany ducking out at this stage. ... It’s down in the\\nrules, you’re obliged ... Harry will just have to do the\\nbest he — ”\\nThe door behind them opened again, and a large\\ngroup of people came in: Professor Dumbledore,\\nfollowed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff,\\nMadame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and\\nProfessor Snape. Harry heard the buzzing of the\\nhundreds of students on the other side of the wall,\\nbefore Professor McGonagall closed the door.\\n“Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once, striding over to\\nher headmistress. “Zey are saying zat zis little boy is\\nto compete also!”\\nSomewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a\\nripple of anger. Little boy ?\\nMadame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full,\\nand considerable, height. The top of her handsome\\nhead brushed the candle-filled chandelier, and her\\ngigantic black-satin bosom swelled.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?” she said\\nimperiously.\\n“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,”\\nsaid Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely\\nsmile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. “Two\\nHogwarts champions? I don’t remember anyone\\ntelling me the host school is allowed two champions\\n— or have I not read the rules carefully enough?”\\nHe gave a short and nasty laugh.\\n“C’est impossible,” said Madame Maxime, whose\\nenormous hand with its many superb opals was\\nresting upon Fleur’s shoulder. “ ’Ogwarts cannot ’ave\\ntwo champions. It is most injust.”\\n“We were under the impression that your Age Line\\nwould keep out younger contestants, Dumbledore,”\\nsaid Karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though\\nhis eyes were colder than ever. “Otherwise, we would,\\nof course, have brought along a wider selection of\\ncandidates from our own schools.”\\n“It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,” said Snape\\nsoftly. His black eyes were alight with malice. “Don’t\\ngo blaming Dumbledore for Potter’s determination to\\nbreak rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he\\narrived here — ”\\n“Thank you, Severus,” said Dumbledore firmly, and\\nSnape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted\\nmalevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair.\\nProfessor Dumbledore was now looking down at\\nHarry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern\\nthe expression of the eyes behind the half-moon\\nspectacles.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire,\\nHarry?” he asked calmly.\\n“No,” said Harry. He was very aware of everybody\\nwatching him closely. Snape made a soft noise of\\nimpatient disbelief in the shadows.\\n“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet\\nof Fire for you?” said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring\\nSnape.\\n“No,” said Harry vehemently.\\n“Ah, but of course ’e is lying!” cried Madame Maxime.\\nSnape was now shaking his head, his lip curling.\\n“He could not have crossed the Age Line,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall sharply. “I am sure we are all\\nagreed on that — ”\\n“Dumbly-dorr must ’ave made a mistake wiz ze line,”\\nsaid Madame Maxime, shrugging.\\n“It is possible, of course,” said Dumbledore politely\\n“Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not\\nmake a mistake!” said Professor McGonagall angrily.\\n“Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have crossed\\nthe line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore\\nbelieves that he did not persuade an older student to\\ndo it for him, I’m sure that should be good enough for\\neverybody else!”\\nShe shot a very angry look at Professor Snape.\\n“Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Bagman,” said Karkaroff, his voice\\nunctuous once more, “you are our — er — objective\\njudges. Surely you will agree that this is most\\nirregular?”\\n \\nBagman wiped his round, boyish face with his\\nhandkerchief and looked at Mr. Crouch, who was\\nstanding outside the circle of the firelight, his face\\nhalf hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the\\nhalf darkness making him look much older, giving\\nhim an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke,\\nhowever, it was in his usual curt voice.\\n“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly\\nthat those people whose names come out of the\\nGoblet of Fire are bound to compete in the\\ntournament.”\\n“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said\\nBagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and\\nMadame Maxime, as though the matter was now\\nclosed.\\n“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of\\nmy students,” said Karkaroff. He had dropped his\\nunctuous tone and his smile now. His face wore a\\nvery ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of\\nFire once more, and we will continue adding names\\nuntil each school has two champions. It’s only fair,\\nDumbledore.”\\n“But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said\\nBagman. “The Goblet of Fire’s just gone out — it won’t\\nreignite until the start of the next tournament — ”\\n“ — in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be\\ncompeting!” exploded Karkaroff. “After all our\\nmeetings and negotiations and compromises, I little\\nexpected something of this nature to occur! I have\\nhalf a mind to leave now!”\\n“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near\\nthe door. “You can’t leave your champion now. He’s\\ngot to compete. They’ve all got to compete. Binding\\n \\nmagical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient,\\neh?”\\nMoody had just entered the room. He limped toward\\nthe fire, and with every right step he took, there was a\\nloud clunk.\\n“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t\\nunderstand you, Moody.”\\nHarry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as\\nthough what Moody was saying was barely worth his\\nnotice, but his hands gave him away; they had balled\\nthemselves into fists.\\n“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple,\\nKarkaroff. Someone put Potter’s name in that goblet\\nknowing he’d have to compete if it came out.”\\n“Evidently, someone ’oo wished to give ’Ogwarts two\\nbites at ze apple!” said Madame Maxime.\\n“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff,\\nbowing to her. “I shall be lodging complaints with the\\nMinistry of Magic and the International Confederation\\nof Wizards — ”\\n“If anyone’s got reason to complain, it’s Potter,”\\ngrowled Moody, “but ... funny thing ... I don’t hear\\nhim saying a word. ...”\\n“Why should ’e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour,\\nstamping her foot. “ ’E ’as ze chance to compete, ’asn’t\\n’e? We ’ave all been ’oping to be chosen for weeks and\\nweeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons\\nin prize money — zis is a chance many would die for!”\\n“Maybe someone’s hoping Potter is going to die for it,”\\nsaid Moody, with the merest trace of a growl.\\n \\nAn extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo\\nBagman, who was looking very anxious indeed,\\nbounced nervously up and down on his feet and said,\\n“Moody, old man ... what a thing to say!”\\n“We all know Professor Moody considers the morning\\nwasted if he hasn’t discovered six plots to murder him\\nbefore lunchtime,” said Karkaroff loudly. “Apparently\\nhe is now teaching his students to fear assassination\\ntoo. An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark\\nArts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your\\nreasons.”\\n“Imagining things, am I?” growled Moody. “Seeing\\nthings, eh? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put\\nthe boy’s name in that goblet. ...”\\n“Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?” said Madame\\nMaxime, throwing up her huge hands.\\n“Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical\\nobject!” said Moody. “It would have needed an\\nexceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle\\nthat goblet into forgetting that only three schools\\ncompete in the tournament. ... I’m guessing they\\nsubmitted Potter’s name under a fourth school, to\\nmake sure he was the only one in his category. ...”\\n“You seem to have given this a great deal of thought,\\nMoody,” said Karkaroff coldly, “and a very ingenious\\ntheory it is — though of course, I heard you recently\\ngot it into your head that one of your birthday\\npresents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk\\negg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a\\ncarriage clock. So you’ll understand if we don’t take\\nyou entirely seriously. ...”\\n“There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to\\ntheir advantage,” Moody retorted in a menacing voice.\\n \\n“It’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do,\\nKarkaroff — as you ought to remember. ...”\\n“Alas tor!” said Dumbledore warningly. Harry\\nwondered for a moment whom he was speaking to,\\nbut then realized “Mad-Eye” could hardly be Moody’s\\nreal first name. Moody fell silent, though still\\nsurveying Karkaroff with satisfaction — Karkaroff’s\\nface was burning.\\n“How this situation arose, we do not know,” said\\nDumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the\\nroom. “It seems to me, however, that we have no\\nchoice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have\\nbeen chosen to compete in the Tournament. This,\\ntherefore, they will do. ...”\\n“Ah, but Dumbly-dorr — ”\\n“My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative,\\nI would be delighted to hear it.”\\nDumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not\\nspeak, she merely glared. She wasn’t the only one\\neither. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff livid; Bagman,\\nhowever, looked rather excited.\\n“Well, shall we crack on, then?” he said, rubbing his\\nhands together and smiling around the room. “Got to\\ngive our champions their instructions, haven’t we?\\nBarty, want to do the honors?”\\nMr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie.\\n“Yes,” he said, “instructions. Yes ... the first task ...”\\nHe moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry\\nthought he looked ill. There were dark shadows\\nbeneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his\\n \\nwrinkled skin that had not been there at the\\nQuidditch World Cup.\\n“The first task is designed to test your daring,” he told\\nHarry, Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, “so we are not going\\nto be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the\\nunknown is an important quality in a wizard . . . very\\nimportant. ...\\n“The first task will take place on November the\\ntwenty-fourth, in front of the other students and the\\npanel of judges.\\n“The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept\\nhelp of any kind from their teachers to complete the\\ntasks in the tournament. The champions will face the\\nfirst challenge armed only with their wands. They will\\nreceive information about the second task when the\\nfirst is over. Owing to the demanding and time-\\nconsuming nature of the tournament, the champions\\nare exempted from end-of-year tests.”\\nMr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.\\n“I think that’s all, is it, Albus?”\\n“I think so,” said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr.\\nCrouch with mild concern. “Are you sure you\\nwouldn’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?”\\n“No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,”\\nsaid Mr. Crouch. “It is a very busy, very difficult time\\nat the moment. ... I’ve left young Weatherby in\\ncharge. ... Very enthusiastic ... a little\\noverenthusiastic, if truth be told. ...”\\n“You’ll come and have a drink before you go, at\\nleast?” said Dumbledore.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Come on, Barty, I’m staying!” said Bagman brightly.\\n“It’s all happening at Hogwarts now, you know, much\\nmore exciting here than at the office!”\\n“I think not, Ludo,” said Crouch with a touch of his\\nold impatience.\\n“Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a\\nnightcap?” said Dumbledore.\\nBut Madame Maxime had already put her arm\\naround Fleur’s shoulders and was leading her swiftly\\nout of the room. Harry could hear them both talking\\nvery fast in French as they went off into the Great\\nHall. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too,\\nexited, though in silence.\\n“Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said\\nDumbledore, smiling at both of them. “I am sure\\nGryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with\\nyou, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this\\nexcellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and\\nnoise.”\\nHarry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left\\ntogether.\\nThe Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had\\nburned low, giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins\\nan eerie, flickering quality.\\n“So,” said Cedric, with a slight smile. “We’re playing\\nagainst each other again!”\\n“I s’pose,” said Harry. He really couldn’t think of\\nanything to say. The inside of his head seemed to be\\nin complete disarray, as though his brain had been\\nransacked.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“So ... tell me ...” said Cedric as they reached the\\nentrance hall, which was now lit only by torches in\\nthe absence of the Goblet of Fire. “How did you get\\nyour name in?”\\n“I didn’t,” said Harry, staring up at him. “I didn’t put\\nit in. I was telling the truth.”\\n“Ah ... okay,” said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric\\ndidn’t believe him. “Well ... see you, then.”\\nInstead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric\\nheaded for a door to its right. Harry stood listening to\\nhim going down the stone steps beyond it, then,\\nslowly, he started to climb the marble ones.\\nWas anyone except Ron and Hermione going to\\nbelieve him, or would they all think he’d put himself\\nin for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think\\nthat, when he was facing competitors who’d had three\\nyears’ more magical education than he had — when\\nhe was now facing tasks that not only sounded very\\ndangerous, but which were to be performed in front of\\nhundreds of people? Yes, he’d thought about it ... he’d\\nfantasized about it ... but it had been a joke, really,\\nan idle sort of dream ... he’d never really, seriously\\nconsidered entering. ...\\nBut someone else had considered it ... someone else\\nhad wanted him in the tournament, and had made\\nsure he was entered. Why? To give him a treat? He\\ndidn’t think so, somehow. ...\\nTo see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were\\nlikely to get their wish. ...\\nBut to get him killed?\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nWas Moody just being his usual paranoid self?\\nCouldn’t someone have put Harry’s name in the\\ngoblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really\\nwant him dead?\\nHarry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone\\nwanted him dead, someone had wanted him dead\\never since he had been a year old ... Lord Voldemort.\\nBut how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry’s\\nname got into the Goblet of Fire? Voldemort was\\nsupposed to be far away, in some distant country, in\\nhiding, alone ... feeble and powerless. ...\\nYet in that dream he had had, just before he had\\nawoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not\\nbeen alone ... he had been talking to Wormtail ...\\nplotting Harry’s murder. . . .\\nHarry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady\\nalready. He had barely noticed where his feet were\\ncarrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she\\nwas not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who\\nhad flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had\\njoined the champions downstairs was now sitting\\nsmugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed\\nthrough every picture lining seven staircases to reach\\nhere before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were\\nlooking down at him with the keenest interest.\\n“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady, “Violet’s just told\\nme everything. Who’s just been chosen as school\\nchampion, then?”\\n“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.\\n“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch\\nindignantly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady\\nsoothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to\\nlet Harry into the common room.\\nThe blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the\\nportrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next\\nthing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the\\ncommon room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and\\nwas facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom\\nwere screaming, applauding, and whistling.\\n“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred;\\nhe looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.\\n“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!”\\nroared George.\\n“I didn’t,” Harry said. “I don’t know how — ”\\nBut Angelina had now swooped down upon him; “Oh\\nif it couldn’t be me, at least it’s a Gryffindor — ”\\n“You’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last\\nQuidditch match, Harry!” shrieked Katie Bell, another\\nof the Gryffindor Chasers.\\n“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some — ”\\n“I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast — ”\\nBut nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry;\\nnobody wanted to hear that he hadn’t put his name in\\nthe goblet; not one single person seemed to have\\nnoticed that he wasn’t at all in the mood to celebrate.\\n... Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner\\nfrom somewhere, and he insisted on draping it\\naround Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn’t get away;\\nwhenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to\\nthe dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks,\\n \\nforcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and\\npeanuts into his hands. ... Everyone wanted to know\\nhow he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore’s\\nAge Line and managed to get his name into the\\ngoblet. ...\\n“I didn’t,” he said, over and over again, “I don’t know\\nhow it happened.”\\nBut for all the notice anyone took, he might just as\\nwell not have answered at all.\\n“I’m tired!” he bellowed finally, after nearly half an\\nhour. “No, seriously, George — I’m going to bed — ”\\nHe wanted more than anything to find Ron and\\nHermione, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them\\nseemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he\\nneeded to sleep, and almost flattening the little\\nCreevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at\\nthe foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake\\neveryone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as\\nhe could.\\nTo his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed\\nin the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed.\\nHe looked up when Harry slammed the door behind\\nhim.\\n“Where ’ve you been?” Harry said.\\n“Oh hello,” said Ron.\\nHe was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort\\nof grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was\\nstill wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee\\nhad tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it\\nwas knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without\\nmoving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.\\n \\n“So,” he said, when Harry had finally removed the\\nbanner and thrown it into a corner.\\n“Congratulations . ”\\n“What d’you mean, congratulations?” said Harry,\\nstaring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong\\nwith the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a\\ngrimace.\\n“Well ... no one else got across the Age Line,” said\\nRon. “Not even Fred and George. What did you use —\\nthe Invisibility Cloak?”\\n“The Invisibility Cloak wouldn’t have got me over that\\nline,” said Harry slowly.\\n“Oh right,” said Ron. “I thought you might’ve told me\\nif it was the cloak ... because it would’ve covered both\\nof us, wouldn’t it? But you found another way, did\\nyou?”\\n“Listen,” said Harry, “I didn’t put my name in that\\ngoblet. Someone else must’ve done it.”\\nRon raised his eyebrows.\\n“What would they do that for?”\\n“I dunno,” said Harry. He felt it would sound very\\nmelodramatic to say, “To kill me.”\\nRon’s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger\\nof disappearing into his hair.\\n“It’s okay, you know, you can tell me the truth,” he\\nsaid. “If you don’t want everyone else to know, fine,\\nbut I don’t know why you’re bothering to lie, you\\ndidn’t get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of\\nthe Fat Lady’s, that Violet, she’s already told us all\\n \\nDumbledore’s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons\\nprize money, eh? And you don’t have to do end-of-\\nyear tests either. ...”\\n“I didn’t put my name in that goblet!” said Harry,\\nstarting to feel angry.\\n“Yeah, okay,” said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical\\ntone as Cedric. “Only you said this morning you’d\\nhave done it last night, and no one would’ve seen you.\\n... I’m not stupid, you know.”\\n“You’re doing a really good impression of it,” Harry\\nsnapped.\\n“Yeah?” said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin,\\nforced or otherwise, on his face now. “You want to get\\nto bed, Harry. I expect you’ll need to be up early\\ntomorrow for a photo-call or something.”\\nHe wrenched the hangings shut around his four-\\nposter, leaving Harry standing there by the door,\\nstaring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding\\none of the few people he had been sure would believe\\nhim.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS\\nWhen Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him\\na moment to remember why he felt so miserable and\\nworried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled\\nover him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of\\nhis own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force\\nRon to believe him — only to find that Ron’s bed was\\nempty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.\\nHarry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into\\nthe common room. The moment he appeared, the\\npeople who had already finished breakfast broke into\\napplause again. The prospect of going down into the\\nGreat Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all\\ntreating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting;\\nit was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to\\nbe cornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both\\nbeckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked\\nresolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open,\\nclimbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with\\nHermione.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Hello,” she said, holding up a stack of toast, which\\nshe was carrying in a napkin. “I brought you this. ...\\nWant to go for a walk?”\\n“Good idea,” said Harry gratefully.\\nThey went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall\\nquickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were\\nsoon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where\\nthe Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in\\nthe water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept\\nmoving, munching their toast, as Harry told\\nHermione exactly what had happened after he had left\\nthe Gryffindor table the night before. To his immense\\nrelief, Hermione accepted his story without question.\\n“Well, of course I knew you hadn’t entered yourself,”\\nshe said when he’d finished telling her about the\\nscene in the chamber off the Hall. “The look on your\\nface when Dumbledore read out your name! But the\\nquestion is, who did put it in? Because Moody’s right,\\nHarry ... I don’t think any student could have done it\\n... they’d never be able to fool the Goblet, or get over\\nDumbledore ’s — ”\\n“Have you seen Ron?” Harry interrupted.\\nHermione hesitated.\\n“Erm ... yes ... he was at breakfast,” she said.\\n“Does he still think I entered myself?”\\n“Well ... no, I don’t think so ... not really,” said\\nHermione awkwardly.\\n“What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Oh Harry, isn’t it obvious?” Hermione said\\ndespairingly. “He’s jealous!”\\n“Jealous?” Harry said incredulously. “Jealous of\\nwhat? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of\\nthe whole school, does he?”\\n“Look,” said Hermione patiently, “it’s always you who\\ngets all the attention, you know it is. I know it’s not\\nyour fault,” she added quickly, seeing Harry open his\\nmouth furiously. “I know you don’t ask for it ... but —\\nwell — you know, Ron’s got all those brothers to\\ncompete against at home, and you’re his best friend,\\nand you’re really famous — he’s always shunted to\\none side whenever people see you, and he puts up\\nwith it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose this\\nis just one time too many. ...”\\n“Great,” said Harry bitterly. “Really great.

People gawping at my\\nforehead everywhere I go. ...”\\n“I’m not telling him anything,” Hermione said shortly.\\n“Tell him yourself. It’s the only way to sort this out.”\\n“I’m not running around after him trying to make him\\ngrow up!” Harry said, so loudly that several owls in a\\nnearby tree took flight in alarm. “Maybe he’ll believe\\nI’m not enjoying myself once I’ve got my neck broken\\nor — ”\\n“That’s not funny,” said Hermione quietly. “That’s not\\nfunny at all.” She looked extremely anxious. “Harry,\\nI’ve been thinking — you know what we’ve got to do,\\ndon’t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to\\nthe castle?”\\n“Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the — ”\\n \\n“Write to Sirius. You’ve got to tell him what’s\\nhappened. He asked you to keep him posted on\\neverything that’s going on at Hogwarts. ... It’s almost\\nas if he expected something like this to happen. I\\nbrought some parchment and a quill out with me — ”\\n“Come off it,” said Harry, looking around to check\\nthat they couldn’t be overheard, but the grounds were\\nquite deserted. “He came back to the country just\\nbecause my scar twinged. He’ll probably come\\nbursting right into the castle if I tell him someone’s\\nentered me in the Triwizard Tournament — ”\\n“He’d want you to tell him,” said Hermione sternly.\\n“He’s going to find out anyway — ”\\n“How?”\\n“Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said\\nHermione, very seriously. “This tournament’s famous,\\nand you’re famous. Ill be really surprised if there isn’t\\nanything in the Daily Prophet about you competing. . . .\\nYou’re already in half the books about You-Know-\\nWho, you know ... and Sirius would rather hear it\\nfrom you, I know he would.”\\n“Okay, okay, I’ll write to him,” said Harry, throwing\\nhis last piece of toast into the lake. They both stood\\nand watched it floating there for a moment, before a\\nlarge tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it\\nbeneath the surface. Then they returned to the castle.\\n“Whose owl am I going to use?” Harry said as they\\nclimbed the stairs. “He told me not to use Hedwig\\nagain.”\\n“Ask Ron if you can borrow — ”\\n“I’m not asking Ron for anything,” Harry said flatly.\\n \\n“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone\\ncan use them,” said Hermione.\\nThey went up to the Owlery Hermione gave Harry a\\npiece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then\\nstrolled around the long lines of perches, looking at\\nall the different owls, while Harry sat down against a\\nwall and wrote his letter.\\nDear Sirius,\\nYou told me to keep you posted on what’s happening\\nat Hogwarts, so here goes — I don’t know if you’ve\\nheard, but the Tri-wizard Tournament’s happening this\\nyear and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth\\nchampion. I don’t know who put my name in the Goblet\\nof Fire, because I didn’t The other Hogwarts champion\\nis Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff\\nHe paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to\\nsay something about the large weight of anxiety that\\nseemed to have settled inside his chest since last\\nnight, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into\\nwords, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink\\nbottle and wrote,\\nHope you’re okay, and Buckbeak — Harry\\n“Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and\\nbrushing straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig came\\nfluttering down onto his shoulder and held out her\\nleg.\\n“I can’t use you,” Harry told her, looking around for\\nthe school owls. “I’ve got to use one of these. ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly\\nthat her talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her\\nback to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to\\nthe leg of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had\\nflown off, Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she\\nclicked her beak furiously and soared up into the\\nrafters out of reach.\\n“First Ron, then you,” said Harry angrily. “ This isn’t\\nmy fault.”\\nIf Harry had thought that matters would improve\\nonce everyone got used to the idea of him being\\nchampion, the following day showed him how\\nmistaken he was. He could no longer avoid the rest of\\nthe school once he was back at lessons — and it was\\nclear that the rest of the school, just like the\\nGryffindors, thought Harry had entered himself for\\nthe tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors, however,\\nthey did not seem impressed.\\nThe Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms\\nwith the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold\\ntoward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson\\nwas enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the\\nHufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their\\nchampion’s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by\\nthe fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any\\nglory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had\\never given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at\\nQuidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-\\nFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well,\\ndid not talk to him even though they were repotting\\nBouncing Bulbs at the same tray — though they did\\nlaugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing\\nBulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip and smacked\\nhim hard in the face. Ron wasn’t talking to Harry\\neither. Hermione sat between them, making very\\nforced conversation, but though both answered her\\n \\nnormally, they avoided making eye contact with each\\nother. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed\\ndistant with him — but then, she was Head of\\nHufflepuff House.\\nHe would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid\\nunder normal circumstances, but Care of Magical\\nCreatures meant seeing the Slytherins too — the first\\ntime he would come face-to-face with them since\\nbecoming champion.\\nPredictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid ’s cabin with his\\nfamiliar sneer firmly in place.\\n“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe\\nand Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry.\\n“Got your autograph books? Better get a signature\\nnow, because I doubt he’s going to be around much\\nlonger. ... Half the Triwizard champions have died ...\\nhow long d’you reckon you’re going to last, Potter?\\nTen minutes into the first task’s my bet.”\\nCrabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but\\nMalfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged\\nfrom the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower\\nof crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended\\nSkrewt. To the class’s horror, Hagrid proceeded to\\nexplain that the reason the skrewts had been killing\\none another was an excess of pent-up energy, and\\nthat the solution would be for each student to fix a\\nleash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The\\nonly good thing about this plan was that it distracted\\nMalfoy completely.\\n“Take this thing for a walk?” he repeated in disgust,\\nstaring into one of the boxes. “And where exactly are\\nwe supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the\\nblasting end, or the sucker?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Roun’ the middle,” said Hagrid, demonstrating. “Er\\n— yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves,\\njus’ as an extra precaution, like. Harry — you come\\nhere an’ help me with this big one. ...”\\nHagrid’s real intention, however, was to talk to Harry\\naway from the rest of the class. He waited until\\neveryone else had set off with their skrewts, then\\nturned to Harry and said, very seriously, “So — yer\\ncompetin’, Harry. In the tournament. School\\nchampion.”\\n“One of the champions,” Harry corrected him.\\nHagrid’s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under\\nhis wild eyebrows.\\n“No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?”\\n“You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said Harry,\\nconcealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt\\nat Hagrid’s words.\\n“ ’Course I do,” Hagrid grunted. “Yeh say it wasn’ you,\\nan’ I believe yeh — an’ Dumbledore believes yer, an’\\nall.”\\n“Wish I knew who did do it,” said Harry bitterly.\\nThe pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class\\nwas widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty.\\nThe skrewts were now over three feet long, and\\nextremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colorless,\\nthey had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny\\narmor. They looked like a cross between giant\\nscorpions and elongated crabs — but still without\\nrecognizable heads or eyes. They had become\\nimmensely strong and very hard to control.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Look like they’re havin’ fun, don’ they?” Hagrid said\\nhappily. Harry assumed he was talking about the\\nskrewts, because his classmates certainly weren’t;\\nevery now and then, with an alarming bang, one of\\nthe skrewts’ ends would explode, causing it to shoot\\nforward several yards, and more than one person was\\nbeing dragged along on their stomach, trying\\ndesperately to get back on their feet.\\n“Ah, I don’ know, Harry,” Hagrid sighed suddenly,\\nlooking back down at him with a worried expression\\non his face. “School champion ... everythin’ seems ter\\nhappen ter you, doesn’ it?”\\nHarry didn’t answer. Yes, everything did seem to\\nhappen to him ... that was more or less what\\nHermione had said as they had walked around the\\nlake, and that was the reason, according to her, that\\nRon was no longer talking to him.\\nThe next few days were some of Harry’s worst at\\nHogwarts. The closest he had ever come to feeling like\\nthis had been during those months, in his second\\nyear, when a large part of the school had suspected\\nhim of attacking his fellow students. But Ron had\\nbeen on his side then. He thought he could have\\ncoped with the rest of the school’s behavior if he could\\njust have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn’t\\ngoing to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron\\ndidn’t want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike\\npouring in on him from all sides.\\nHe could understand the Hufflepuffs’ attitude, even if\\nhe didn’t like it; they had their own champion to\\nsupport. He expected nothing less than vicious\\ninsults from the Slytherins — he was highly\\nunpopular there and always had been, because he\\nhad helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at\\nQuidditch and in the Inter-House Championship. But\\n \\nhe had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in\\ntheir hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He\\nwas wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to\\nthink that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit\\nmore fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his\\nname.\\nThen there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of\\na champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally\\nhandsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray\\neyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more\\nadmiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum. Harry\\nactually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been\\nso keen to get Krum’s autograph begging Cedric to\\nsign their school bags one lunchtime.\\nMeanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig\\nwas refusing to come anywhere near him, Professor\\nTrelawney was predicting his death with even more\\ncertainty than usual, and he did so badly at\\nSummoning Charms in Professor Flitwick’s class that\\nhe was given extra homework — the only person to\\nget any, apart from Neville.\\n“It’s really not that difficult, Harry,” Hermione tried to\\nreassure him as they left Flitwick’s class — she had\\nbeen making objects zoom across the room to her all\\nlesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet\\nfor board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and\\nlunascopes. “You just weren’t concentrating properly\\n“Wonder why that was,” said Harry darkly as Cedric\\nDiggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of\\nsimpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as\\nthough he were a particularly large Blast-Ended\\nSkrewt. “Still — never mind, eh? Double Potions to\\nlook forward to this afternoon. ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nDouble Potions was always a horrible experience, but\\nthese days it was nothing short of torture. Being shut\\nin a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and\\nthe Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to\\npunish Harry as much as possible for daring to\\nbecome school champion, was about the most\\nunpleasant thing Harry could imagine. He had\\nalready struggled through one Friday’s worth, with\\nHermione sitting next to him intoning “ignore them,\\nignore them, ignore them” under her breath, and he\\ncouldn’t see why today should be any better.\\nWhen he and Hermione arrived at Snape ’s dungeon\\nafter lunch, they found the Slytherins waiting outside,\\neach and every one of them wearing a large badge on\\nthe front of his or her robes. For one wild moment\\nHarry thought they were S.P.E.W. badges — then he\\nsaw that they all bore the same message, in luminous\\nred letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit\\nunderground passage:\\nSupport CEDRIC DIGGORY —\\nThe REAL Hogwarts Champion\\n“Like them, Potter?” said Malfoy loudly as Harry\\napproached. “And this isn’t all they do — look!”\\nHe pressed his badge into his chest, and the message\\nupon it vanished, to be replaced by another one,\\nwhich glowed green:\\nPOTTER STINKS\\nThe Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them\\npressed their badges too, until the message POTTER\\nSTINKS was shining brightly all around Harry. He felt\\nthe heat rise in his face and neck.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Oh very funny,” Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy\\nParkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were\\nlaughing harder than anyone, “really witty.”\\nRon was standing against the wall with Dean and\\nSeamus. He wasn’t laughing, but he wasn’t sticking\\nup for Harry either.\\n“Want one, Granger?” said Malfoy, holding out a\\nbadge to Hermione. “I’ve got loads. But don’t touch\\nmy hand, now. I’ve just washed it, you see; don’t want\\na Mudblood sliming it up.”\\nSome of the anger Harry had been feeling for days\\nand days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest.\\nHe had reached for his wand before he’d thought\\nwhat he was doing. People all around them scrambled\\nout of the way, backing down the corridor.\\n“Harry!” Hermione said warningly.\\n“Go on, then, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly, drawing out\\nhis own wand. “Moody’s not here to look after you\\nnow — do it, if you’ve got the guts — ”\\nFor a split second, they looked into each other’s eyes,\\nthen, at exactly the same time, both acted.\\n“ FurnunculusV’ Harry yelled.\\n“ DensaugeoV’ screamed Malfoy.\\nJets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in\\nmidair, and ricocheted off at angles — Harry’s hit\\nGoyle in the face, and Malfoy’s hit Hermione. Goyle\\nbellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great\\nugly boils were springing up — Hermione, whimpering\\nin panic, was clutching her mouth.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Hermione!”\\nRon had hurried forward to see what was wrong with\\nher; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione ’s\\nhand away from her face. It wasn’t a pretty sight.\\nHermione ’s front teeth — already larger than average\\n— were now growing at an alarming rate; she was\\nlooking more and more like a beaver as her teeth\\nelongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin —\\npanic-stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified\\ncry.\\n“And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly\\nvoice.\\nSnape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give\\ntheir explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger\\nat Malfoy and said, “Explain.”\\n“Potter attacked me, sir — ”\\n“We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry\\nshouted.\\n“ — and he hit Goyle — look — ”\\nSnape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled\\nsomething that would have been at home in a book\\non poisonous fungi.\\n“Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly.\\n“Malfoy got Hermione!” Ron said. “Loo/d”\\nHe forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth — she\\nwas doing her best to hide them with her hands,\\nthough this was difficult as they had now grown down\\npast her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nSlytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles,\\npointing at Hermione from behind Snape ’s back.\\nSnape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no\\ndifference.”\\nHermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears,\\nshe turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up\\nthe corridor and out of sight.\\nIt was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron\\nstarted shouting at Snape at the same time; lucky\\ntheir voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for\\nin the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear\\nexactly what they were calling him. He got the gist,\\nhowever.\\n“Let’s see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points\\nfrom Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and\\nWeasley. Now get inside, or it’ll be a week’s worth of\\ndetentions.”\\nHarry’s ears were ringing. The injustice of it made\\nhim want to curse Snape into a thousand slimy\\npieces. He passed Snape, walked with Ron to the\\nback of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto\\nthe table. Ron was shaking with anger too — for a\\nmoment, it felt as though everything was back to\\nnormal between them, but then Ron turned and sat\\ndown with Dean and Seamus instead, leaving Harry\\nalone at his table. On the other side of the dungeon,\\nMalfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his\\nbadge, smirking. POTTER STINKS flashed once more\\nacross the room.\\nHarry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began,\\npicturing horrific things happening to him. ... If only\\nhe knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse ... he’d have\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nSnape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and\\ntwitching. ...\\n“Antidotes!” said Snape, looking around at them all,\\nhis cold black eyes glittering unpleasantly. “You\\nshould all have prepared your recipes now. I want you\\nto brew them carefully, and then, we will be selecting\\nsomeone on whom to test one. ...”\\nSnape’s eyes met Harry’s, and Harry knew what was\\ncoming. Snape was going to poison him. Harry\\nimagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to\\nthe front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape’s\\ngreasy head —\\nAnd then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on\\nHarry’s thoughts.\\nIt was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room,\\nbeaming at Harry, and walked up to Snape’s desk at\\nthe front of the room.\\n“Yes?” said Snape curtly.\\n“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take Harry Potter\\nupstairs.”\\nSnape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose\\nsmile faded from his eager face.\\n“Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said\\nSnape coldly. “He will come upstairs when this class\\nis finished.”\\nColin went pink.\\n“Sir — sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said\\nnervously. “All the champions have got to go, I think\\nthey want to take photographs. ...”\\n \\nHarry would have given anything he owned to have\\nstopped Colin saying those last few words. He\\nchanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring\\ndeterminedly at the ceiling.\\n“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped. “Potter, leave\\nyour things here, I want you back down here later to\\ntest your antidote.”\\n“Please, sir — he’s got to take his things with him,”\\nsqueaked Colin. “All the champions — ”\\n“Very well\\\\” said Snape. “Potter — take your bag and\\nget out of my sight!”\\nHarry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and\\nheaded for the door. As he walked through the\\nSlytherin desks, POTTER STINKS flashed at him from\\nevery direction.\\n“It’s amazing, isn’t it, Harry?” said Colin, starting to\\nspeak the moment Harry had closed the dungeon\\ndoor behind him. “Isn’t it, though? You being\\nchampion?”\\n“Yeah, really amazing,” said Harry heavily as they set\\noff toward the steps into the entrance hall. “What do\\nthey want photos for, Colin?”\\n“The Daily Prophet, I think!”\\n“Great,” said Harry dully. “Exactly what I need. More\\npublicity.”\\n“Good luck!” said Colin when they had reached the\\nright room. Harry knocked on the door and entered.\\nHe was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks\\nhad been pushed away to the back of the room,\\n \\nleaving a large space in the middle; three of them,\\nhowever, had been placed end-to-end in front of the\\nblackboard and covered with a long length of velvet.\\nFive chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered\\ndesks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them,\\ntalking to a witch Harry had never seen before, who\\nwas wearing magenta robes.\\nViktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as\\nusual and not talking to anybody. Cedric and Fleur\\nwere in conversation. Fleur looked a good deal\\nhappier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept\\nthrowing back her head so that her long silvery hair\\ncaught the light. A paunchy man, holding a large\\nblack camera that was smoking slightly, was\\nwatching Fleur out of the corner of his eye.\\nBagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and\\nbounded forward.\\n“Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come,\\nHarry, in you come ... nothing to worry about, it’s just\\nthe wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges\\nwill be here in a moment — ”\\n“Wand weighing?” Harry repeated nervously.\\n“We have to check that your wands are fully\\nfunctional, no problems, you know, as they’re your\\nmost important tools in the tasks ahead,” said\\nBagman. “The expert’s upstairs now with\\nDumbledore. And then there’s going to be a little\\nphoto shoot. This is Rita Skeeter,” he added,\\ngesturing toward the witch in magenta robes. “She’s\\ndoing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily\\nProphet ...”\\n“Maybe not that small, Ludo,” said Rita Skeeter, her\\neyes on Harry.\\n \\nHer hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls\\nthat contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face. She\\nwore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching\\nher crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails,\\npainted crimson.\\n“I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry\\nbefore we start?” she said to Bagman, but still gazing\\nfixedly at Harry. “The youngest champion, you know\\n... to add a bit of color?”\\n“Certainly!” cried Bagman. “That is — if Harry has no\\nobjection?”\\n“Er — ” said Harry.\\n“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her\\nscarlet-taloned fingers had Harry’s upper arm in a\\nsurprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him\\nout of the room again and opening a nearby door.\\n“We don’t want to be in there with all that noise,” she\\nsaid. “Let’s see ... ah, yes, this is nice and cozy.”\\nIt was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her.\\n“Come along, dear — that’s right — lovely,” said Rita\\nSkeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an\\nupturned bucket, pushing Harry down onto a\\ncardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them\\ninto darkness. “Let’s see now ...”\\nShe unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and\\npulled out a handful of candles, which she lit with a\\nwave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that\\nthey could see what they were doing.\\n“You won’t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes\\nQuill? It leaves me free to talk to you normally. ...”\\n \\n“A what?” said Harry.\\nRita Skeeter’s smile widened. Harry counted three\\ngold teeth. She reached again into her crocodile bag\\nand drew out a long acid-green quill and a roll of\\nparchment, which she stretched out between them on\\na crate of Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess\\nRemover. She put the tip of the green quill into her\\nmouth, sucked it for a moment with apparent relish,\\nthen placed it upright on the parchment, where it\\nstood balanced on its point, quivering slightly.\\n“Testing ... my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet\\nreporter.”\\nHarry looked down quickly at the quill. The moment\\nRita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started\\nto scribble, skidding across the parchment:\\nAttractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, whose\\nsavage quill has punctured many inflated reputations\\n“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped\\nthe top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and\\nstuffed it into her handbag. Now she leaned toward\\nHarry and said, “So, Harry ... what made you decide\\nto enter the Triwizard Tournament?”\\n“Er — ” said Harry again, but he was distracted by the\\nquill. Even though he wasn’t speaking, it was dashing\\nacross the parchment, and in its wake he could make\\nout a fresh sentence:\\nAn ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the\\notherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Ignore the quill, Harry,” said Rita Skeeter firmly.\\nReluctantly, Harry looked up at her instead. “Now —\\nwhy did you decide to enter the tournament, Harry?”\\n“I didn’t,” said Harry. “I don’t know how my name got\\ninto the Goblet of Fire. I didn’t put it in there.”\\nRita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow.\\n“Come now, Harry, there’s no need to be scared of\\ngetting into trouble. We all know you shouldn’t really\\nhave entered at all. But don’t worry about that. Our\\nreaders love a rebel.”\\n“But I didn’t enter,” Harry repeated. “I don’t know\\nwho — ”\\n“How do you feel about the tasks ahead?” said Rita\\nSkeeter. “Excited? Nervous?”\\n“I haven’t really thought ... yeah, nervous, I suppose,”\\nsaid Harry. His insides squirmed uncomfortably as he\\nspoke.\\n“Champions have died in the past, haven’t they?” said\\nRita Skeeter briskly. “Have you thought about that at\\nall?”\\n“Well ... they say it’s going to be a lot safer this year,”\\nsaid Harry.\\nThe quill whizzed across the parchment between\\nthem, back and forward as though it were skating.\\n“Of course, you’ve looked death in the face before,\\nhaven’t you?” said Rita Skeeter, watching him closely.\\n“How would you say that’s affected you?”\\n“Er,” said Harry, yet again.\\n \\n“Do you think that the trauma in your past might\\nhave made you keen to prove yourself? To live up to\\nyour name? Do you think that perhaps you were\\ntempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because\\n“I didn’t enter,” said Harry, starting to feel irritated.\\n“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita\\nSkeeter, talking over him.\\n“No,” said Harry.\\n“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were\\ncompeting in the Triwizard Tournament? Proud?\\nWorried? Angry?”\\nHarry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth\\nwas he to know how his parents would feel if they\\nwere alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching him\\nvery intently. Frowning, he avoided her gaze and\\nlooked down at words the quill had just written:\\nTears fill those startling green eyes as our\\nconversation turns to the parents he can barely\\nremember.\\n“I have NOT got tears in my eyes!” said Harry loudly.\\nBefore Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the\\nbroom cupboard was pulled open. Harry looked\\naround, blinking in the bright light. Albus\\nDumbledore stood there, looking down at both of\\nthem, squashed into the cupboard.\\n“ Dumbledorel” cried Rita Skeeter, with every\\nappearance of delight — but Harry noticed that her\\nquill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from\\nthe box of Magical Mess Remover, and Rita’s clawed\\n \\nfingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her\\ncrocodile-skin bag. “How are you?” she said, standing\\nup and holding out one of her large, mannish hands\\nto Dumbledore. “I hope you saw my piece over the\\nsummer about the International Confederation of\\nWizards’ Conference?”\\n“Enchantingly nasty,” said Dumbledore, his eyes\\ntwinkling. “I particularly enjoyed your description of\\nme as an obsolete dingbat.”\\nRita Skeeter didn’t look remotely abashed.\\n“I was just making the point that some of your ideas\\nare a little old-fashioned, Dumbledore, and that many\\nwizards in the street — ”\\n“I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the\\nrudeness, Rita,” said Dumbledore, with a courteous\\nbow and a smile, “but I’m afraid we will have to\\ndiscuss the matter later. The Weighing of the Wands\\nis about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our\\nchampions is hidden in a broom cupboard.”\\nVery glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry\\nhurried back into the room. The other champions\\nwere now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat\\ndown quickly next to Cedric, looking up at the velvet-\\ncovered table, where four of the five judges were now\\nsitting — Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr.\\nCrouch, and Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled\\nherself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip the\\nparchment out of her bag again, spread it on her\\nknee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and\\nplace it once more on the parchment.\\n“May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?” said Dumbledore,\\ntaking his place at the judges’ table and talking to the\\nchampions. “He will be checking your wands to\\n \\nensure that they are in good condition before the\\ntournament.”\\nHarry looked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw\\nan old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by\\nthe window. Harry had met Mr. Ollivander before —\\nhe was the wand-maker from whom Harry had\\nbought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon\\nAlley.\\n“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first,\\nplease?” said Mr. Ollivander, stepping into the empty\\nspace in the middle of the room.\\nFleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Ollivander and\\nhanded him her wand.\\n“Hmmm ...” he said.\\nHe twirled the wand between his long fingers like a\\nbaton and it emitted a number of pink and gold\\nsparks. Then he held it close to his eyes and\\nexamined it carefully.\\n“Yes,” he said quietly, “nine and a half inches ...\\ninflexible . . . rosewood . . . and containing . . . dear me\\n“An ’air from ze ’ead of a veela,” said Fleur. “One of\\nmy grandmuzzer’s.”\\nSo Fleur was part veela, thought Harry, making a\\nmental note to tell Ron . . . then he remembered that\\nRon wasn’t speaking to him.\\n“Yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, “yes, I’ve never used veela\\nhair myself, of course. I find it makes for rather\\ntemperamental wands . . . however, to each his own,\\nand if this suits you ...”\\n \\nMr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand,\\napparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he\\nmuttered, “ OrchideousV’ and a bunch of flowers burst\\nfrom the wand tip.\\n“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said\\nMr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing\\nthem to Fleur with her wand. “Mr. Diggory, you next.”\\nFleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he\\npassed her.\\n“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr.\\nOllivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric\\nhanded over his wand. “Yes, I remember it well.\\nContaining a single hair from the tail of a particularly\\nfine male unicorn . . . must have been seventeen\\nhands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked\\nhis tail. Twelve and a quarter inches ... ash ...\\npleasantly springy. It’s in fine condition. ... You treat\\nit regularly?”\\n“Polished it last night,” said Cedric, grinning.\\nHarry looked down at his own wand. He could see\\nfinger marks all over it. He gathered a fistful of robe\\nfrom his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously.\\nSeveral gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur\\nDelacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he\\ndesisted.\\nMr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings\\nacross the room from the tip of Cedric’s wand,\\npronounced himself satisfied, and then said, “Mr.\\nKrum, if you please.”\\nViktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered\\nand duck-footed, toward Mr. Ollivander. He thrust\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nout his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in\\nthe pockets of his robes.\\n“Hmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, “this is a Gregorovitch\\ncreation, unless I’m much mistaken? A fine wand-\\nmaker, though the styling is never quite what I . . .\\nhowever ...”\\nHe lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning\\nit over and over before his eyes.\\n“Yes . . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” he shot at\\nKrum, who nodded. “Rather thicker than one usually\\nsees . . . quite rigid . . . ten and a quarter inches . . .\\nAvis\\'.”\\nThe hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a\\nnumber of small, twittering birds flew out of the end\\nand through the open window into the watery\\nsunlight.\\n“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his\\nwand. “Which leaves ... Mr. Potter.”\\nHarry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr.\\nOllivander. He handed over his wand.\\n“Aaaah, yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, his pale eyes\\nsuddenly gleaming. “Yes, yes, yes. How well I\\nremember.”\\nHarry could remember too. He could remember it as\\nthough it had happened yesterday. . .\\nFour summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had\\nentered Mr. Ollivander’s shop with Hagrid to buy a\\nwand. Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements\\nand then started handing him wands to try. Harry\\nhad waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until\\n \\nat last he had found the one that suited him — this\\none, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and\\ncontained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix.\\nMr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry\\nhad been so compatible with this wand. “Curious,” he\\nhad said, “curious,” and not until Harry asked what\\nwas curious had Mr. Ollivander explained that the\\nphoenix feather in Harry’s wand had come from the\\nsame bird that had supplied the core of Lord\\nVoldemort’s.\\nHarry had never shared this piece of information with\\nanybody. He was very fond of his wand, and as far as\\nhe was concerned its relation to Voldemort’s wand\\nwas something it couldn’t help — rather as he\\ncouldn’t help being related to Aunt Petunia. However,\\nhe really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn’t about to\\ntell the room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita\\nSkeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with\\nexcitement if he did.\\nMr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry’s\\nwand than anyone else’s. Eventually, however, he\\nmade a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it\\nback to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect\\ncondition.\\n“Thank you all,” said Dumbledore, standing up at the\\njudges’ table. “You may go back to your lessons now\\n— or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to\\ndinner, as they are about to end — ”\\nFeeling that at last something had gone right today,\\nHarry got up to leave, but the man with the black\\ncamera jumped up and cleared his throat.\\n“Photos, Dumbledore, photos!” cried Bagman\\nexcitedly. “All the judges and champions, what do you\\nthink, Rita?”\\n \\n“Er — yes, let’s do those first,” said Rita Skeeter,\\nwhose eyes were upon Harry again. “And then\\nperhaps some individual shots.”\\nThe photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime\\ncast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood,\\nand the photographer couldn’t stand far enough back\\nto get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit\\nwhile everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept\\ntwirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra\\ncurl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would\\nhave been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half-\\nhidden, at the back of the group. The photographer\\nseemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita\\nSkeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry\\ninto greater prominence. Then she insisted on\\nseparate shots of all the champions. At last, they were\\nfree to go.\\nHarry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn’t there —\\nhe supposed she was still in the hospital wing having\\nher teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table,\\nthen returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the\\nextra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do.\\nUp in the dormitory, he came across Ron.\\n“You’ve had an owl,” said Ron brusquely the moment\\nhe walked in. He was pointing at Harry’s pillow. The\\nschool barn owl was waiting for him there.\\n“Oh — right,” said Harry.\\n“And we’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night,\\nSnape’s dungeon,” said Ron.\\nHe then walked straight out of the room, not looking\\nat Harry. For a moment, Harry considered going after\\nhim — he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to talk to\\nhim or hit him, both seemed quite appealing — but\\n \\nthe lure of Sirius’s answer was too strong. Harry\\nstrode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg,\\nand unrolled it.\\nHarry —\\nI can’t say everything I would like to in a letter, it’s too\\nrisky in case the owl is intercepted — we need to talk\\nface-to-face. Can you ensure that you are alone by the\\nfire in Gryffindor Tower at one o’clock in the morning\\non the 22nd of November?\\nI know better than anyone that you can look after\\nyourself and while you’re around Dumbledore and\\nMoody I don’t think anyone will be able to hurt you.\\nHowever, someone seems to be having a good try.\\nEntering you in that tournament would have been very\\nrisky, especially right under Dumbledore’ s nose.\\nBe on the watch, Harry. I still want to hear about\\nanything unusual. Let me know about the 22nd of\\nNovember as quickly as you can.\\nSirius\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL\\nThe prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all\\nthat sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only\\nbright spot on a horizon that had never looked\\ndarker. The shock of finding himself school champion\\nhad worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was\\nfacing him had started to sink in. The first task was\\ndrawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were\\ncrouching ahead of him like some horrific monster,\\nbarring his path. He had never suffered nerves like\\nthese; they were way beyond anything he had\\nexperienced before a Quidditch match, not even his\\nlast one against Slytherin, which had decided who\\nwould win the Quidditch Cup. Harry was finding it\\nhard to think about the future at all; he felt as though\\nhis whole life had been leading up to, and would\\nfinish with, the first task. ...\\nAdmittedly, he didn’t see how Sirius was going to\\nmake him feel any better about having to perform an\\nunknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in\\nfront of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a\\nfriendly face would be something at the moment.\\n \\nHarry wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be\\nbeside the common room fire at the time Sirius had\\nsuggested, and he and Hermione spent a long time\\ngoing over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the\\ncommon room on the night in question. If the worst\\ncame to the worst, they were going to drop a bag of\\nDungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn’t have to\\nresort to that — Filch would skin them alive.\\nIn the meantime, life became even worse for Harry\\nwithin the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had\\npublished her piece about the Triwizard Tournament,\\nand it had turned out to be not so much a report on\\nthe tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry.\\nMuch of the front page had been given over to a\\npicture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two,\\nsix, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names\\nof the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions\\n(misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of\\nthe article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.\\nThe article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still\\ngot a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach\\nevery time he thought about it. Rita Skeeter had\\nreported him saying an awful lot of things that he\\ncouldn’t remember ever saying in his life, let alone in\\nthat broom cupboard.\\nI suppose I get my strength from my parents. I know\\nthey’d be very proud of me if they could see me now.\\n... Yes, sometimes at night I still cry about them, I’m\\nnot ashamed to admit it. ... I know nothing will hurt\\nme during the tournament, because they’re watching\\nover me. ...\\nBut Rita Skeeter had gone even further than\\ntransforming his “er’s” into long, sickly sentences:\\nShe had interviewed other people about him too.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close\\nfriend, Colin Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen\\nout of the company of one Hermione Granger, a\\nstunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like Harry, is\\none of the top students in the school.\\nFrom the moment the article had appeared, Harry\\nhad had to endure people — Slytherins, mainly —\\nquoting it at him as he passed and making sneering\\ncomments.\\n“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in\\nTransfiguration?”\\n“Since when have you been one of the top students in\\nthe school, Potter? Or is this a school you and\\nLongbottom have set up together?”\\n“Hey — Harry!”\\n“Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as\\nhe wheeled around in the corridor, having had just\\nabout enough. “I’ve just been crying my eyes out over\\nmy dead mum, and I’m just off to do a bit more. ...”\\n“No — it was just — you dropped your quill.”\\nIt was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face.\\n“Oh — right — sorry,” he muttered, taking the quill\\nback.\\n“Er ... good luck on Tuesday,” she said. “I really hope\\nyou do well.”\\nWhich left Harry feeling extremely stupid.\\nHermione had come in for her fair share of\\nunpleasantness too, but she hadn’t yet started yelling\\n \\nat innocent bystanders; in fact, Harry was full of\\nadmiration for the way she was handling the\\nsituation.\\n“ Stunningly pretty? Her?” Pansy Parkinson had\\nshrieked the first time she had come face-to-face with\\nHermione after Rita’s article had appeared. “What was\\nshe judging against — a chipmunk?”\\n“Ignore it,” Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding\\nher head in the air and stalking past the sniggering\\nSlytherin girls as though she couldn’t hear them.\\n“Just ignore it, Harry.”\\nBut Harry couldn’t ignore it. Ron hadn’t spoken to\\nhim at all since he had told him about Snape’s\\ndetentions. Harry had half hoped they would make\\nthings up during the two hours they were forced to\\npickle rats’ brains in Snape’s dungeon, but that had\\nbeen the day Rita’s article had appeared, which\\nseemed to have confirmed Ron’s belief that Harry was\\nreally enjoying all the attention.\\nHermione was furious with the pair of them; she went\\nfrom one to the other, trying to force them to talk to\\neach other, but Harry was adamant: He would talk to\\nRon again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn’t put\\nhis name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for\\ncalling him a liar.\\n“I didn’t start this,” Harry said stubbornly. “It’s his\\nproblem.”\\n“You miss him!” Hermione said impatiently. “And I\\nknow he misses you — ”\\n“Miss him?” said Harry. “I don’t miss him. ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBut this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione\\nvery much, but she just wasn’t the same as Ron.\\nThere was much less laughter and a lot more hanging\\naround in the library when Hermione was your best\\nfriend. Harry still hadn’t mastered Summoning\\nCharms, he seemed to have developed something of a\\nblock about them, and Hermione insisted that\\nlearning the theory would help. They consequently\\nspent a lot of time poring over books during their\\nlunchtimes.\\nViktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and\\nHarry wondered what he was up to. Was he studying,\\nor was he looking for things to help him through the\\nfirst task? Hermione often complained about Krum\\nbeing there — not that he ever bothered them — but\\nbecause groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy\\non him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione\\nfound the noise distracting.\\n“He’s not even good-looking!” she muttered angrily,\\nglaring at Krum’s sharp profile. “They only like him\\nbecause he’s famous! They wouldn’t look twice at him\\nif he couldn’t do that Wonky- Faint thing — ”\\n“Wronski Feint,” said Harry, through gritted teeth.\\nQuite apart from liking to get Quidditch terms\\ncorrect, it caused him another pang to imagine Ron’s\\nexpression if he could have heard Hermione talking\\nabout Wonky- Faints.\\nIt is a strange thing, but when you are dreading\\nsomething, and would give anything to slow down\\ntime, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up. The\\ndays until the first task seemed to slip by as though\\nsomeone had fixed the clocks to work at double\\nspeed. Harry’s feeling of barely controlled panic was\\nwith him wherever he went, as everpresent as the\\nsnide comments about the Daily Prophet article.\\n \\nOn the Saturday before the first task, all students in\\nthe third year and above were permitted to visit the\\nvillage of Hogsmeade. Hermione told Harry that it\\nwould do him good to get away from the castle for a\\nbit, and Harry didn’t need much persuasion.\\n“What about Ron, though?” he said. “Don’t you want\\nto go with him?”\\n“Oh ... well ...” Hermione went slightly pink. “I\\nthought we might meet up with him in the Three\\nBroomsticks. ...”\\n“No,” said Harry flatly.\\n“Oh Harry, this is so stupid — ”\\n“I’ll come, but I’m not meeting Ron, and I’m wearing\\nmy Invisibility Cloak.”\\n“Oh all right then ...” Hermione snapped, “but I hate\\ntalking to you in that cloak, I never know if I’m\\nlooking at you or not.”\\nSo Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the\\ndormitory, went back downstairs, and together he\\nand Hermione set off for Hogsmeade.\\nHarry felt wonderfully free under the cloak; he\\nwatched other students walking past them as they\\nentered the village, most of them sporting Support\\nCedric Diggory\\\\ badges, but no horrible remarks came\\nhis way for a change, and nobody was quoting that\\nstupid article.\\n“People keep looking at me now,” said Hermione\\ngrumpily as they came out of Honeydukes Sweetshop\\nlater, eating large cream-filled chocolates. “They think\\nI’m talking to myself.”\\n \\n“Don’t move your lips so much then.”\\n“Come on, please just take off your cloak for a bit, no\\none’s going to bother you here.”\\n“Oh yeah?” said Harry. “Look behind you.”\\nRita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just\\nemerged from the Three Broomsticks pub. Talking in\\nlow voices, they passed right by Hermione without\\nlooking at her. Harry backed into the wall of\\nHoneydukes to stop Rita Skeeter from hitting him\\nwith her crocodile-skin handbag. When they were\\ngone, Harry said, “She’s staying in the village. I bet\\nshe’s coming to watch the first task.”\\nAs he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of\\nmolten panic. He didn’t mention this; he and\\nHermione hadn’t discussed what was coming in the\\nfirst task much; he had the feeling she didn’t want to\\nthink about it.\\n“She’s gone,” said Hermione, looking right through\\nHarry toward the end of the street. “Why don’t we go\\nand have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks, it’s a\\nbit cold, isn’t it? You don’t have to talk to Ron!” she\\nadded irritably, correctly interpreting his silence.\\nThe Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with\\nHogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but\\nalso with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw\\nanywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade\\nwas the only all-wizard village in Britain, it was a bit\\nof a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as\\nadept as wizards at disguising themselves.\\nIt was very hard to move through crowds in the\\nInvisibility Cloak, in case you accidentally trod on\\nsomeone, which tended to lead to awkward questions.\\n \\nHarry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner\\nwhile Hermione went to buy drinks. On his way\\nthrough the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting\\nwith Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge\\nto give Ron a good hard poke in the back of the head,\\nhe finally reached the table and sat down at it.\\nHermione joined him a moment later and slipped him\\na butterbeer under his cloak.\\n“I look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own,” she\\nmuttered. “Lucky I brought something to do.”\\nAnd she pulled out a notebook in which she had been\\nkeeping a record of S.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his\\nand Ron’s names at the top of the very short list. It\\nseemed a long time ago that they had sat making up\\nthose predictions together, and Hermione had turned\\nup and appointed them secretary and treasurer.\\n“You know, maybe I should try and get some of the\\nvillagers involved in S.P.E.W.,” Hermione said\\nthoughtfully, looking around the pub.\\n“Yeah, right,” said Harry. He took a swig of butterbeer\\nunder his cloak. “Hermione, when are you going to\\ngive up on this spew stuff?”\\n“When house-elves have decent wages and working\\nconditions!” she hissed back. “You know, I’m starting\\nto think it’s time for more direct action. I wonder how\\nyou get into the school kitchens?”\\n“No idea, ask Fred and George,” said Harry.\\nHermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry\\ndrank his butterbeer, watching the people in the pub.\\nAll of them looked cheerful and relaxed. Ernie\\nMacmillan and Hannah Abbott were swapping\\n \\nChocolate Frog cards at a nearby table; both of them\\nsporting Support Cedric Diggory\\\\ badges on their\\ncloaks. Right over by the door he saw Cho and a large\\ngroup of her Ravenclaw friends. She wasn’t wearing a\\nCedric badge though. ... This cheered up Harry very\\nslightly. ...\\nWhat wouldn’t he have given to be one of these\\npeople, sitting around laughing and talking, with\\nnothing to worry about but homework? He imagined\\nhow it would have felt to be here if his name hadn’t\\ncome out of the Goblet of Fire. He wouldn’t be wearing\\nthe Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be\\nsitting with him. The three of them would probably be\\nhappily imagining what deadly dangerous task the\\nschool champions would be facing on Tuesday. He’d\\nhave been really looking forward to it, watching them\\ndo whatever it was . . . cheering on Cedric with\\neveryone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands.\\nHe wondered how the other champions were feeling.\\nEvery time he had seen Cedric lately, he had been\\nsurrounded by admirers and looking nervous but\\nexcited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to\\ntime in the corridors; she looked exactly as she\\nalways did, haughty and unruffled. And Krum just\\nsat in the library, poring over books.\\nHarry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in\\nhis chest seemed to ease slightly. He would be\\nspeaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight\\nwas the night they were meeting at the common room\\nfire — assuming nothing went wrong, as everything\\nelse had done lately. ...\\n“Look, it’s Hagrid!” said Hermione.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThe back of Hagrid ’s enormous shaggy head — he\\nhad mercifully abandoned his bunches — emerged\\nover the crowd. Harry wondered why he hadn’t\\nspotted him at once, as Hagrid was so large, but\\nstanding up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been\\nleaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had\\nhis usual enormous tankard in front of him, but\\nMoody was drinking from his hip flask. Madam\\nRosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn’t seem to think\\nmuch of this; she was looking askance at Moody as\\nshe collected glasses from tables around them.\\nPerhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled\\nmead, but Harry knew better. Moody had told them\\nall during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts\\nlesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and\\ndrink at all times, as it was so easy for Dark wizards\\nto poison an unattended cup.\\nAs Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up\\nto leave. He waved, then remembered that Hagrid\\ncouldn’t see him. Moody, however, paused, his\\nmagical eye on the corner where Harry was standing.\\nHe tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being\\nunable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to\\nhim, and then the pair of them made their way back\\nacross the pub toward Harry and Hermione’s table.\\n“All right, Hermione?” said Hagrid loudly.\\n“Hello,” said Hermione, smiling back.\\nMoody limped around the table and bent down; Harry\\nthought he was reading the S.P.E.W. notebook, until\\nhe muttered, “Nice cloak, Potter.”\\nHarry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk\\nmissing from Moody’s nose was particularly obvious\\nat a few inches’ distance. Moody grinned.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Can your eye — I mean, can you — ?”\\n“Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,” Moody\\nsaid quietly. “And it’s come in useful at times, I can\\ntell you.”\\nHagrid was beaming down at Harry too. Harry knew\\nHagrid couldn’t see him, but Moody had obviously\\ntold Hagrid he was there. Hagrid now bent down on\\nthe pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well,\\nand said in a whisper so low that only Harry could\\nhear it, “Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me\\ncabin. Wear that cloak.”\\nStraightening up, Hagrid said loudly, “Nice ter see\\nyeh, Hermione,” winked, and departed. Moody\\nfollowed him.\\n“Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?”\\nHarry said, very surprised.\\n“Does he?” said Hermione, looking startled. “I wonder\\nwhat he’s up to? I don’t know whether you should go,\\nHarry. ...” She looked nervously around and hissed,\\n“It might make you late for Sirius.”\\nIt was true that going down to Hagrid ’s at midnight\\nwould mean cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine\\nindeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down to\\nHagrid ’s to tell him he couldn’t go — always assuming\\nshe would consent to take the note, of course —\\nHarry, however, thought it better just to be quick at\\nwhatever Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious\\nto know what this might be; Hagrid had never asked\\nHarry to visit him so late at night.\\nAt half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had\\npretended to go up to bed early, pulled the Invisibility\\nCloak back over himself and crept back downstairs\\n \\nthrough the common room. Quite a few people were\\nstill in there. The Creevey brothers had managed to\\nget hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggoryl badges\\nand were trying to bewitch them to make them say\\nSupport Harry Potter\\\\ instead. So far, however, all they\\nhad managed to do was get the badges stuck on\\nPOTTER STINKS. Harry crept past them to the portrait\\nhole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on\\nhis watch. Then Hermione opened the Fat Lady for\\nhim from outside as they had planned. He slipped\\npast her with a whispered “Thanks!” and set off\\nthrough the castle.\\nThe grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the\\nlawn toward the lights shining in Hagrid’s cabin. The\\ninside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was\\nalso lit up; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking\\ninside it as he knocked on Hagrid’s front door.\\n“You there, Harry?” Hagrid whispered, opening the\\ndoor and looking around.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and\\npulling the cloak down off his head. “What’s up?”\\n“Got summat ter show yeh,” said Hagrid.\\nThere was an air of enormous excitement about\\nHagrid. He was wearing a flower that resembled an\\noversized artichoke in his buttonhole. It looked as\\nthough he had abandoned the use of axle grease, but\\nhe had certainly attempted to comb his hair — Harry\\ncould see the comb’s broken teeth tangled in it.\\n“What’re you showing me?” Harry said warily,\\nwondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or Hagrid had\\nmanaged to buy another giant three-headed dog off a\\nstranger in a pub.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Come with me, keep quiet, an’ keep yerself covered\\nwith that cloak,” said Hagrid. “We won’ take Fang, he\\nwon’ like it. ...”\\n“Listen, Hagrid, I can’t stay long. ... I’ve got to be back\\nup at the castle by one o’clock — ”\\nBut Hagrid wasn’t listening; he was opening the cabin\\ndoor and striding off into the night. Harry hurried to\\nfollow and found, to his great surprise, that Hagrid\\nwas leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.\\n“Hagrid, what — ?”\\n“Shhh!” said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on\\nthe door bearing the crossed golden wands.\\nMadame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk\\nshawl wrapped around her massive shoulders. She\\nsmiled when she saw Hagrid.\\n“Ah, ’Agrid ... it is time?”\\n“Bong-sewer,” said Hagrid, beaming at her, and\\nholding out a hand to help her down the golden steps.\\nMadame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid\\noffered her his arm, and they set off around the edge\\nof the paddock containing Madame Maxime ’s giant\\nwinged horses, with Harry, totally bewildered,\\nrunning to keep up with them. Had Hagrid wanted to\\nshow him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old\\ntime he wanted ... she wasn’t exactly hard to miss. ...\\nBut it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the\\nsame treat as Harry, because after a while she said\\nplayfully, “Wair is it you are taking me, ’Agrid?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said Hagrid gruffly, “worth seem’,\\ntrust me. On’y — don’ go tellin’ anyone I showed yeh,\\nright? Yeh’re not s’posed ter know.”\\n“Of course not,” said Madame Maxime, fluttering her\\nlong black eyelashes.\\nAnd still they walked, Harry getting more and more\\nirritated as he jogged along in their wake, checking\\nhis watch every now and then. Hagrid had some\\nharebrained scheme in hand, which might make him\\nmiss Sirius. If they didn’t get there soon, he was going\\nto turn around, go straight back to the castle, and\\nleave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame\\nMaxime. ...\\nBut then — when they had walked so far around the\\nperimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake\\nwere out of sight — Harry heard something. Men were\\nshouting up ahead . . . then came a deafening,\\nearsplitting roar. . . .\\nHagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees\\nand came to a halt. Harry hurried up alongside them\\n— for a split second, he thought he was seeing\\nbonfires, and men darting around them — and then\\nhis mouth fell open.\\nDragons.\\nFour fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons\\nwere rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure\\nfenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and\\nsnorting — torrents of fire were shooting into the dark\\nsky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above\\nthe ground on their outstretched necks. There was a\\nsilvery-blue one with long, pointed horns, snapping\\nand snarling at the wizards on the ground; a smooth-\\nscaled green one, which was writhing and stamping\\n \\nwith all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine\\ngold spikes around its face, which was shooting\\nmushroom-shaped fire clouds into the air; and a\\ngigantic black one, more lizard-like than the others,\\nwhich was nearest to them.\\nAt least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon,\\nwere attempting to control them, pulling on the\\nchains connected to heavy leather straps around their\\nnecks and legs. Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high\\nabove him, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with\\nvertical pupils like a cat’s, bulging with either fear or\\nrage, he couldn’t tell which. ... It was making a\\nhorrible noise, a yowling, screeching scream. ...\\n“Keep back there, Hagrid!” yelled a wizard near the\\nfence, straining on the chain he was holding. “They\\ncan shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you know! I’ve\\nseen this Horntail do forty!”\\n“Is’n’ it beautiful?” said Hagrid softly.\\n“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard. “Stunning\\nSpells, on the count of three!”\\nHarry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his\\nwand.\\n“Stupefy\\\\” they shouted in unison, and the Stunning\\nSpells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets,\\nbursting in showers of stars on the dragons’ scaly\\nhides —\\nHarry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter\\ndangerously on its back legs; its jaws stretched wide\\nin a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of\\nflame, though still smoking — then, very slowly, it\\nfell. Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nground with a thud that Harry could have sworn\\nmade the trees behind him quake.\\nThe dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked\\nforward to their fallen charges, each of which was the\\nsize of a small hill. They hurried to tighten the chains\\nand fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they\\nforced deep into the ground with their wands.\\n“Wan’ a closer look?” Hagrid asked Madame Maxime\\nexcitedly. The pair of them moved right up to the\\nfence, and Harry followed. The wizard who had\\nwarned Hagrid not to come any closer turned, and\\nHarry realized who it was: Charlie Weasley.\\n“All right, Hagrid?” he panted, coming over to talk.\\n“They should be okay now — we put them out with a\\nSleeping Draft on the way here, thought it might be\\nbetter for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet\\n— but, like you saw, they weren’t happy, not happy at\\nall — ”\\n“What breeds you got here, Charlie?” said Hagrid,\\ngazing at the closest dragon, the black one, with\\nsomething close to reverence. Its eyes were still just\\nopen. Harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow\\nbeneath its wrinkled black eyelid.\\n“This is a Hungarian Horntail,” said Charlie. “There’s\\na Common Welsh Green over there, the smaller one —\\na Swedish Short-Snout, that blue-gray — and a\\nChinese Fireball, that’s the red.”\\nCharlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling\\naway around the edge of the enclosure, gazing at the\\nstunned dragons.\\n“I didn’t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,” Charlie\\nsaid, frowning. “The champions aren’t supposed to\\n \\nknow what’s coming — she’s bound to tell her\\nstudent, isn’t she?”\\n“Jus’ thought she’d like ter see ’em,” shrugged Hagrid,\\nstill gazing, enraptured, at the dragons.\\n“Really romantic date, Hagrid,” said Charlie, shaking\\nhis head.\\n“Four ...” said Hagrid, “so it’s one fer each o’ the\\nchampions, is it? What’ve they gotta do — fight ’em?”\\n“Just get past them, I think,” said Charlie. “We’ll be\\non hand if it gets nasty, Extinguishing Spells at the\\nready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don’t know\\nwhy ... but I tell you this, I don’t envy the one who\\ngets the Horntail. Vicious thing. Its back end’s as\\ndangerous as its front, look.”\\nCharlie pointed toward the Horntail’s tail, and Harry\\nsaw long, bronze-colored spikes protruding along it\\nevery few inches.\\nFive of Charlie’s fellow keepers staggered up to the\\nHorntail at that moment, carrying a clutch of huge\\ngranite-gray eggs between them in a blanket. They\\nplaced them carefully at the Horntail’s side. Hagrid let\\nout a moan of longing.\\n“I’ve got them counted, Hagrid,” said Charlie sternly.\\nThen he said, “How’s Harry?”\\n“Fine,” said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.\\n“Just hope he’s still fine after he’s faced this lot,” said\\nCharlie grimly, looking out over the dragons’\\nenclosure. “I didn’t dare tell Mum what he’s got to do\\nfor the first task; she’s already having kittens about\\nhim. ...” Charlie imitated his mother’s anxious voice. “\\n \\n‘ How could they let him enter that tournament, he’s\\nmuch too young\\\\ I thought they were all safe, I thought\\nthere was going to he an age limiti ’ She was in floods\\nafter that Daily Prophet article about him. ‘He still\\ncries about his parents\\\\ Oh bless him, I never knew\\\\ ’ ”\\nHarry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that\\nHagrid wouldn’t miss him, with the attractions of four\\ndragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he\\nturned silently and began to walk away, back to the\\ncastle.\\nHe didn’t know whether he was glad he’d seen what\\nwas coming or not. Perhaps this way was better. The\\nfirst shock was over now. Maybe if he’d seen the\\ndragons for the first time on Tuesday, he would have\\npassed out cold in front of the whole school ... but\\nmaybe he would anyway. ... He was going to be armed\\nwith his wand — which, just now, felt like nothing\\nmore than a narrow strip of wood — against a fifty-\\nfoot-high, scaly, spike-ridden, fire-breathing dragon.\\nAnd he had to get past it. With everyone watching.\\nHow?\\nHarry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had\\njust under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside\\nand talk to Sirius, and he couldn’t remember, ever,\\nwanting to talk to someone more than he did right\\nnow — when, without warning, he ran into something\\nvery solid.\\nHarry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the\\ncloak around him. A voice nearby said, “Ouch! Who’s\\nthere?”\\nHarry hastily checked that the cloak was covering\\nhim and lay very still, staring up at the dark outline\\nof the wizard he had hit. He recognized the goatee ...\\nit was Karkaroff.\\n \\n“Who’s there?” said Karkaroff again, very\\nsuspiciously, looking around in the darkness. Harry\\nremained still and silent. After a minute or so,\\nKarkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort\\nof animal; he was looking around at waist height, as\\nthough expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back\\nunder the cover of the trees and started to edge\\nforward toward the place where the dragons were.\\nVery slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet\\nand set off again as fast as he could without making\\ntoo much noise, hurrying through the darkness back\\ntoward Hogwarts.\\nHe had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up\\nto. He had sneaked off his ship to try and find out\\nwhat the first task was going to be. He might even\\nhave spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off\\naround the forest together — they were hardly\\ndifficult to spot at a distance . . . and now all Karkaroff\\nhad to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like\\nMadame Maxime, would know what was in store for\\nthe champions.\\nBy the looks of it, the only champion who would be\\nfacing the unknown on Tuesday was Cedric.\\nHarry reached the castle, slipped in through the front\\ndoors, and began to climb the marble stairs; he was\\nvery out of breath, but he didn’t dare slow down. ...\\nHe had less than five minutes to get up to the fire. ...\\n“Balderdash!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was\\nsnoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole.\\n“If you say so,” she muttered sleepily, without opening\\nher eyes, and the picture swung forward to admit\\nhim. Harry climbed inside. The common room was\\ndeserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite\\n \\nnormal, Hermione had not needed to set off any\\nDungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy.\\nHarry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw\\nhimself into an armchair in front of the fire. The room\\nwas in semidarkness; the flames were the only source\\nof light. Nearby, on a table, the Support Cedric\\nDiggoryl badges the Creeveys had been trying to\\nimprove were glinting in the firelight. They now read\\nPOTTER REALLY STINKS. Harry looked back into the\\nflames, and jumped.\\nSirius’s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn’t\\nseen Mr. Diggory do exactly this back in the Weasleys’\\nkitchen, it would have scared him out of his wits.\\nInstead, his face breaking into the first smile he had\\nworn for days, he scrambled out of his chair,\\ncrouched down by the hearth, and said, “Sirius —\\nhow ’re you doing?”\\nSirius looked different from Harry’s memory of him.\\nWhen they had said good-bye, Sirius’s face had been\\ngaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long,\\nblack, matted hair — but the hair was short and\\nclean now, Sirius’s face was fuller, and he looked\\nyounger, much more like the only photograph Harry\\nhad of him, which had been taken at the Potters’\\nwedding.\\n“Never mind me, how are you?” said Sirius seriously.\\n“I’m — ” For a second, Harry tried to say “fine” — but\\nhe couldn’t do it. Before he could stop himself, he was\\ntalking more than he’d talked in days — about how\\nno one believed he hadn’t entered the tournament of\\nhis own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about him\\nin the Daily Prophet, how he couldn’t walk down a\\ncorridor without being sneered at — and about Ron,\\nRon not believing him, Ron’s jealousy ...\\n \\n\"... and now Hagrid’s just shown me what’s coming in\\nthe first task, and it’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a\\ngoner,” he finished desperately.\\nSirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that\\nhad not yet lost the look that Azkaban had given\\nthem — that deadened, haunted look. He had let\\nHarry talk himself into silence without interruption,\\nbut now he said, “Dragons we can deal with, Harry,\\nbut we’ll get to that in a minute — I haven’t got long\\nhere ... I’ve broken into a wizarding house to use the\\nfire, but they could be back at any time. There are\\nthings I need to warn you about.”\\n“What?” said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further\\nfew notches. ... Surely there could be nothing worse\\nthan dragons coming?\\n“Karkaroff,” said Sirius. “Harry, he was a Death Eater.\\nYou know what Death Eaters are, don’t you?”\\n“Yes — he — what?”\\n“He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he\\ngot released. I’d bet everything that’s why Dumbledore\\nwanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year — to keep an\\neye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into\\nAzkaban in the first place.”\\n“Karkaroff got released?” Harry said slowly — his\\nbrain seemed to be struggling to absorb yet another\\npiece of shocking information. “Why did they release\\nhim?”\\n“He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,” said Sirius\\nbitterly. “He said he’d seen the error of his ways, and\\nthen he named names ... he put a load of other people\\ninto Azkaban in his place. ... He’s not very popular in\\nthere, I can tell you. And since he got out, from what I\\n \\ncan tell, he’s been teaching the Dark Arts to every\\nstudent who passes through that school of his. So\\nwatch out for the Durmstrang champion as well.”\\n“Okay,” said Harry slowly. “But ... are you saying\\nKarkaroff put my name in the goblet? Because if he\\ndid, he’s a really good actor. He seemed furious about\\nit. He wanted to stop me from competing.”\\n“We know he’s a good actor,” said Sirius, “because he\\nconvinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn’t\\nhe? Now, I’ve been keeping an eye on the Daily\\nProphet, Harry — ”\\n“ — you and the rest of the world,” said Harry bitterly.\\n“ — and reading between the lines of that Skeeter\\nwoman’s article last month, Moody was attacked the\\nnight before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she\\nsays it was another false alarm,” Sirius said hastily,\\nseeing Harry about to speak, “but I don’t think so,\\nsomehow. I think someone tried to stop him from\\ngetting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job\\nwould be a lot more difficult with him around. And no\\none’s going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye’s heard\\nintruders a bit too often. But that doesn’t mean he\\ncan’t still spot the real thing. Moody was the best\\nAuror the Ministry ever had.”\\n“So . . . what are you saying?” said Harry slowly.\\n“Karkaroff’s trying to kill me? But — why?”\\nSirius hesitated.\\n“I’ve been hearing some very strange things,” he said\\nslowly. “The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active\\nthan usual lately. They showed themselves at the\\nQuidditch World Cup, didn’t they? Someone set off\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nthe Dark Mark . . . and then — did you hear about that\\nMinistry of Magic witch who’s gone missing?”\\n“Bertha Jorkins?” said Harry.\\n“Exactly ... she disappeared in Albania, and that’s\\ndefinitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last ...\\nand she would have known the Triwizard Tournament\\nwas coming up, wouldn’t she?”\\n“Yeah, but ... it’s not very likely she’d have walked\\nstraight into Voldemort, is it?” said Harry.\\n“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly.\\n“She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above\\nyour dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very nosy,\\nbut no brains, none at all. It’s not a good\\ncombination, Harry. I’d say she’d be very easy to lure\\ninto a trap.\\n“So ... so Voldemort could have found out about the\\ntournament?” said Harry. “Is that what you mean?\\nYou think Karkaroff might be here on his orders?”\\n“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know\\n... Karkaroff doesn’t strike me as the type who’d go\\nback to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was\\npowerful enough to protect him. But whoever put\\nyour name in that goblet did it for a reason, and I\\ncan’t help thinking the tournament would be a very\\ngood way to attack you and make it look like an\\naccident.”\\n“Looks like a really good plan from where I’m\\nstanding,” said Harry grinning bleakly. “They’ll just\\nhave to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff.”\\n“Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very\\nquickly now. “There’s a way, Harry. Don’t be tempted\\n \\nto try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong and too\\npowerfully magical to be knocked out by a single\\nStunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a\\ntime to overcome a dragon — ”\\n“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry.\\n“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is a way,\\nand a simple spell’s all you need. Just — ”\\nBut Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart\\nsuddenly pounding as though it would burst. He\\ncould hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase\\nbehind him.\\n“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “Go! There’s someone\\ncoming!”\\nHarry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if\\nsomeone saw Sirius’s face within the walls of\\nHogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar — the\\nMinistry would get dragged in — he, Harry, would be\\nquestioned about Sirius’s whereabouts —\\nHarry heard a tiny pop\\\\ in the fire behind him and\\nknew Sirius had gone. He watched the bottom of the\\nspiral staircase. Who had decided to go for a stroll at\\none o’clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from\\ntelling him how to get past a dragon?\\nIt was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas,\\nRon stopped dead facing Harry across the room, and\\nlooked around.\\n“Who were you talking to?” he said.\\n“What’s that got to do with you?” Harry snarled.\\n“What are you doing down here at this time of night?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I just wondered where you — ” Ron broke off,\\nshrugging. “Nothing. I’m going back to bed.”\\n“Just thought you’d come nosing around, did you?”\\nHarry shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what\\nhe’d walked in on, knew he hadn’t done it on purpose,\\nbut he didn’t care — at this moment he hated\\neverything about Ron, right down to the several\\ninches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama\\ntrousers.\\n“Sorry about that,” said Ron, his face reddening with\\nanger. “Should’ve realized you didn’t want to be\\ndisturbed. I’ll let you get on with practicing for your\\nnext interview in peace.”\\nHarry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS\\nbadges off the table and chucked it, as hard as he\\ncould, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead\\nand bounced off.\\n“There you go,” Harry said. “Something for you to\\nwear on Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if\\nyou’re lucky. ... That’s what you want, isn’t it?”\\nHe strode across the room toward the stairs; he half\\nexpected Ron to stop him, he would even have liked\\nRon to throw a punch at him, but Ron just stood\\nthere in his too-small pajamas, and Harry, having\\nstormed upstairs, lay awake in bed fuming for a long\\ntime afterward and didn’t hear him come up to bed.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE FIRST TASK\\nHarry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so\\ninattentively that it was a while before he realized he\\nwas trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his\\nsock. When he’d finally got all his clothes on the right\\nparts of his body, he hurried off to find Hermione,\\nlocating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall,\\nwhere she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling\\ntoo queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had\\nswallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged\\nher out onto the grounds. There, he told her all about\\nthe dragons, and about everything Sirius had said,\\nwhile they took another long walk around the lake.\\nAlarmed as she was by Sirius’s warnings about\\nKarkaroff, Hermione still thought that the dragons\\nwere the more pressing problem.\\n“Let’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday\\nevening,” she said desperately, “and then we can\\nworry about Karkaroff.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThey walked three times around the lake, trying all\\nthe way to think of a simple spell that would subdue\\na dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so\\nthey retired to the library instead. Here, Harry pulled\\ndown every book he could find on dragons, and both\\nof them set to work searching through the large pile.\\n“ ‘Talon-clipping by charms ... treating scale-rot ...’\\nThis is no good, this is for nutters like Hagrid who\\nwant to keep them healthy. ...”\\n“ ‘Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the\\nancient magic that imbues their thick hides, which\\nnone but the most powerful spells can penetrate ...’\\nBut Sirius said a simple one would do it. ...”\\n“Let’s try some simple spellbooks, then,” said Harry,\\nthrowing aside Men Who Love Dragons Too Much.\\nHe returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set\\nthem down, and began to flick through each in turn,\\nHermione whispering nonstop at his elbow.\\n“Well, there are Switching Spells ... but what’s the\\npoint of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs\\nfor wine-gums or something that would make it less\\ndangerous. ... The trouble is, like that book said, not\\nmuch is going to get through a dragon’s hide. ... I’d\\nsay Transfigure it, but something that big, you really\\nhaven’t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall\\n... unless you’re supposed to put the spell on\\nyourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But\\nthey’re not simple spells, I mean, we haven’t done any\\nof those in class, I only know about them because I’ve\\nbeen doing O.W.L. practice papers. ...”\\n“Hermione,” Harry said, through gritted teeth, “will\\nyou shut up for a bit, please? I’m trying to\\nconcentrate.”\\n \\nBut all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was\\nthat Harry’s brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing,\\nwhich didn’t seem to allow room for concentration. He\\nstared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for\\nthe Busy and Vexed. Instant scalping . . . but dragons\\nhad no hair . . . pepper breath . . . that would probably\\nincrease a dragon’s firepower ... horn tongue ... just\\nwhat he needed, to give it an extra weapon . . .\\n“Oh no, he’s back again, why can’t he read on his\\nstupid ship?” said Hermione irritably as Viktor Krum\\nslouched in, cast a surly look over at the pair of them,\\nand settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of\\nbooks. “Come on, Harry, we’ll go back to the common\\nroom ... his fan club’ll be here in a moment, twittering\\naway. ...”\\nAnd sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of\\ngirls tiptoed past them, one of them wearing a\\nBulgaria scarf tied around her waist.\\nHarry barely slept that night. When he awoke on\\nMonday morning, he seriously considered for the first\\ntime ever just running away from Hogwarts. But as\\nhe looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time,\\nand thought about what leaving the castle would\\nmean, he knew he couldn’t do it. It was the only place\\nhe had ever been happy . . . well, he supposed he must\\nhave been happy with his parents too, but he couldn’t\\nremember that.\\nSomehow, the knowledge that he would rather be\\nhere and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive\\nwith Dudley was good to know; it made him feel\\nslightly calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty\\n(his throat wasn’t working too well), and as he and\\nHermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the\\nHufflepuff table.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nCedric still didn’t know about the dragons ... the only\\nchampion who didn’t, if Harry was right in thinking\\nthat Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and\\nKrum. ...\\n“Hermione, I’ll see you in the greenhouses,” Harry\\nsaid, coming to his decision as he watched Cedric\\nleaving the Hall. “Go on, I’ll catch you up.”\\n“Harry, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring — ”\\n“I’ll catch you up, okay?”\\nBy the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble\\nstaircase, Cedric was at the top. He was with a load of\\nsixth-year friends. Harry didn’t want to talk to Cedric\\nin front of them; they were among those who had\\nbeen quoting Rita Skeeter’s article at him every time\\nhe went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance\\nand saw that he was heading toward the Charms\\ncorridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a\\ndistance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took\\ncareful aim.\\n“Diffindol”\\nCedric’s bag split. Parchment, quills, and books\\nspilled out of it onto the floor. Several bottles of ink\\nsmashed.\\n“Don’t bother,” said Cedric in an exasperated voice as\\nhis friends bent down to help him. “Tell Flitwick I’m\\ncoming, go on. ...”\\nThis was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He\\nslipped his wand back into his robes, waited until\\nCedric’s friends had disappeared into their classroom,\\nand hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of\\neveryone but himself and Cedric.\\n \\n“Hi,” said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to\\nAdvanced Transfiguration that was now splattered\\nwith ink. “My bag just split ... brand-new and all ...”\\n“Cedric,” said Harry, “the first task is dragons.”\\n“What?” said Cedric, looking up.\\n“Dragons,” said Harry, speaking quickly, in case\\nProfessor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had\\ngot to. “They’ve got four, one for each of us, and we’ve\\ngot to get past them.”\\nCedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic\\nhe’d been feeling since Saturday night flickering in\\nCedric’s gray eyes.\\n“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice.\\n“Dead sure,” said Harry. “I’ve seen them.”\\n“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to\\nknow. ...”\\n“Never mind,” said Harry quickly — he knew Hagrid\\nwould be in trouble if he told the truth. “But I’m not\\nthe only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will know\\nby now — Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the\\ndragons too.”\\nCedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills,\\nparchment, and books, his ripped bag dangling off\\none shoulder. He stared at Harry, and there was a\\npuzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes.\\n“Why are you telling me?” he asked.\\nHarry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric\\nwouldn’t have asked that if he had seen the dragons\\n \\nhimself. Harry wouldn’t have let his worst enemy face\\nthose monsters unprepared — well, perhaps Malfoy or\\nSnape ...\\n“It’s just ... fair, isn’t it?” he said to Cedric. “We all\\nknow now ... we’re on an even footing, aren’t we?”\\nCedric was still looking at him in a slightly suspicious\\nway when Harry heard a familiar clunking noise\\nbehind him. He turned around and saw Mad-Eye\\nMoody emerging from a nearby classroom.\\n“Come with me, Potter,” he growled. “Diggory, off you\\ngo.”\\nHarry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he\\noverheard them?\\n“Er — Professor, I’m supposed to be in Herbology — ”\\n“Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please. ...”\\nHarry followed him, wondering what was going to\\nhappen to him now. What if Moody wanted to know\\nhow he’d found out about the dragons? Would Moody\\ngo to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn\\nHarry into a ferret? Well, it might be easier to get past\\na dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he’d\\nbe smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty\\nfeet ...\\nHe followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the\\ndoor behind them and turned to look at Harry, his\\nmagical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one.\\n“That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,”\\nMoody said quietly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the\\nreaction he had expected at all.\\n“Sit down,” said Moody, and Harry sat, looking\\naround.\\nHe had visited this office under two of its previous\\noccupants. In Professor Lockhart’s day, the walls had\\nbeen plastered with beaming, winking pictures of\\nProfessor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived\\nhere, you were more likely to come across a specimen\\nof some fascinating new Dark creature he had\\nprocured for them to study in class. Now, however,\\nthe office was full of a number of exceptionally odd\\nobjects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the\\ndays when he had been an Auror.\\nOn his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked,\\nglass spinning top; Harry recognized it at once as a\\nSneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though\\nit was much smaller than Moody’s. In the corner on a\\nsmall table stood an object that looked something like\\nan extra- squiggly, golden television aerial. It was\\nhumming slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung\\nopposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting\\nthe room. Shadowy figures were moving around\\ninside it, none of them clearly in focus.\\n“Like my Dark Detectors, do you?” said Moody, who\\nwas watching Harry closely.\\n“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly\\ngolden aerial.\\n“Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects\\nconcealment and lies ... no use here, of course, too\\nmuch interference — students in every direction lying\\nabout why they haven’t done their homework. Been\\nhumming ever since I got here. I had to disable my\\n \\nSneakoscope because it wouldn’t stop whistling. It’s\\nextra-sensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around. Of\\ncourse, it could be picking up more than kid stuff,” he\\nadded in a growl.\\n“And what’s the mirror for?”\\n“Oh that’s my Foe-Glass. See them out there,\\nskulking around? I’m not really in trouble until I see\\nthe whites of their eyes. That’s when I open my\\ntrunk.”\\nHe let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the\\nlarge trunk under the window. It had seven keyholes\\nin a row. Harry wondered what was in there, until\\nMoody’s next question brought him sharply back to\\nearth.\\n“So ... found out about the dragons, have you?”\\nHarry hesitated. He’d been afraid of this — but he\\nhadn’t told Cedric, and he certainly wasn’t going to\\ntell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.\\n“It’s all right,” said Moody, sitting down and\\nstretching out his wooden leg with a groan.\\n“Cheating’s a traditional part of the Tri-wizard\\nTournament and always has been.”\\n“I didn’t cheat,” said Harry sharply. “It was — a sort\\nof accident that I found out.”\\nMoody grinned. “I wasn’t accusing you, laddie. I’ve\\nbeen telling Dumbledore from the start, he can be as\\nhigh-minded as he likes, but you can bet old\\nKarkaroff and Maxime won’t be. They’ll have told their\\nchampions everything they can. They want to win.\\nThey want to beat Dumbledore. They’d like to prove\\nhe’s only human.”\\n \\nMoody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye\\nswiveled around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to\\nwatch it.\\n“So ... got any ideas how you’re going to get past your\\ndragon yet?” said Moody.\\n“No,” said Harry.\\n“Well, I’m not going to tell you,” said Moody gruffly. “I\\ndon’t show favoritism, me. I’m just going to give you\\nsome good, general advice. And the first bit is — play\\nto your strengths.”\\n“I haven’t got any,” said Harry, before he could stop\\nhimself.\\n“Excuse me,” growled Moody, “you’ve got strengths if I\\nsay you’ve got them. Think now. What are you best\\nat?”\\nHarry tried to concentrate. What was he best at?\\nWell, that was easy, really —\\n“Quidditch,” he said dully, “and a fat lot of help — ”\\n“That’s right,” said Moody, staring at him very hard,\\nhis magical eye barely moving at all. “You’re a damn\\ngood flier from what I’ve heard.”\\n“Yeah, but ...” Harry stared at him. “I’m not allowed a\\nbroom, I’ve only got my wand — ”\\n“My second piece of general advice,” said Moody\\nloudly, interrupting him, “is to use a nice, simple\\nspell that will enable you to get what you need.”\\nHarry looked at him blankly. What did he need?\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Come on, boy ...” whispered Moody. “Put them\\ntogether ... it’s not that difficult. ...”\\nAnd it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to\\npass the dragon in the air. For that, he needed his\\nFirebolt. And for his Firebolt, he needed —\\n“Hermione,” Harry whispered, when he had sped into\\ngreenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried\\napology to Professor Sprout as he passed her.\\n“Hermione — I need you to help me.”\\n“What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?” she\\nwhispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the\\ntop of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.\\n“Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning\\nCharm properly by tomorrow afternoon.”\\nAnd so they practiced. They didn’t have lunch, but\\nheaded for a free classroom, where Harry tried with\\nall his might to make various objects fly across the\\nroom toward him. He was still having problems. The\\nbooks and quills kept losing heart halfway across the\\nroom and dropping like stones to the floor.\\n“Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. ...”\\n“What d’you think I’m trying to do?” said Harry\\nangrily. “A great big dragon keeps popping up in my\\nhead for some reason. ... Okay, try again. ...”\\nHe wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but\\nHermione refused point-blank to skive off\\nArithmancy, and there was no point in staying\\nwithout her. He therefore had to endure over an hour\\nof Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson\\ntelling everyone that the position of Mars with relation\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nto Saturn at that moment meant that people born in\\nJuly were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths.\\n“Well, that’s good,” said Harry loudly, his temper\\ngetting the better of him, “just as long as it’s not\\ndrawn-out. I don’t want to suffer.”\\nRon looked for a moment as though he was going to\\nlaugh; he certainly caught Harry’s eye for the first\\ntime in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful\\ntoward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the lesson\\ntrying to attract small objects toward him under the\\ntable with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom\\nstraight into his hand, though he wasn’t entirely sure\\nthat was his prowess at Summoning Charms —\\nperhaps the fly was just stupid.\\nHe forced down some dinner after Divination, then\\nreturned to the empty classroom with Hermione,\\nusing the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers.\\nThey kept practicing until past midnight. They would\\nhave stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and,\\npretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown\\nat him, started chucking chairs across the room.\\nHarry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise\\nattracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor\\ncommon room, which was now mercifully empty.\\nAt two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the\\nfireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books,\\nquills, several upturned chairs, an old set of\\nGobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in the last\\nhour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning\\nCharm.\\n“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione\\nsaid, looking exhausted but very pleased.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t\\nmanage a spell,” Harry said, throwing a rune\\ndictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again,\\n“threaten me with a dragon. Right ...” He raised his\\nwand once more. “Accio Dictionary !”\\nThe heavy book soared out of Hermione ’s hand, flew\\nacross the room, and Harry caught it.\\n“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione\\ndelightedly.\\n“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The\\nFirebolt’s going to be much farther away than the\\nstuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m\\ngoing to be out there on the grounds. ...”\\n“That doesn’t matter,” said Hermione firmly “Just as\\nlong as you’re concentrating really, really hard on it,\\nit’ll come. Harry, we’d better get some sleep ... you’re\\ngoing to need it.”\\nHarry had been focusing so hard on learning the\\nSummoning Charm that evening that some of his\\nblind panic had left him. It returned in full measure,\\nhowever, on the following morning. The atmosphere\\nin the school was one of great tension and excitement.\\nLessons were to stop at midday, giving all the\\nstudents time to get down to the dragons’ enclosure\\n— though of course, they didn’t yet know what they\\nwould find there.\\nHarry felt oddly separate from everyone around him,\\nwhether they were wishing him good luck or hissing\\n“ We’ll have a box of tissues ready, Potted as he\\npassed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced\\nthat he wondered whether he mightn’t just lose his\\nhead when they tried to lead him out to his dragon,\\nand start trying to curse everyone in sight. Time was\\n \\nbehaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever,\\nrushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he\\nseemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History\\nof Magic, and the next, walking into lunch . . . and\\nthen (where had the morning gone? the last of the\\ndragon-free hours?), Professor McGonagall was\\nhurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of people\\nwere watching.\\n“Potter, the champions have to come down onto the\\ngrounds now. ... You have to get ready for your first\\ntask.”\\n“Okay,” said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto\\nhis plate with a clatter.\\n“Good luck, Harry,” Hermione whispered. “You’ll be\\nfine!”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his\\nown.\\nHe left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She\\ndidn’t seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly\\nas anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the\\nstone steps and out into the cold November afternoon,\\nshe put her hand on his shoulder.\\n“Now, don’t panic,” she said, “just keep a cool head.\\n... We’ve got wizards standing by to control the\\nsituation if it gets out of hand. ... The main thing is\\njust to do your best, and nobody will think any the\\nworse of you. ... Are you all right?”\\n“Yes,” Harry heard himself say. “Yes, I’m fine.”\\nShe was leading him toward the place where the\\ndragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when\\nthey approached the clump of trees behind which the\\n \\nenclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a\\ntent had been erected, its entrance facing them,\\nscreening the dragons from view.\\n“You’re to go in here with the other champions,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice,\\n“and wait for your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in\\nthere ... he’ll be telling you the — the procedure. ...\\nGood luck.”\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left\\nhim at the entrance of the tent. Harry went inside.\\nFleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low\\nwooden stool. She didn’t look nearly as composed as\\nusual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Krum\\nlooked even surlier than usual, which Harry\\nsupposed was his way of showing nerves. Cedric was\\npacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric\\ngave him a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling\\nthe muscles in his face working rather hard, as\\nthough they had forgotten how to do it.\\n“Harry! Good-o!” said Bagman happily, looking\\naround at him. “Come in, come in, make yourself at\\nhome!”\\nBagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown\\ncartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced\\nchampions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again.\\n“Well, now we’re all here — time to fill you in!” said\\nBagman brightly. “When the audience has assembled,\\nI’m going to be offering each of you this bag” — he\\nheld up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at\\nthem — “from which you will each select a small\\nmodel of the thing you are about to face! There are\\ndifferent — er — varieties, you see. And I have to tell\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nyou something else too . . . ah, yes . . . your task is to\\ncollect the golden egg\\\\”\\nHarry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to\\nshow that he understood Bagman’s words, and then\\nstarted pacing around the tent again; he looked\\nslightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn’t\\nreacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be\\nsick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly\\nhow Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for\\nthis. ...\\nAnd in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of\\npairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their\\nowners talking excitedly, laughing, joking. ... Harry\\nfelt as separate from the crowd as though they were a\\ndifferent species. And then — it seemed like about a\\nsecond later to Harry — Bagman was opening the\\nneck of the purple silk sack.\\n“Ladies first,” he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.\\nShe put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out\\na tiny, perfect model of a dragon — a Welsh Green. It\\nhad the number two around its neck. And Harry\\nknew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of\\nsurprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he\\nhad been right: Madame Maxime had told her what\\nwas coming.\\nThe same held true for Krum. He pulled out the\\nscarlet Chinese Fireball. It had a number three\\naround its neck. He didn’t even blink, just sat back\\ndown and stared at the ground.\\nCedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the\\nblueish-gray Swedish Short-Snout, the number one\\ntied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry\\nput his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the\\n \\nHungarian Horntail, and the number four. It\\nstretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared\\nits minuscule fangs.\\n“Well, there you are!” said Bagman. “You have each\\npulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers\\nrefer to the order in which you are to take on the\\ndragons, do you see? Now, I’m going to have to leave\\nyou in a moment, because I’m commentating. Mr.\\nDiggory, you’re first, just go out into the enclosure\\nwhen you hear a whistle, all right? Now ... Harry ...\\ncould I have a quick word? Outside?”\\n“Er ... yes,” said Harry blankly, and he got up and\\nwent out of the tent with Bagman, who walked him a\\nshort distance away, into the trees, and then turned\\nto him with a fatherly expression on his face.\\n“Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?”\\n“What?” said Harry. “I — no, nothing.”\\n“Got a plan?” said Bagman, lowering his voice\\nconspiratorially. “Because I don’t mind sharing a few\\npointers, if you’d like them, you know. I mean,”\\nBagman continued, lowering his voice still further,\\n“you’re the underdog here, Harry. ... Anything I can\\ndo to help ...”\\n“No,” said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded\\nrude, “no — I — I know what I’m going to do, thanks.”\\n“Nobody would know, Harry,” said Bagman, winking\\nat him.\\n“No, I’m fine,” said Harry, wondering why he kept\\ntelling people this, and wondering whether he had\\never been less fine. “I’ve got a plan worked out, I — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nA whistle had blown somewhere.\\n“Good lord, I’ve got to run!” said Bagman in alarm,\\nand he hurried off.\\nHarry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric\\nemerging from it, greener than ever. Harry tried to\\nwish him luck as he walked past, but all that came\\nout of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.\\nHarry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds\\nlater, they heard the roar of the crowd, which meant\\nCedric had entered the enclosure and was now face-\\nto-face with the living counterpart of his model. ...\\nIt was worse than Harry could ever have imagined,\\nsitting there and listening. The crowd screamed . . .\\nyelled . . . gasped like a single many-headed entity, as\\nCedric did whatever he was doing to get past the\\nSwedish Short-Snout. Krum was still staring at the\\nground. Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric’s\\nsteps, around and around the tent. And Bagman’s\\ncommentary made everything much, much worse. ...\\nHorrible pictures formed in Harry’s mind as he heard:\\n“Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” ... “He’s\\ntaking risks, this one!” ... “Clever move — pity it\\ndidn’t work!”\\nAnd then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard\\nthe deafening roar that could mean only one thing:\\nCedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the\\ngolden egg.\\n“Very good indeed!” Bagman was shouting. “And now\\nthe marks from the judges!”\\nBut he didn’t shout out the marks; Harry supposed\\nthe judges were holding them up and showing them\\nto the crowd.\\n \\n“One down, three to go!” Bagman yelled as the whistle\\nblew again. “Miss Delacour, if you please!”\\nFleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more\\nwarmly toward her than he had done so far as she left\\nthe tent with her head held high and her hand\\nclutching her wand. He and Krum were left alone, at\\nopposite sides of the tent, avoiding each other’s gaze.\\nThe same process started again. ... “Oh I’m not sure\\nthat was wise!” they could hear Bagman shouting\\ngleefully. “Oh . . . nearly! Careful now . . . good lord, I\\nthought she’d had it then!”\\nTen minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into\\napplause once more. ... Fleur must have been\\nsuccessful too. A pause, while Fleur’s marks were\\nbeing shown . . . more clapping . . . then, for the third\\ntime, the whistle.\\n“And here comes Mr. Krum!” cried Bagman, and\\nKrum slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone.\\nHe felt much more aware of his body than usual; very\\naware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his\\nfingers tingling with fear ... yet at the same time, he\\nseemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the\\ntent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away.\\n“Very daring!” Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard\\nthe Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek,\\nwhile the crowd drew its collective breath. “That’s\\nsome nerve he’s showing — and — yes, he’s got the\\negg!”\\nApplause shattered the wintery air like breaking\\nglass; Krum had finished — it would be Harry’s turn\\nany moment.\\n \\nHe stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be\\nmade of marshmallow. He waited. And then he heard\\nthe whistle blow. He walked out through the entrance\\nof the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside\\nhim. And now he was walking past the trees, through\\na gap in the enclosure fence.\\nHe saw everything in front of him as though it was a\\nvery highly colored dream. There were hundreds and\\nhundreds of faces staring down at him from stands\\nthat had been magicked there since he’d last stood on\\nthis spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other\\nend of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of\\neggs, her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon\\nhim, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her\\nspiked tail, leaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard\\nground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise,\\nbut whether friendly or not, Harry didn’t know or\\ncare. It was time to do what he had to do ... to focus\\nhis mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that\\nwas his only chance. ...\\nHe raised his wand.\\n“Accio Firebolti” he shouted.\\nHarry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. ... If\\nit hadn’t worked ... if it wasn’t coming ... He seemed\\nto be looking at everything around him through some\\nsort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat\\nhaze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of\\nfaces around him swim strangely. ...\\nAnd then he heard it, speeding through the air behind\\nhim; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward\\nhim around the edge of the woods, soaring into the\\nenclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him,\\nwaiting for him to mount. The crowd was making\\neven more noise. ... Bagman was shouting something\\n \\n... but Harry’s ears were not working properly\\nanymore ... listening wasn’t important. ...\\nHe swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from\\nthe ground. And a second later, something\\nmiraculous happened. ...\\nAs he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his\\nhair, as the crowd’s faces became mere flesh-colored\\npinpricks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size\\nof a dog, he realized that he had left not only the\\nground behind, but also his fear. . . . He was back\\nwhere he belonged. ...\\nThis was just another Quidditch match, that was all\\n... just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail\\nwas just another ugly opposing team. ...\\nHe looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the\\ngold one, gleaming against its cement-colored fellows,\\nresiding safely between the dragon’s front legs.\\n“Okay,” Harry told himself, “diversionary tactics ...\\nlet’s go. ...”\\nHe dived. The Horntail’s head followed him; he knew\\nwhat it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just\\nin time; a jet of fire had been released exactly where\\nhe would have been had he not swerved away . . . but\\nHarry didn’t care ... that was no more than dodging a\\nBludger. ...\\n“Great Scott, he can fly!” yelled Bagman as the crowd\\nshrieked and gasped. “Are you watching this, Mr.\\nKrum?”\\nHarry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still\\nfollowing his progress; its head revolving on its long\\nneck — if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy —\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nbut better not push it too long, or it would be\\nbreathing fire again —\\nHarry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its\\nmouth, but this time he was less lucky — he missed\\nthe flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet\\nhim instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the\\nlong spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes —\\nHe could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and\\ngroans from the crowd, but the cut didn’t seem to be\\ndeep. ... Now he zoomed around the back of the\\nHorntail, and a possibility occurred to him. ...\\nThe Horntail didn’t seem to want to take off, she was\\ntoo protective of her eggs. Though she writhed and\\ntwisted, furling and unfurling her wings and keeping\\nthose fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid\\nto move too far from them . . . but he had to persuade\\nher to do it, or he’d never get near them. ... The trick\\nwas to do it carefully, gradually. . . .\\nHe began to fly, first this way, then the other, not\\nnear enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off,\\nbut still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept\\nher eyes on him. Her head swayed this way and that,\\nwatching him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs\\nbared. ...\\nHe flew higher. The Horntail’s head rose with him, her\\nneck now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying,\\nlike a snake before its charmer. . . .\\nHarry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of\\nexasperation. He was like a fly to her, a fly she was\\nlonging to swat; her tail thrashed again, but he was\\ntoo high to reach now. ... She shot fire into the air,\\nwhich he dodged. ... Her jaws opened wide. ...\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Come on,” Harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above\\nher, “come on, come and get me ... up you get now ...”\\nAnd then she reared, spreading her great, black,\\nleathery wings at last, as wide as those of a small\\nairplane — and Harry dived. Before the dragon knew\\nwhat he had done, or where he had disappeared to,\\nhe was speeding toward the ground as fast as he\\ncould go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her\\nclawed front legs — he had taken his hands off his\\nFirebolt — he had seized the golden egg —\\nAnd with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was\\nsoaring out over the stands, the heavy egg safely\\nunder his uninjured arm, and it was as though\\nsomebody had just turned the volume back up — for\\nthe first time, he became properly aware of the noise\\nof the crowd, which was screaming and applauding as\\nloudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup —\\n“Look at that!” Bagman was yelling. “Will you look at\\nthat! Our youngest champion is quickest to get his\\negg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr.\\nPotter!”\\nHarry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to\\nsubdue the Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the\\nenclosure, Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody,\\nand Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving\\nhim toward them, their smiles evident even from this\\ndistance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of\\nthe crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in\\nsmoothly to land, his heart lighter than it had been in\\nweeks. ... He had got through the first task, he had\\nsurvived. ...\\n“That was excellent, Potter!” cried Professor\\nMcGonagall as he got off the Firebolt — which from\\nher was extravagant praise. He noticed that her hand\\n \\nshook as she pointed at his shoulder. “You’ll need to\\nsee Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your\\nscore. ... Over there, she’s had to mop up Diggory\\nalready. ...”\\n“Yeh did it, Harry!” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Yeh did it!\\nAn’ agains’ the Horntail an’ all, an’ yeh know Charlie\\nsaid that was the wors’ — ”\\n“Thanks, Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid\\nwouldn’t blunder on and reveal that he had shown\\nHarry the dragons beforehand.\\nProfessor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical\\neye was dancing in its socket.\\n“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled.\\n“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please ...” said\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\nHarry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and\\nsaw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a\\nsecond tent, looking worried.\\n“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling\\nHarry inside. The tent was divided into cubicles; he\\ncould make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas,\\nbut Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was\\nsitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s\\nshoulder, talking furiously all the while. “Last year\\ndementors, this year dragons, what are they going to\\nbring into this school next? You’re very lucky ... this\\nis quite shallow ... it’ll need cleaning before I heal it\\nup, though. ...”\\nShe cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid\\nthat smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder\\nwith her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.\\n \\n“Now, just sit quietly for a minute — sit! And then you\\ncan go and get your score.”\\nShe bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next\\ndoor and say, “How does it feel now, Diggory?”\\nHarry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of\\nadrenaline. He got to his feet, wanting to see what\\nwas going on outside, but before he’d reached the\\nmouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside\\n— Hermione, followed closely by Ron.\\n“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily.\\nThere were fingernail marks on her face where she\\nhad been clutching it in fear. “You were amazing! You\\nreally were!”\\nBut Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white\\nand staring at Harry as though he were a ghost.\\n“Harry,” he said, very seriously, “whoever put your\\nname in that goblet — I — I reckon they’re trying to\\ndo you in!”\\nIt was as though the last few weeks had never\\nhappened — as though Harry were meeting Ron for\\nthe first time, right after he’d been made champion.\\n“Caught on, have you?” said Harry coldly. “Took you\\nlong enough.”\\nHermione stood nervously between them, looking\\nfrom one to the other. Ron opened his mouth\\nuncertainly. Harry knew Ron was about to apologize\\nand suddenly he found he didn’t need to hear it.\\n“It’s okay,” he said, before Ron could get the words\\nout. “Forget it.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“No,” said Ron, “I shouldn’t’ve — ”\\n“ Forget it,” Harry said.\\nRon grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned\\nback.\\nHermione burst into tears.\\n“There’s nothing to cry about!” Harry told her,\\nbewildered.\\n“You two are so stupid).” she shouted, stamping her\\nfoot on the ground, tears splashing down her front.\\nThen, before either of them could stop her, she had\\ngiven both of them a hug and dashed away, now\\npositively howling.\\n“Barking mad,” said Ron, shaking his head. “Harry,\\nc’mon, they’ll be putting up your scores. ...”\\nPicking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling\\nmore elated than he would have believed possible an\\nhour ago, Harry ducked out of the tent, Ron by his\\nside, talking fast.\\n“You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric\\ndid this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on\\nthe ground . . . turned it into a dog ... he was trying to\\nmake the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well,\\nit was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort\\nof worked, because he did get the egg, but he got\\nburned as well — the dragon changed its mind\\nhalfway through and decided it would rather have\\nhim than the Labrador; he only just got away. And\\nthat Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she\\nwas trying to put it into a trance — well, that kind of\\nworked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and\\nthis great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught\\n \\nfire — she put it out with a bit of water out of her\\nwand. And Krum — you won’t believe this, but he\\ndidn’t even think of flying! He was probably the best\\nafter you, though. Hit it with some sort of spell right\\nin the eye. Only thing is, it went trampling around in\\nagony and squashed half the real eggs — they took\\nmarks off for that, he wasn’t supposed to do any\\ndamage to them.”\\nRon drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of\\nthe enclosure. Now that the Horntail had been taken\\naway, Harry could see where the five judges were\\nsitting — right at the other end, in raised seats\\ndraped in gold.\\n“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” Ron said, and\\nHarry, squinting up the field, saw the first judge —\\nMadame Maxime — raise her wand in the air. What\\nlooked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it, which\\ntwisted itself into a large figure eight.\\n“Not bad!” said Ron as the crowd applauded. “I\\nsuppose she took marks off for your shoulder. ...”\\nMr. Crouch came next. He shot a number nine into\\nthe air.\\n“Looking good!” Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the\\nback.\\nNext, Dumbledore. He too put up a nine. The crowd\\nwas cheering harder than ever.\\nLudo Bagman — ten.\\n“Ten?” said Harry in disbelief. “But ... I got hurt. ...\\nWhat’s he playing at?”\\n“Harry, don’t complain!” Ron yelled excitedly.\\n \\nAnd now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a\\nmoment, and then a number shot out of his wand too\\n— four.\\n“What?” Ron bellowed furiously. “Four? You lousy,\\nbiased scumbag, you gave Krum ten!”\\nBut Harry didn’t care, he wouldn’t have cared if\\nKarkaroff had given him zero; Ron’s indignation on\\nhis behalf was worth about a hundred points to him.\\nHe didn’t tell Ron this, of course, but his heart felt\\nlighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure.\\nAnd it wasn’t just Ron ... those weren’t only\\nGryffindors cheering in the crowd. When it had come\\nto it, when they had seen what he was facing, most of\\nthe school had been on his side as well as Cedric’s. ...\\nHe didn’t care about the Slytherins, he could stand\\nwhatever they threw at him now.\\n“You’re tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!” said\\nCharlie Weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off\\nback toward the school. “Listen, I’ve got to run, I’ve\\ngot to go and send Mum an owl, I swore I’d tell her\\nwhat happened — but that was unbelievable! Oh yeah\\n— and they told me to tell you you’ve got to hang\\naround for a few more minutes. ... Bagman wants a\\nword, back in the champions’ tent.”\\nRon said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent,\\nwhich somehow looked quite different now: friendly\\nand welcoming. He thought back to how he’d felt\\nwhile dodging the Horntail, and compared it to the\\nlong wait before he’d walked out to face it. ... There\\nwas no comparison; the wait had been immeasurably\\nworse.\\nFleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One\\nside of Cedric’s face was covered in a thick orange\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\npaste, which was presumably mending his burn. He\\ngrinned at Harry when he saw him.\\n“Good one, Harry.”\\n“And you,” said Harry, grinning back.\\n“Well done, all of you!” said Ludo Bagman, bouncing\\ninto the tent and looking as pleased as though he\\npersonally had just got past a dragon. “Now, just a\\nquick few words. You’ve got a nice long break before\\nthe second task, which will take place at half past\\nnine on the morning of February the twenty-fourth —\\nbut we’re giving you something to think about in the\\nmeantime! If you look down at those golden eggs\\nyou’re all holding, you will see that they open ... see\\nthe hinges there? You need to solve the clue inside\\nthe egg — because it will tell you what the second\\ntask is, and enable you to prepare for it! All clear?\\nSure? Well, off you go, then!”\\nHarry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to\\nwalk back around the edge of the forest, talking hard;\\nHarry wanted to hear what the other champions had\\ndone in more detail. Then, as they rounded the clump\\nof trees behind which Harry had first heard the\\ndragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them.\\nIt was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes\\ntoday; the Quick-Quotes Quill in her hand blended\\nperfectly against them.\\n“Congratulations, Harry!” she said, beaming at him. “I\\nwonder if you could give me a quick word? How you\\nfelt facing that dragon? How you feel now, about the\\nfairness of the scoring?”\\n“Yeah, you can have a word,” said Harry savagely.\\n“Good-bye.”\\n \\nAnd he set off back to the castle with Ron.\\n \\nTHE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that\\nevening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send\\nSirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get\\npast his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled\\nRon in on everything Sirius had told him about\\nKarkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that\\nKarkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they\\nentered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to\\nhave suspected it all along.\\n“Fits, doesn’t it?” he said. “Remember what Malfoy\\nsaid on the train, about his dad being friends with\\nKarkaroff? Now we know where they knew each other.\\nThey were probably running around in masks\\ntogether at the World Cup. ... I’ll tell you one thing,\\nthough, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name\\nin the goblet, he’s going to be feeling really stupid\\nnow, isn’t he? Didn’t work, did it? You only got a\\nscratch! Come here — I’ll do it — ”\\nPigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery\\nhe was flying around and around Harry’s head,\\n \\nhooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of\\nthe air and held him still while Harry attached the\\nletter to his leg.\\n“There’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be\\nthat dangerous, how could they be?” Ron went on as\\nhe carried Pigwidgeon to the window. “You know\\nwhat? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry,\\nI’m serious.”\\nHarry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up\\nfor his behavior of the last few weeks, but he\\nappreciated it all the same. Hermione, however,\\nleaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and\\nfrowned at Ron.\\n“Harry’s got a long way to go before he finishes this\\ntournament,” she said seriously. “If that was the first\\ntask, I hate to think what’s coming next.”\\n“Right little ray of sunshine, aren’t you?” said Ron.\\n“You and Professor Trelawney should get together\\nsometime.”\\nHe threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon\\nplummeted twelve feet before managing to pull\\nhimself back up again; the letter attached to his leg\\nwas much longer and heavier than usual — Harry\\nhadn’t been able to resist giving Sirius a blow-by-blow\\naccount of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and\\ndodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon\\ndisappear into the darkness, and then Ron said,\\n“Well, we’d better get downstairs for your surprise\\nparty, Harry — Fred and George should have nicked\\nenough food from the kitchens by now.”\\nSure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor\\ncommon room it exploded with cheers and yells again.\\nThere were mountains of cakes and flagons of\\n \\npumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee\\nJordan had let off some Filibuster’s Fireworks, so that\\nthe air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean\\nThomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up\\nsome impressive new banners, most of which depicted\\nHarry zooming around the Horntail’s head on his\\nFirebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his\\nhead on fire.\\nHarry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten\\nwhat it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down\\nwith Ron and Hermione. He couldn’t believe how\\nhappy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he’d\\ngotten through the first task, and he wouldn’t have to\\nface the second one for three months.\\n“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up\\nthe golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and\\nweighing it in his hands. “Open it, Harry, go on! Let’s\\njust see what’s inside it!”\\n“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,”\\nHermione said swiftly. “It’s in the tournament rules.\\n“I was supposed to work out how to get past the\\ndragon on my own too,” Harry muttered, so only\\nHermione could hear him, and she grinned rather\\nguiltily.\\n“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed.\\nLee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his\\nfingernails into the groove that ran all the way around\\nit and prised it open.\\nIt was hollow and completely empty — but the\\nmoment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a\\nloud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The\\n \\nnearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost\\norchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party,\\nwho had all been playing the musical saw.\\n“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.\\n“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at\\nthe egg as Harry slammed it shut again. “Sounded\\nlike a banshee. ... Maybe you’ve got to get past one of\\nthose next, Harry!”\\n“It was someone being tortured!” said Neville, who\\nhad gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over\\nthe floor. “You’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus\\nCurse!”\\n“Don’t be a prat, Neville, that’s illegal,” said George.\\n“They wouldn’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the\\nchampions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy\\nsinging ... maybe you’ve got to attack him while he’s\\nin the shower, Harry.”\\n“Want a jam tart, Hermione?” said Fred.\\nHermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was\\noffering her. Fred grinned.\\n“It’s all right,” he said. “I haven’t done anything to\\nthem. It’s the custard creams you’ve got to watch — ”\\nNeville, who had just bitten into a custard cream,\\nchoked and spat it out. Fred laughed.\\n“Just my little joke, Neville. ...”\\nHermione took a jam tart. Then she said, “Did you get\\nall this from the kitchens, Fred?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Yep,” said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-\\npitched squeak and imitated a house-elf. “ ‘Anything\\nwe can get you, sir, anything at all!’ They’re dead\\nhelpful ... get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.”\\n“How do you get in there?” Hermione said in an\\ninnocently casual sort of voice.\\n“Easy,” said Fred, “concealed door behind a painting\\nof a bowl of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles\\nand — ” He stopped and looked suspiciously at her.\\n“Why?”\\n“Nothing,” said Hermione quickly.\\n“Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike\\nnow, are you?” said George. “Going to give up all the\\nleaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?”\\nSeveral people chortled. Hermione didn’t answer.\\n“Don’t you go upsetting them and telling them they’ve\\ngot to take clothes and salaries!” said Fred warningly.\\n“You’ll put them off their cooking!”\\nJust then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning\\ninto a large canary.\\n“Oh — sorry, Neville!” Fred shouted over all the\\nlaughter. “I forgot — it was the custard creams we\\nhexed — ”\\nWithin a minute, however, Neville had molted, and\\nonce his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking\\nentirely normal. He even joined in laughing.\\n“Canary Creams!” Fred shouted to the excitable\\ncrowd. “George and I invented them — seven Sickles\\neach, a bargain!”\\n \\nIt was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally\\nwent up to the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus,\\nand Dean. Before he pulled the curtains of his four-\\nposter shut, Harry set his tiny model of the\\nHungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed,\\nwhere it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes.\\nReally, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on\\nhis four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point . . . they\\nwere all right, really, dragons. ...\\nThe start of December brought wind and sleet to\\nHogwarts. Drafty though the castle always was in\\nwinter, Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls\\nevery time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the\\nlake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black\\nsails billowing against the dark skies. He thought the\\nBeauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly\\ntoo. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame\\nMaxime’s horses well provided with their preferred\\ndrink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from\\nthe trough in the corner of their paddock was enough\\nto make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class\\nlight-headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still\\ntending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits\\nabout them.\\n“I’m not sure whether they hibernate or not,” Hagrid\\ntold the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch\\nnext lesson. “Thought we’d jus’ try an’ see if they\\nfancied a kip ... we’ll jus’ settle ’em down in these\\nboxes. ...”\\nThere were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their\\ndesire to kill one another had not been exercised out\\nof them. Each of them was now approaching six feet\\nin length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful,\\nscuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings\\nand their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the\\nmost repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class\\n \\nlooked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had\\nbrought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets.\\n“Well jus’ lead ’em in here,” Hagrid said, “an’ put the\\nlids on, and we’ll see what happens.”\\nBut the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and\\ndid not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes\\nand nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, “Don’ panic,\\nnow, don’ panic!” while the skrewts rampaged around\\nthe pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering\\nwreckage of the boxes. Most of the class — Malfoy,\\nCrabbe, and Goyle in the lead — had fled into\\nHagrid ’s cabin through the back door and barricaded\\nthemselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however,\\nwere among those who remained outside trying to\\nhelp Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and\\ntie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of\\nnumerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt\\nwas left.\\n“Don’ frighten him, now!” Hagrid shouted as Ron and\\nHarry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at\\nthe skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on\\nthem, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. “Jus’\\ntry an’ slip the rope ’round his sting, so he won’ hurt\\nany o’ the others!”\\n“Yeah, we wouldn’t want that!” Ron shouted angrily\\nas he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid ’s\\ncabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks.\\n“Well, well, well ... this does look like fun.”\\nRita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid ’s garden fence,\\nlooking in at the mayhem. She was wearing a thick\\nmagenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and\\nher crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt\\nthat was cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a\\nblast of fire shot out of its end, withering the\\npumpkin plants nearby.\\n“Who ’re you?” Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he\\nslipped a loop of rope around the skrewt’s sting and\\ntightened it.\\n“Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,” Rita replied,\\nbeaming at him. Her gold teeth glinted.\\n“Thought Dumbledore said you weren’ allowed inside\\nthe school anymore,” said Hagrid, frowning slightly as\\nhe got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started\\ntugging it over to its fellows.\\nRita acted as though she hadn’t heard what Hagrid\\nhad said.\\n“What are these fascinating creatures called?” she\\nasked, beaming still more widely.\\n“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” grunted Hagrid.\\n“Really?” said Rita, apparently full of lively interest.\\n“I’ve never heard of them before ... where do they\\ncome from?”\\nHarry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of\\nHagrid’s wild black beard, and his heart sank. Where\\nhad Hagrid got the skrewts from? Hermione, who\\nseemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly,\\n“They’re very interesting, aren’t they? Aren’t they,\\nHarry?”\\n“What? Oh yeah ... ouch ... interesting,” said Harry as\\nshe stepped on his foot.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Ah, you’re here, Harry!” said Rita Skeeter as she\\nlooked around. “So you like Care of Magical\\nCreatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.\\n“Lovely,” said Rita. “Really lovely. Been teaching\\nlong?” she added to Hagrid.\\nHarry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a\\nnasty cut across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes\\nwere badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several\\nburnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where\\nmost of the class stood, their noses pressed against\\nthe glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.\\n“This is o’ny me second year,” said Hagrid.\\n“Lovely... I don’t suppose you’d like to give an\\ninterview, would you? Share some of your experience\\nof magical creatures? The Prophet does a zoological\\ncolumn every Wednesday, as I’m sure you know. We\\ncould feature these — er — Bang-Ended Scoots.”\\n“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” Hagrid said eagerly. “Er —\\nyeah, why not?”\\nHarry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was\\nno way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita\\nSkeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in\\nsilence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made\\narrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a\\ngood long interview later that week. Then the bell\\nrang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson.\\n“Well, good-bye, Harry!” Rita Skeeter called merrily to\\nhim as he set off with Ron and Hermione. “Until\\nFriday night, then, Hagrid!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Shell twist everything he says,” Harry said under his\\nbreath.\\n“Just as long as he didn’t import those skrewts\\nillegally or anything,” said Hermione desperately.\\nThey looked at one another — it was exactly the sort\\nof thing Hagrid might do.\\n“Hagrid’s been in loads of trouble before, and\\nDumbledore’s never sacked him,” said Ron\\nconsolingly. “Worst that can happen is Hagrid’ll have\\nto get rid of the skrewts. Sorry ... did I say worst? I\\nmeant best.”\\nHarry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly\\nmore cheerful, went off to lunch.\\nHarry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that\\nafternoon; they were still doing star charts and\\npredictions, but now that he and Ron were friends\\nonce more, the whole thing seemed very funny again.\\nProfessor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with\\nthe pair of them when they had been predicting their\\nown horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they\\nsniggered through her explanation of the various\\nways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.\\n“I would think,” she said, in a mystical whisper that\\ndid not conceal her obvious annoyance, “that some of\\nus” — she stared very meaningfully at Harry —\\n“might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I\\nhave seen during my crystal gazing last night. As I sat\\nhere, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult\\nthe orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself\\nbefore it, and I gazed into its crystalline depths . . . and\\nwhat do you think I saw gazing back at me?”\\n“An ugly old bat in outsize specs?” Ron muttered\\nunder his breath.\\n \\nHarry fought hard to keep his face straight.\\n“Death, my dears.”\\nParvati and Lavender both put their hands over their\\nmouths, looking horrified.\\n“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively,\\n“it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a\\nvulture, ever lower ... ever lower over the castle. ...”\\nShe stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very\\nwidely and obviously.\\n“It’d be a bit more impressive if she hadn’t done it\\nabout eighty times before,” Harry said as they finally\\nregained the fresh air of the staircase beneath\\nProfessor Trelawney’s room. “But if I’d dropped dead\\nevery time she’s told me I’m going to, I’d be a medical\\nmiracle.”\\n“You’d be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,” said\\nRon, chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going\\nin the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring\\nsinisterly. “At least we didn’t get homework. I hope\\nHermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not\\nworking when she is. ...”\\nBut Hermione wasn’t at dinner, nor was she in the\\nlibrary when they went to look for her afterward. The\\nonly person in there was Viktor Krum. Ron hovered\\nbehind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum,\\ndebating in whispers with Harry whether he should\\nask for an autograph — but then Ron realized that six\\nor seven girls were lurking in the next row of books,\\ndebating exactly the same thing, and he lost his\\nenthusiasm for the idea.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Wonder where she’s got to?” Ron said as he and\\nHarry went back to Gryffindor Tower.\\n“Dunno ... balderdash.”\\nBut the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward\\nwhen the sound of racing feet behind them\\nannounced Hermione’s arrival.\\n“Harry!” she panted, skidding to a halt beside him\\n(the Fat Lady stared down at her, eyebrows raised).\\n“Harry, you’ve got to come — you’ve got to come, the\\nmost amazing thing’s happened — please — ”\\nShe seized Harry’s arm and started to try to drag him\\nback along the corridor.\\n“What’s the matter?” Harry said.\\n“I’ll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick\\nHarry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry,\\nintrigued.\\n“Okay,” Harry said, starting off back down the\\ncorridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.\\n“Oh don’t mind me!” the Fat Lady called irritably after\\nthem. “Don’t apologize for bothering me! I’ll just hang\\nhere, wide open, until you get back, shall I?”\\n“Yeah, thanks!” Ron shouted over his shoulder.\\n“Hermione, where are we going?” Harry asked, after\\nshe had led them down through six floors, and\\nstarted down the marble staircase into the entrance\\nhall.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione\\nexcitedly.\\nShe turned left at the bottom of the staircase and\\nhurried toward the door through which Cedric\\nDiggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire\\nhad regurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry had\\nnever been through here before. He and Ron followed\\nHermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of\\nending up in a gloomy underground passage like the\\none that led to Snape’s dungeon, they found\\nthemselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with\\ntorches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that\\nwere mainly of food.\\n“Oh hang on ...” said Harry slowly, halfway down the\\ncorridor. “Wait a minute, Hermione. ...”\\n“What?” She turned around to look at him,\\nanticipation all over her face.\\n“I know what this is about,” said Harry.\\nHe nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just\\nbehind Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit\\nbowl.\\n“Hermione!” said Ron, cottoning on. “You’re trying to\\nrope us into that spew stuff again!”\\n“No, no, I’m not!” she said hastily. “And it’s not spew,\\nRon — ”\\n“Changed the name, have you?” said Ron, frowning at\\nher. “What are we now, then, the House-Elf Liberation\\nFront? I’m not barging into that kitchen and trying to\\nmake them stop work, I’m not doing it — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n‘Tm not asking you to!” Hermione said impatiently. “I\\ncame down here just now, to talk to them all, and I\\nfound — oh come on, Harry, I want to show you!”\\nShe seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the\\npicture of the giant fruit bowl, stretched out her\\nforefinger, and tickled the huge green pear. It began\\nto squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a\\nlarge green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled\\nthe door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back,\\nforcing him inside.\\nHe had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-\\nceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with\\nmounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped\\naround the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at\\nthe other end, when something small hurtled toward\\nhim from the middle of the room, squealing, “Harry\\nPotter, sir! Harry Potteri”\\nNext second all the wind had been knocked out of\\nhim as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff,\\nhugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would\\nbreak.\\n“D-Dobby?” Harry gasped.\\n“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from\\nsomewhere around his navel. “Dobby has been\\nhoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry\\nPotter has come to see him, sir!”\\nDobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming\\nup at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped\\neyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked\\nalmost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-\\nshaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and\\nfeet — all except the clothes, which were very\\ndifferent.\\n \\nWhen Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had\\nalways worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now,\\nhowever, he was wearing the strangest assortment of\\ngarments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even\\nworse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the\\nWorld Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on\\nwhich he had pinned a number of bright badges; a tie\\npatterned with horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of\\nwhat looked like children’s soccer shorts, and odd\\nsocks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one\\nHarry had removed from his own foot and tricked Mr.\\nMalfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free.\\nThe other was covered in pink and orange stripes.\\n“Dobby, what’re you doing here?” Harry said in\\namazement.\\n“Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!” Dobby\\nsquealed excitedly. “Professor Dumbledore gave\\nDobby and Winky jobs, sir!”\\n“Winky?” said Harry. “She’s here too?”\\n“Yes, sir, yes!” said Dobby, and he seized Harry’s\\nhand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the\\nfour long wooden tables that stood there. Each of\\nthese tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was\\npositioned exactly beneath the four House tables\\nabove, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were\\nclear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed\\nthat an hour ago they had been laden with dishes\\nthat were then sent up through the ceiling to their\\ncounterparts above.\\nAt least a hundred little elves were standing around\\nthe kitchen, beaming, bowing, and curtsying as\\nDobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing the\\nsame uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts\\ncrest, and tied, as Winky’s had been, like a toga.\\n \\nDobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and\\npointed.\\n“Winky, sir!” he said.\\nWinky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike\\nDobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes. She\\nwas wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a\\nmatching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large\\nears. However, while every one of Dobby ’s strange\\ncollection of garments was so clean and well cared for\\nthat it looked brand-new, Winky was plainly not\\ntaking care of her clothes at all. There were soup\\nstains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.\\n“Hello, Winky,” said Harry.\\nWinky’s lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which\\nspilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed\\ndown her front, just as they had done at the\\nQuidditch World Cup.\\n“Oh dear,” said Hermione. She and Ron had followed\\nHarry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. “Winky,\\ndon’t cry, please don’t ...”\\nBut Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the\\nother hand, beamed up at Harry.\\n“Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?” he squeaked\\nloudly, over Winky’s sobs.\\n“Er — yeah, okay,” said Harry.\\nInstantly, about six house-elves came trotting up\\nbehind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a\\nteapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a milk\\njug, and a large plate of biscuits.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Good service!” Ron said, in an impressed voice.\\nHermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked\\ndelighted; they bowed very low and retreated.\\n“How long have you been here, Dobby?” Harry asked\\nas Dobby handed around the tea.\\n“Only a week, Harry Potter, sir!” said Dobby happily.\\n“Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You\\nsee, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has\\nbeen dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult\\nindeed — ”\\nAt this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-\\ntomato of a nose dribbling all down her front, though\\nshe made no effort to stem the flow.\\n“Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years,\\nsir, trying to find work!” Dobby squeaked. “But Dobby\\nhasn’t found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying\\nnow!”\\nThe house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been\\nlistening and watching with interest, all looked away\\nat these words, as though Dobby had said something\\nrude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said,\\n“Good for you, Dobby!”\\n“Thank you, miss!” said Dobby, grinning toothily at\\nher. “But most wizards doesn’t want a house-elf who\\nwants paying, miss. That’s not the point of a house-\\nelf,’ they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby ’s\\nface! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes\\nand he wants to be paid, Harry Potter. . . . Dobby likes\\nbeing free!”\\nThe Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging\\naway from Dobby, as though he were carrying\\nsomething contagious. Winky, however, remained\\n \\nwhere she was, though there was a definite increase\\nin the volume of her crying.\\n“And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky,\\nand finds out Winky has been freed too, sir!” said\\nDobby delightedly.\\nAt this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and\\nlay facedown on the flagged stone floor, beating her\\ntiny fists upon it and positively screaming with\\nmisery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees\\nbeside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she\\nsaid made the slightest difference. Dobby continued\\nwith his story, shouting shrilly over Winky’s\\nscreeches.\\n“And then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir! Why\\ndoesn’t Dobby and Winky find work together?’ Dobby\\nsays. Where is there enough work for two house-\\nelves?’ says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes\\nto him, sir! Hogwarts\\\\ So Dobby and Winky came to\\nsee Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor\\nDumbledore took us on!”\\nDobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled\\nin his eyes again.\\n“And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby,\\nsir, if Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf,\\nsir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off\\na month!”\\n“That’s not very much!” Hermione shouted\\nindignantly from the floor, over Winky’s continued\\nscreaming and fist-beating.\\n“Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a\\nweek, and weekends off,” said Dobby, suddenly giving\\na little shiver, as though the prospect of so much\\n \\nleisure and riches were frightening, “but Dobby beat\\nhim down, miss. ... Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he\\nisn’t wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.”\\n“And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you,\\nWinky?” Hermione asked kindly.\\nIf she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she\\nwas wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when\\nshe sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her\\nmassive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and\\nsuddenly furious.\\n“Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting\\npaid!” she squeaked. “Winky is not sunk so low as\\nthat! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!”\\n“Ashamed?” said Hermione blankly. “But — Winky,\\ncome on! It’s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not\\nyou! You didn’t do anything wrong, he was really\\nhorrible to you — ”\\nBut at these words, Winky clapped her hands over\\nthe holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she\\ncouldn’t hear a word, and screeched, “You is not\\ninsulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr.\\nCrouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr.\\nCrouch is right to sack bad Winky!”\\n“Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,”\\nsqueaked Dobby confidentially. “Winky forgets she is\\nnot bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is allowed to\\nspeak her mind now, but she won’t do it.”\\n“Can’t house-elves speak their minds about their\\nmasters, then?” Harry asked.\\n“Oh no, sir, no,” said Dobby, looking suddenly\\nserious. “ Tis part of the house-elf’s enslavement, sir.\\n \\nWe keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We\\nupholds the family’s honor, and we never speaks ill of\\nthem — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he\\ndoes not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said\\nwe is free to — to — ”\\nDobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry\\ncloser. Harry bent forward. Dobby whispered, “He\\nsaid we is free to call him a — a barmy old codger if\\nwe likes, sir!”\\nDobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.\\n“But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,” he said,\\ntalking normally again, and shaking his head so that\\nhis ears flapped. “Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore\\nvery much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and\\nour silence for him.”\\n“But you can say what you like about the Malfoys\\nnow?” Harry asked him, grinning.\\nA slightly fearful look came into Dobby’s immense\\neyes.\\n“Dobby — Dobby could,” he said doubtfully. He\\nsquared his small shoulders. “Dobby could tell Harry\\nPotter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark\\nwizards\\'.”\\nDobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-\\nstruck by his own daring — then he rushed over to\\nthe nearest table and began banging his head on it\\nvery hard, squealing, “ Bad Dobby ! Bad Dobby\\\\”\\nHarry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled\\nhim away from the table.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Thank you, Harry Potter, thank you,” said Dobby\\nbreathlessly, rubbing his head.\\n“You just need a bit of practice,” Harry said.\\n“Practice!” squealed Winky furiously. “You is ought to\\nbe ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way\\nabout your masters!”\\n“They isn’t my masters anymore, Winky!” said Dobby\\ndefiantly. “Dobby doesn’t care what they think\\nanymore!”\\n“Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!” moaned Winky, tears\\nleaking down her face once more. “My poor Mr.\\nCrouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is\\nneeding me, he is needing my help! I is looking after\\nthe Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it\\nbefore me, and my grandmother is doing it before her\\n...oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was\\nfreed? Oh the shame, the shame!” She buried her face\\nin her skirt again and bawled.\\n“Winky,” said Hermione firmly, “I’m quite sure Mr.\\nCrouch is getting along perfectly well without you.\\nWe’ve seen him, you know — ”\\n“You is seeing my master?” said Winky breathlessly,\\nraising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more\\nand goggling at Hermione. “You is seeing him here at\\nHogwarts?”\\n“Yes,” said Hermione, “he and Mr. Bagman are judges\\nin the Tri-wizard Tournament.”\\n“Mr. Bagman comes too?” squeaked Winky, and to\\nHarry’s great surprise (and Ron’s and Hermione’s too,\\nby the looks on their faces), she looked angry again.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My\\nmaster isn’t liking him, oh no, not at all!”\\n“Bagman — bad?” said Harry.\\n“Oh yes,” Winky said, nodding her head furiously.\\n“My master is telling Winky some things! But Winky\\nis not saying ... Winky — Winky keeps her master’s\\nsecrets. ...”\\nShe dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her\\nsobbing into her skirt, “Poor master, poor master, no\\nWinky to help him no more!”\\nThey couldn’t get another sensible word out of Winky.\\nThey left her to her crying and finished their tea,\\nwhile Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf\\nand his plans for his wages.\\n“Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!”\\nhe said happily, pointing at his bare chest.\\n“Tell you what, Dobby,” said Ron, who seemed to have\\ntaken a great liking to the elf, “I’ll give you the one my\\nmum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from\\nher. You don’t mind maroon, do you?”\\nDobby was delighted.\\n“We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,” Ron told\\nhim, “but it’ll go well with your tea cozy.”\\nAs they prepared to take their leave, many of the\\nsurrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering\\nsnacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with\\na pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and\\ncurtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets\\nwith cream cakes and pies.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Thanks a lot!” Harry said to the elves, who had all\\nclustered around the door to say good night. “See\\nyou, Dobby!”\\n“Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you\\nsometimes, sir?” Dobby asked tentatively.\\n“ ’Course you can,” said Harry, and Dobby beamed.\\n“You know what?” said Ron, once he, Hermione, and\\nHarry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing\\nthe steps into the entrance hall again. “All these years\\nI’ve been really impressed with Fred and George,\\nnicking food from the kitchens — well, it’s not exactly\\ndifficult, is it? They can’t wait to give it away!”\\n“I think this is the best thing that could have\\nhappened to those elves, you know,” said Hermione,\\nleading the way back up the marble staircase. “Dobby\\ncoming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see\\nhow happy he is, being free, and slowly it’ll dawn on\\nthem that they want that too!”\\n“Let’s hope they don’t look too closely at Winky,” said\\nHarry.\\n“Oh shell cheer up,” said Hermione, though she\\nsounded a bit doubtful. “Once the shock’s worn off,\\nand she’s got used to Hogwarts, she’ll see how much\\nbetter off she is without that Crouch man.”\\n“She seems to love him,” said Ron thickly (he had just\\nstarted on a cream cake) .\\n“Doesn’t think much of Bagman, though, does she?”\\nsaid Harry. “Wonder what Crouch says at home about\\nhim?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Probably says he’s not a very good Head of\\nDepartment,” said Hermione, “and let’s face it ... he’s\\ngot a point, hasn’t he?”\\n“I’d still rather work for him than old Crouch,” said\\nRon. “At least Bagman’s got a sense of humor.”\\n“Don’t let Percy hear you saying that,” Hermione said,\\nsmiling slightly.\\n“Yeah, well, Percy wouldn’t want to work for anyone\\nwith a sense of humor, would he?” said Ron, now\\nstarting on a chocolate eclair. “Percy wouldn’t\\nrecognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him\\nwearing Dobby’s tea cozy.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE UNEXPECTED TASK\\n“Potter! Weasley! Will you pay attention?”\\nProfessor McGonagall’s irritated voice cracked like a\\nwhip through the Transfiguration class on Thursday,\\nand Harry and Ron both jumped and looked up.\\nIt was the end of the lesson; they had finished their\\nwork; the guinea fowl they had been changing into\\nguinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on\\nProfessor McGonagall’s desk (Neville’s still had\\nfeathers); they had copied down their homework from\\nthe blackboard (“Describe, with examples, the ways in\\nwhich Transforming Spells must be adapted when\\nperforming Cross-Species Switches”). The bell was due\\nto ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who had\\nbeen having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and\\nGeorge’s fake wands at the back of the class, looked\\nup, Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry, a rubber\\nhaddock.\\n“Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough\\nto act their age,” said Professor McGonagall, with an\\n \\nangry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry’s\\nhaddock drooped and fell silently to the floor — Ron’s\\nparrot’s beak had severed it moments before — “I\\nhave something to say to you all.\\n“The Yule Ball is approaching — a traditional part of\\nthe Tri-wizard Tournament and an opportunity for us\\nto socialize with our foreign guests. Now, the ball will\\nbe open only to fourth years and above — although\\nyou may invite a younger student if you wish — ”\\nLavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil\\nnudged her hard in the ribs, her face working\\nfuriously as she too fought not to giggle. They both\\nlooked around at Harry. Professor McGonagall\\nignored them, which Harry thought was distinctly\\nunfair, as she had just told off him and Ron.\\n“Dress robes will be worn,” Professor McGonagall\\ncontinued, “and the ball will start at eight o’clock on\\nChristmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great\\nHall. Now then — ”\\nProfessor McGonagall stared deliberately around the\\nclass.\\n“The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er\\n— let our hair down,” she said, in a disapproving\\nvoice.\\nLavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand\\npressed hard against her mouth to stifle the sound.\\nHarry could see what was funny this time: Professor\\nMcGonagall, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as\\nthough she had never let her hair down in any sense.\\n“But that does NOT mean,” Professor McGonagall\\nwent on, “that we will be relaxing the standards of\\nbehavior we expect from Hogwarts students. I will be\\n \\nmost seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student\\nembarrasses the school in any way.”\\nThe bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of\\nactivity as everyone packed their bags and swung\\nthem onto their shoulders.\\nProfessor McGonagall called above the noise, “Potter\\n— a word, if you please.”\\nAssuming this had something to do with his headless\\nrubber haddock, Harry proceeded gloomily to the\\nteacher’s desk. Professor McGonagall waited until the\\nrest of the class had gone, and then said, “Potter, the\\nchampions and their partners — ”\\n“What partners?” said Harry.\\nProfessor McGonagall looked suspiciously at him, as\\nthough she thought he was trying to be funny.\\n“Your partners for the Yule Ball, Potter,” she said\\ncoldly. “Your dance partners.”\\nHarry’s insides seemed to curl up and shrivel.\\n“Dance partners?” He felt himself going red. “I don’t\\ndance,” he said quickly.\\n“Oh yes, you do,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.\\n“That’s what I’m telling you. Traditionally, the\\nchampions and their partners open the ball.”\\nHarry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top\\nhat and tails, accompanied by a girl in the sort of\\nfrilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to Uncle\\nVernon’s work parties.\\n“I’m not dancing,” he said.\\n \\n“It is traditional,” said Professor McGonagall firmly.\\n“You are a Hogwarts champion, and you will do what\\nis expected of you as a representative of the school.\\nSo make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.”\\n“But — I don’t — ”\\n“You heard me, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall in\\na very final sort of way.\\nA week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner\\nfor a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a\\nHungarian Horntail. But now that he had done the\\nlatter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to\\nthe ball, he thought he’d rather have another round\\nwith the dragon.\\nHarry had never known so many people to put their\\nnames down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he\\nalways did, of course, because the alternative was\\nusually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always\\nbeen very much in the minority before now. This year,\\nhowever, everyone in the fourth year and above\\nseemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to\\nbe obsessed with the coming ball — or at least all the\\ngirls were, and it was amazing how many girls\\nHogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never\\nquite noticed that before. Girls giggling and\\nwhispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with\\nlaughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly\\ncomparing notes on what they were going to wear on\\nChristmas night. ...\\n“Why do they have to move in packs?” Harry asked\\nRon as a dozen or so girls walked past them,\\nsniggering and staring at Harry. “How’re you\\nsupposed to get one on their own to ask them?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Lasso one?” Ron suggested. “Got any idea who you’re\\ngoing to try?”\\nHarry didn’t answer. He knew perfectly well whom\\nhe’d like to ask, but working up the nerve was\\nsomething else. ... Cho was a year older than he was;\\nshe was very pretty; she was a very good Quidditch\\nplayer, and she was also very popular.\\nRon seemed to know what was going on inside\\nHarry’s head.\\n“Listen, you’re not going to have any trouble. You’re a\\nchampion. You’ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I\\nbet they 11 be queuing up to go with you.”\\nIn tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron\\nhad kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare\\nminimum. Moreover, to Harry’s amazement, he\\nturned out to be quite right.\\nA curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom\\nHarry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to\\nthe ball with her the very next day. Harry was so\\ntaken aback he said no before he’d even stopped to\\nconsider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather\\nhurt, and Harry had to endure Dean’s, Seamus’s, and\\nRon’s taunts about her all through History of Magic.\\nThe following day, two more girls asked him, a second\\nyear and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked as\\nthough she might knock him out if he refused.\\n“She was quite good-looking,” said Ron fairly, after\\nhe’d stopped laughing.\\n“She was a foot taller than me,” said Harry, still\\nunnerved. “Imagine what I’d look like trying to dance\\nwith her.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHermione’s words about Krum kept coming back to\\nhim. “They only like him because he’s famous!” Harry\\ndoubted very much if any of the girls who had asked\\nto be his partner so far would have wanted to go to\\nthe ball with him if he hadn’t been a school\\nchampion. Then he wondered if this would bother\\nhim if Cho asked him.\\nOn the whole, Harry had to admit that even with the\\nembarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him,\\nlife had definitely improved since he had got through\\nthe first task. He wasn’t attracting nearly as much\\nunpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which he\\nsuspected had a lot to do with Cedric — he had an\\nidea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave\\nHarry alone, in gratitude for Harry’s tip-off about the\\ndragons. There seemed to be fewer Support Cedric\\nDiggoryl badges around too. Draco Malfoy, of course,\\nwas still quoting Rita Skeeter’s article to him at every\\npossible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and\\nfewer laughs out of it — and just to heighten Harry’s\\nfeeling of well-being, no story about Hagrid had\\nappeared in the Daily Prophet\\n“She didn’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures,\\nter tell yeh the truth,” Hagrid said, when Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione asked him how his interview with Rita\\nSkeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical\\nCreatures lesson of the term. To their very great relief,\\nHagrid had given up on direct contact with the\\nskrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind\\nhis cabin today, sitting at a trestle table and\\npreparing a fresh selection of food with which to\\ntempt the skrewts.\\n“She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, Harry,”\\nHagrid continued in a low voice. “Well, I told her we’d\\nbeen friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the\\nDursleys. ‘Never had to tell him off in four years?’ she\\n \\nsaid. ‘Never played you up in lessons, has he?’ I told\\nher no, an’ she didn’ seem happy at all. Yeh’d think\\nshe wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry.”\\n“ ’Course she did,” said Harry, throwing lumps of\\ndragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up\\nhis knife to cut some more. “She can’t keep writing\\nabout what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get boring.”\\n“She wants a new angle, Hagrid,” said Ron wisely as\\nhe shelled salamander eggs. “You were supposed to\\nsay Harry’s a mad delinquent!”\\n“But he’s not!” said Hagrid, looking genuinely\\nshocked.\\n“She should’ve interviewed Snape,” said Harry grimly.\\n“He’d give her the goods on me any day. ‘Potter has\\nbeen crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this\\nschool. . . . ’ ”\\n“Said that, did he?” said Hagrid, while Ron and\\nHermione laughed. “Well, yeh might’ve bent a few\\nrules, Harry, bu’ yeh’re all righ’ really, aren’ you?”\\n“Cheers, Hagrid,” said Harry, grinning.\\n“You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day,\\nHagrid?” said Ron.\\n“Though’ I might look in on it, yeah,” said Hagrid\\ngruffly. “Should be a good do, I reckon. You’ll be\\nopenin’ the dancin’, won’ yeh, Harry? Who ’re you\\ntakin’?”\\n“No one, yet,” said Harry, feeling himself going red\\nagain. Hagrid didn’t pursue the subject.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThe last week of term became increasingly boisterous\\nas it progressed. Rumors about the Yule Ball were\\nflying everywhere, though Harry didn’t believe half of\\nthem — for instance, that Dumbledore had bought\\neight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam\\nRosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had\\nbooked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the\\nWeird Sisters were Harry didn’t know, never having\\nhad access to a wizard’s wireless, but he deduced\\nfrom the wild excitement of those who had grown up\\nlistening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network)\\nthat they were a very famous musical group.\\nSome of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick,\\ngave up trying to teach them much when their minds\\nwere so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play\\ngames in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of\\nit talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning\\nCharm Harry had used during the first task of the\\nTriwizard Tournament. Other teachers were not so\\ngenerous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns,\\nfor example, from plowing on through his notes on\\ngoblin rebellions — as Binns hadn’t let his own death\\nstand in the way of continuing to teach, they\\nsupposed a small thing like Christmas wasn’t going to\\nput him off. It was amazing how he could make even\\nbloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as\\nPercy’s cauldron-bottom report. Professors\\nMcGonagall and Moody kept them working until the\\nvery last second of their classes too, and Snape, of\\ncourse, would no sooner let them play games in class\\nthan adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all,\\nhe informed them that he would be testing them on\\npoison antidotes during the last lesson of the term.\\n“Evil, he is,” Ron said bitterly that night in the\\nGryffindor common room. “Springing a test on us on\\nthe last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole\\nload of studying.”\\n \\n“Mmm ... you’re not exactly straining yourself,\\nthough, are you?” said Hermione, looking at him over\\nthe top of her Potions notes. Ron was busy building a\\ncard castle out of his Exploding Snap pack — a much\\nmore interesting pastime than with Muggle cards,\\nbecause of the chance that the whole thing would\\nblow up at any second.\\n“It’s Christmas, Hermione,” said Harry lazily; he was\\nrereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time\\nin an armchair near the fire.\\nHermione looked severely over at him too. “I’d have\\nthought you’d be doing something constructive,\\nHarry, even if you don’t want to learn your antidotes!”\\n“Like what?” Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins\\nof the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle\\nBats Chaser.\\n“That egg!” Hermione hissed.\\n“Come on, Hermione, I’ve got till February the twenty-\\nfourth,” Harry said.\\nHe had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and\\nhadn’t opened it since the celebration party after the\\nfirst task. There were still two and a half months to go\\nuntil he needed to know what all the screechy wailing\\nmeant, after all.\\n“But it might take weeks to work it out!” said\\nHermione. “You’re going to look a real idiot if everyone\\nelse knows what the next task is and you don’t!”\\n“Leave him alone, Hermione, he’s earned a bit of a\\nbreak,” said Ron, and he placed the last two cards on\\ntop of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing\\nhis eyebrows.\\n \\n“Nice look, Ron ... go well with your dress robes, that\\nwill.”\\nIt was Fred and George. They sat down at the table\\nwith Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Ron felt how much\\ndamage had been done.\\n“Ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?” George asked.\\n“No, he’s off delivering a letter,” said Ron. “Why?”\\n“Because George wants to invite him to the ball,” said\\nFred sarcastically.\\n“Because we want to send a letter, you stupid great\\nprat,” said George.\\n“Who d’you two keep writing to, eh?” said Ron.\\n“Nose out, Ron, or I’ll burn that for you too,” said\\nFred, waving his wand threateningly. “So ... you lot\\ngot dates for the ball yet?”\\n“Nope,” said Ron.\\n“Well, you’d better hurry up, mate, or all the good\\nones will be gone,” said Fred.\\n“Who’re you going with, then?” said Ron.\\n“Angelina,” said Fred promptly, without a trace of\\nembarrassment.\\n“What?” said Ron, taken aback. “You’ve already asked\\nher?”\\n“Good point,” said Fred. He turned his head and\\ncalled across the common room, “Oi! Angelina!”\\n \\nAngelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet\\nnear the fire, looked over at him.\\n“What?” she called back.\\n“Want to come to the ball with me?”\\nAngelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.\\n“All right, then,” she said, and she turned back to\\nAlicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on\\nher face.\\n“There you go,” said Fred to Harry and Ron, “piece of\\ncake.”\\nHe got to his feet, yawning, and said, “We’d better use\\na school owl then, George, come on. ...”\\nThey left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and\\nlooked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle\\nat Harry.\\n“We should get a move on, you know ... ask someone.\\nHe’s right. We don’t want to end up with a pair of\\ntrolls.”\\nHermione let out a sputter of indignation.\\n“A pair of . . . what, excuse me?”\\n“Well — you know,” said Ron, shrugging. “I’d rather\\ngo alone than with — with Eloise Midgen, say.”\\n“Her acne’s loads better lately — and she’s really\\nnice!”\\n“Her nose is off-center,” said Ron.\\n \\n“Oh I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically,\\nyou’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have\\nyou, even if she’s completely horrible?”\\n“Er — yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.\\n“I’m going to bed,” Hermione snapped, and she swept\\noff toward the girls’ staircase without another word.\\nThe Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire\\nto impress the visitors from Beauxbatons and\\nDurmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at\\nits best this Christmas. When the decorations went\\nup, Harry noticed that they were the most stunning\\nhe had yet seen inside the school. Everlasting icicles\\nhad been attached to the banisters of the marble\\nstaircase; the usual twelve Christmas trees in the\\nGreat Hall were bedecked with everything from\\nluminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls,\\nand the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing\\ncarols whenever anyone passed them. It was quite\\nsomething to hear “O Come, All Ye Faithful” sung by\\nan empty helmet that only knew half the words.\\nSeveral times, Filch the caretaker had to extract\\nPeeves from inside the armor, where he had taken to\\nhiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of\\nhis own invention, all of which were very rude.\\nAnd still, Harry hadn’t asked Cho to the ball. He and\\nRon were getting very nervous now, though as Harry\\npointed out, Ron would look much less stupid than\\nhe would without a partner; Harry was supposed to\\nbe starting the dancing with the other champions.\\n“I suppose there’s always Moaning Myrtle,” he said\\ngloomily, referring to the ghost who haunted the girls’\\ntoilets on the second floor.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Harry — we’ve just got to grit our teeth and do it,”\\nsaid Ron on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested\\nthey were planning the storming of an impregnable\\nfortress. “When we get back to the common room\\ntonight, we’ll both have partners — agreed?”\\n“Er ... okay,” said Harry.\\nBut every time he glimpsed Cho that day — during\\nbreak, and then lunchtime, and once on the way to\\nHistory of Magic — she was surrounded by friends.\\nDidn’t she ever go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps\\nambush her as she was going into a bathroom? But\\nno — she even seemed to go there with an escort of\\nfour or five girls. Yet if he didn’t do it soon, she was\\nbound to have been asked by somebody else.\\nHe found it hard to concentrate on Snape’s Potions\\ntest, and consequently forgot to add the key\\ningredient — a bezoar — meaning that he received\\nbottom marks. He didn’t care, though; he was too\\nbusy screwing up his courage for what he was about\\nto do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and\\nhurried to the dungeon door.\\n“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to Ron and\\nHermione, and he dashed off upstairs.\\nHe’d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was\\nall. ... He hurried off through the packed corridors\\nlooking for her, and (rather sooner than he had\\nexpected) he found her, emerging from a Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts lesson.\\n“Er — Cho? Could I have a word with you?”\\nGiggling should be made illegal, Harry thought\\nfuriously, as all the girls around Cho started doing it.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nShe didn’t, though. She said, “Okay,” and followed\\nhim out of earshot of her classmates.\\nHarry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a\\nweird lurch as though he had missed a step going\\ndownstairs.\\n“Er,” he said.\\nHe couldn’t ask her. He couldn’t. But he had to. Cho\\nstood there looking puzzled, watching him.\\nThe words came out before Harry had quite got his\\ntongue around them.\\n“Wangoballwime?”\\n“Sorry?” said Cho.\\n“D’you — d’you want to go to the ball with me?” said\\nHarry. Why did he have to go red now? Why ?\\n“Oh!” said Cho, and she went red too. “Oh Harry, I’m\\nreally sorry,” and she truly looked it. “I’ve already said\\nI’ll go with someone else.”\\n“Oh,” said Harry.\\nIt was odd; a moment before his insides had been\\nwrithing like snakes, but suddenly he didn’t seem to\\nhave any insides at all.\\n“Oh okay,” he said, “no problem.”\\n“I’m really sorry,” she said again.\\n“That’s okay,” said Harry.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThey stood there looking at each other, and then Cho\\nsaid, “Well — ”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry.\\n“Well, ’bye,” said Cho, still very red. She walked away.\\nHarry called after her, before he could stop himself.\\n“Who ’re you going with?”\\n“Oh — Cedric,” she said. “Cedric Diggory.”\\n“Oh right,” said Harry.\\nHis insides had come back again. It felt as though\\nthey had been filled with lead in their absence.\\nCompletely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly\\nback up to Gryffindor Tower, Cho’s voice echoing in\\nhis ears with every step he took. “ Cedric — Cedric\\nDiggory.” He had been starting to quite like Cedric —\\nprepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten\\nhim at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular,\\nand nearly everyone’s favorite champion. Now he\\nsuddenly realized that Cedric was in fact a useless\\npretty boy who didn’t have enough brains to fill an\\neggcup.\\n“Fairy lights,” he said dully to the Fat Lady — the\\npassword had been changed the previous day.\\n“Yes, indeed, dear!” she trilled, straightening her new\\ntinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him.\\nEntering the common room, Harry looked around,\\nand to his surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen-faced in\\na distant corner. Ginny was sitting with him, talking\\nto him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.\\n \\n“What’s up, Ron?” said Harry, joining them.\\nRon looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his\\nface.\\n“Why did I do it?” he said wildly. “I don’t know what\\nmade me do it!”\\n“What?” said Harry.\\n“He — er — just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the\\nball with him,” said Ginny. She looked as though she\\nwas fighting back a smile, but she kept patting Ron’s\\narm sympathetically.\\n“You what?” said Harry.\\n“I don’t know what made me do it!” Ron gasped again.\\n“What was I playing at? There were people — all\\naround — I’ve gone mad — everyone watching! I was\\njust walking past her in the entrance hall — she was\\nstanding there talking to Diggory — and it sort of\\ncame over me — and I asked her!”\\nRon moaned and put his face in his hands. He kept\\ntalking, though the words were barely\\ndistinguishable.\\n“She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something.\\nDidn’t even answer. And then — I dunno — I just sort\\nof came to my senses and ran for it.”\\n“She’s part veela,” said Harry. “You were right — her\\ngrandmother was one. It wasn’t your fault, I bet you\\njust walked past when she was turning on the old\\ncharm for Diggory and got a blast of it — but she was\\nwasting her time. He’s going with Cho Chang.”\\nRon looked up.\\n \\n“I asked her to go with me just now,” Harry said dully,\\n“and she told me.”\\nGinny had suddenly stopped smiling.\\n“This is mad,” said Ron. “We’re the only ones left who\\nhaven’t got anyone — well, except Neville. Hey —\\nguess who he asked? Hermionel”\\n“ What?” said Harry, completely distracted by this\\nstartling news.\\n“Yeah, I know!” said Ron, some of the color coming\\nback into his face as he started to laugh. “He told me\\nafter Potions! Said she’s always been really nice,\\nhelping him out with work and stuff — but she told\\nhim she was already going with someone. Ha! As if!\\nShe just didn’t want to go with Neville ... I mean, who\\nwould?”\\n“Don’t!” said Ginny, annoyed. “Don’t laugh — ”\\nJust then Hermione climbed in through the portrait\\nhole.\\n“Why weren’t you two at dinner?” she said, coming\\nover to join them.\\n“Because — oh shut up laughing, you two — because\\nthey’ve both just been turned down by girls they\\nasked to the ball!” said Ginny.\\nThat shut Harry and Ron up.\\n“Thanks a bunch, Ginny,” said Ron sourly.\\n“All the good-looking ones taken, Ron?” said\\nHermione loftily. “Eloise Midgen starting to look quite\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\npretty now, is she? Well, I’m sure you’ll find someone\\nsomewhere who’ll have you.”\\nBut Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly\\nseeing her in a whole new light.\\n“Hermione, Neville’s right — you are a girl. ...”\\n“Oh well spotted,” she said acidly.\\n“Well — you can come with one of us!”\\n“No, I can’t,” snapped Hermione.\\n“Oh come on,” he said impatiently, “we need partners,\\nwe’re going to look really stupid if we haven’t got any,\\neveryone else has ...”\\n“I can’t come with you,” said Hermione, now blushing,\\n“because I’m already going with someone.”\\n“No, you’re not!” said Ron. “You just said that to get\\nrid of Neville!”\\n“Oh did I?” said Hermione, and her eyes flashed\\ndangerously. “Just because it’s taken you three years\\nto notice, Ron, doesn’t mean no one else has spotted\\nI’m a girl!”\\nRon stared at her. Then he grinned again.\\n“Okay, okay, we know you’re a girl,” he said. “That\\ndo? Will you come now?”\\n“I’ve already told you!” Hermione said very angrily.\\n“I’m going with someone else!”\\nAnd she stormed off toward the girls’ dormitories\\nagain.\\n \\n“She’s lying,” said Ron flatly, watching her go.\\n“She’s not,” said Ginny quietly.\\n“Who is it then?” said Ron sharply.\\n“I’m not telling you, it’s her business,” said Ginny.\\n“Right,” said Ron, who looked extremely put out, “this\\nis getting stupid. Ginny, you can go with Harry, and\\nI’ll just—”\\n“I can’t,” said Ginny, and she went scarlet too. “I’m\\ngoing with — with Neville. He asked me when\\nHermione said no, and I thought ... well ... I’m not\\ngoing to be able to go otherwise, I’m not in fourth\\nyear.” She looked extremely miserable. “I think I’ll go\\nand have dinner,” she said, and she got up and\\nwalked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed.\\nRon goggled at Harry.\\n“What’s got into them?” he demanded.\\nBut Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come\\nin through the portrait hole. The time had come for\\ndrastic action.\\n“Wait here,” he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked\\nstraight up to Parvati, and said, “Parvati? Will you go\\nto the ball with me?”\\nParvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for\\nthem to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of\\nhis robes.\\n“Yes, all right then,” she said finally, blushing\\nfuriously.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, in relief. “Lavender — will you\\ngo with Ron?”\\n“She’s going with Seamus,” said Parvati, and the pair\\nof them giggled harder than ever.\\nHarry sighed.\\n“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with Ron?” he\\nsaid, lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn’t hear.\\n“What about Hermione Granger?” said Parvati.\\n“She’s going with someone else.”\\nParvati looked astonished.\\n“Ooooh — who?” she said keenly.\\nHarry shrugged. “No idea,” he said. “So what about\\nRon?”\\n“Well ...” said Parvati slowly, “I suppose my sister\\nmight ... Padma, you know ... in Ravenclaw. I’ll ask\\nher if you like.”\\n“Yeah, that would be great,” said Harry. “Let me\\nknow, will you?”\\nAnd he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball\\nwas a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping\\nvery much that Padma Patil’s nose was dead center.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE YULE BALL\\nDespite the very heavy load of homework that the\\nfourth years had been given for the holidays, Harry\\nwas in no mood to work when term ended, and spent\\nthe week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as\\nfully as possible along with everyone else. Gryffindor\\nTower was hardly less crowded now than during\\nterm-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as\\nits inhabitants were being so much rowdier than\\nusual. Fred and George had had a great success with\\ntheir Canary Creams, and for the first couple of days\\nof the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all\\nover the place. Before long, however, all the\\nGryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else\\noffered them with extreme caution, in case it had a\\nCanary Cream concealed in the center, and George\\nconfided to Harry that he and Fred were now working\\non developing something else. Harry made a mental\\nnote never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred\\nand George in future. He still hadn’t forgotten Dudley\\nand the Ton-Tongue Toffee.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nSnow was falling thickly upon the castle and its\\ngrounds now. The pale blue Beauxbatons carriage\\nlooked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the\\niced gingerbread house that was Hagrid’s cabin, while\\nthe Durmstrang ship’s portholes were glazed with ice,\\nthe rigging white with frost. The house-elves down in\\nthe kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of\\nrich, warming stews and savory puddings, and only\\nFleur Delacour seemed to be able to find anything to\\ncomplain about.\\n“It is too ’eavy, all zis ’Ogwarts food,” they heard her\\nsaying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her\\none evening (Ron skulking behind Harry, keen not to\\nbe spotted by Fleur). “I will not fit into my dress\\nrobes!”\\n“Oooh there’s a tragedy,” Hermione snapped as Fleur\\nwent out into the entrance hall. “She really thinks a\\nlot of herself, that one, doesn’t she?”\\n“Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?”\\nsaid Ron.\\nHe kept springing this question on her, hoping to\\nstartle her into a response by asking it when she least\\nexpected it. However, Hermione merely frowned and\\nsaid, “I’m not telling you, you’ll just make fun of me.”\\n“You’re joking, Weasley!” said Malfoy, behind them.\\n“You’re not telling me someone’s asked that to the\\nball? Not the long-molared Mudblood?”\\nHarry and Ron both whipped around, but Hermione\\nsaid loudly, waving to somebody over Malfoy’s\\nshoulder, “Hello, Professor Moody!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nMalfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking\\nwildly around for Moody, but he was still up at the\\nstaff table, finishing his stew.\\n“Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?” said\\nHermione scathingly, and she, Harry, and Ron went\\nup the marble staircase laughing heartily.\\n“Hermione,” said Ron, looking sideways at her,\\nsuddenly frowning, “your teeth ...”\\n“What about them?” she said.\\n“Well, they’re different ... I’ve just noticed. ...”\\n“Of course they are — did you expect me to keep\\nthose fangs Malfoy gave me?”\\n“No, I mean, they’re different to how they were before\\nhe put that hex on you. ... They’re all ... straight and\\n— and normal-sized.”\\nHermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and\\nHarry noticed it too: It was a very different smile from\\nthe one he remembered.\\n“Well ... when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get\\nthem shrunk, she held up a mirror and told me to\\nstop her when they were back to how they normally\\nwere,” she said. “And I just ... let her carry on a bit.”\\nShe smiled even more widely. “Mum and Dad won’t be\\ntoo pleased. I’ve been trying to persuade them to let\\nme shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry\\non with my braces. You know, they’re dentists, they\\njust don’t think teeth and magic should — look!\\nPigwidgeon’s back!”\\nRon’s tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the\\nicicle-laden banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to\\n \\nhis leg. People passing him were pointing and\\nlaughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and\\nsaid, “Oh look at the weeny owl! Isn’t he cute?”\\n“Stupid little feathery git!” Ron hissed, hurrying up\\nthe stairs and snatching up Pigwidgeon. “You bring\\nletters to the addressee! You don’t hang around\\nshowing off!”\\nPigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over\\nRon’s fist. The third-year girls all looked very\\nshocked.\\n“Clear off!” Ron snapped at them, waving the fist\\nholding Pigwidgeon, who hooted more happily than\\never as he soared through the air. “Here — take it,\\nHarry,” Ron added in an undertone as the third-year\\ngirls scuttled away looking scandalized. He pulled\\nSirius’s reply off Pigwidgeon’s leg, Harry pocketed it,\\nand they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it.\\nEveryone in the common room was much too busy in\\nletting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone\\nelse was up to. Ron, Harry, and Hermione sat apart\\nfrom everyone else by a dark window that was\\ngradually filling up with snow, and Harry read out:\\nDear Harry,\\nCongratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever\\nput your name in that goblet shouldn’t be feeling too\\nhappy right now! I was going to suggest a\\nConjunctivitis Curse, as a dragon’s eyes are its\\nweakest point — “That’s what Krum did!” Hermione\\nwhispered — but your way was better, I’m impressed.\\nDon’t get complacent, though, Harry. You’ve only done\\none task; whoever put you in for the tournament’s got\\nplenty more opportunity if they’re trying to hurt you.\\n \\nKeep your eyes open — particularly when the person\\nwe discussed is around — and concentrate on keeping\\nyourself out of trouble.\\nKeep in touch, I still want to hear about anything\\nunusual.\\nSirius\\n“He sounds exactly like Moody,” said Harry quietly,\\ntucking the letter away again inside his robes. “\\n‘Constant vigilance!’ You’d think I walk around with\\nmy eyes shut, banging off the walls. ...”\\n“But he’s right, Harry,” said Hermione, “you have still\\ngot two tasks to do. You really ought to have a look at\\nthat egg, you know, and start working out what it\\nmeans. ...”\\n“Hermione, he’s got ages!” snapped Ron. “Want a\\ngame of chess, Harry?”\\n“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. Then, spotting the look on\\nHermione ’s face, he said, “Come on, how’m I\\nsupposed to concentrate with all this noise going on?\\nI won’t even be able to hear the egg over this lot.”\\n“Oh I suppose not,” she sighed, and she sat down to\\nwatch their chess match, which culminated in an\\nexciting checkmate of Ron’s, involving a couple of\\nrecklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop.\\nHarry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day.\\nWondering what had caused his abrupt return to\\nconsciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw\\nsomething with very large, round, green eyes staring\\nback at him in the darkness, so close they were\\nalmost nose to nose.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Dobbyl” Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf\\nso fast he almost fell out of bed. “Don’t do that!”\\n“Dobby is sorry, sir!” squeaked Dobby anxiously,\\njumping backward with his long fingers over his\\nmouth. “Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter\\n‘Merry Christmas’ and bring him a present, sir! Harry\\nPotter did say Dobby could come and see him\\nsometimes, sir!”\\n“It’s okay,” said Harry, still breathing rather faster\\nthan usual, while his heart rate returned to normal.\\n“Just — just prod me or something in future, all right,\\ndon’t bend over me like that. ...”\\nHarry pulled back the curtains around his four-\\nposter, took his glasses from his bedside table, and\\nput them on. His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus,\\nDean, and Neville. All of them were peering through\\nthe gaps in their own hangings, heavy-eyed and\\ntousle-haired.\\n“Someone attacking you, Harry?” Seamus asked\\nsleepily.\\n“No, it’s just Dobby,” Harry muttered. “Go back to\\nsleep.”\\n“Nah ... presents!” said Seamus, spotting the large\\npile at the foot of his bed. Ron, Dean, and Neville\\ndecided that now they were awake they might as well\\nget down to some present-opening too. Harry turned\\nback to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next\\nto Harry’s bed, still looking worried that he had upset\\nHarry. There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop\\non top of his tea cozy.\\n“Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?” he\\nsqueaked tentatively.\\n \\n“ ’Course you can,” said Harry. “Er ... I’ve got\\nsomething for you too.”\\nIt was a lie; he hadn’t bought anything for Dobby at\\nall, but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a\\nparticularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks. They\\nwere his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had\\nonce belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were\\nextra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to\\ncushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He\\npulled out the Sneakoscope and handed the socks to\\nDobby, saying, “Sorry, I forgot to wrap them. ...”\\nBut Dobby was utterly delighted.\\n“Socks are Dobby’s favorite, favorite clothes, sir!” he\\nsaid, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle\\nVernon’s. “I has seven now, sir. ... But sir ...” he said,\\nhis eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to\\ntheir highest extent, so that they reached to the\\nbottom of his shorts, “they has made a mistake in the\\nshop, Harry Potter, they is giving you two the same!”\\n“Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn’t spot that?” said\\nRon, grinning over from his own bed, which was now\\nstrewn with wrapping paper. “Tell you what, Dobby —\\nhere you go — take these two, and you can mix them\\nup properly. And here’s your sweater.”\\nHe threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just\\nunwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs.\\nWeasley had sent. Dobby looked quite overwhelmed.\\n“Sir is very kind!” he squeaked, his eyes brimming\\nwith tears again, bowing deeply to Ron. “Dobby knew\\nsir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter’s\\ngreatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was\\nalso as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“They’re only socks,” said Ron, who had gone slightly\\npink around the ears, though he looked rather\\npleased all the same. “Wow, Harry — ” He had just\\nopened Harry’s present, a Chudley Cannon hat.\\n“Cool!” He jammed it onto his head, where it clashed\\nhorribly with his hair.\\nDobby now handed Harry a small package, which\\nturned out to be — socks.\\n“Dobby is making them himself, sir!” the elf said\\nhappily. “He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!”\\nThe left sock was bright red and had a pattern of\\nbroomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a\\npattern of Snitches.\\n“They’re ... they’re really ... well, thanks, Dobby,” said\\nHarry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes\\nto leak with happiness again.\\n“Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making\\nChristmas dinner in the kitchens!” said Dobby, and\\nhe hurried out of the dormitory, waving good-bye to\\nRon and the others as he passed.\\nHarry’s other presents were much more satisfactory\\nthan Dobby’s odd socks — with the obvious exception\\nof the Dursleys’, which consisted of a single tissue, an\\nall-time low — Harry supposed they too were\\nremembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee. Hermione had\\ngiven Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain\\nand Ireland ; Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs;\\nSirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock\\nany lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box\\nof sweets including all Harry’s favorites: Bertie Bott’s\\nEvery Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble’s Best\\nBlowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees. There was also,\\nof course, Mrs. Weasley’s usual package, including a\\n \\nnew sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it —\\nHarry supposed Charlie had told her all about the\\nHorntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince\\npies.\\nHarry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common\\nroom, and they went down to breakfast together. They\\nspent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower, where\\neveryone was enjoying their presents, then returned\\nto the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which\\nincluded at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas\\npuddings, and large piles of Cribbage’s Wizarding\\nCrackers.\\nThey went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the\\nsnow was untouched except for the deep channels\\nmade by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students\\non their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to\\nwatch Harry and the Weasleys’ snowball fight rather\\nthan join in, and at five o’clock said she was going\\nback upstairs to get ready for the ball.\\n“What, you need three hours?” said Ron, looking at\\nher incredulously and paying for his lapse in\\nconcentration when a large snowball, thrown by\\nGeorge, hit him hard on the side of the head. “Who ’re\\nyou going with?” he yelled after Hermione, but she\\njust waved and disappeared up the stone steps into\\nthe castle.\\nThere was no Christmas tea today, as the ball\\nincluded a feast, so at seven o’clock, when it had\\nbecome hard to aim properly, the others abandoned\\ntheir snowball fight and trooped back to the common\\nroom. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her\\nfriend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely\\ntipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the\\nbottom of her picture.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Lairy fights, that’s the one!” she giggled when they\\ngave the password, and she swung forward to let\\nthem inside.\\nHarry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into\\ntheir dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them\\nlooking very self-conscious, but none as much as\\nRon, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the\\ncorner with an appalled look on his face. There was\\njust no getting around the fact that his robes looked\\nmore like a dress than anything else. In a desperate\\nattempt to make them look more manly, he used a\\nSevering Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly\\nwell; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn’t\\ndone a very neat job, and the edges still looked\\ndepressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.\\n“I still can’t work out how you two got the best-\\nlooking girls in the year,” muttered Dean.\\n“Animal magnetism,” said Ron gloomily, pulling stray\\nthreads out of his cuffs.\\nThe common room looked strange, full of people\\nwearing different colors instead of the usual mass of\\nblack. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the\\nstairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of\\nshocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with\\ngold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists.\\nHarry was relieved to see that she wasn’t giggling.\\n“You — er — look nice,” he said awkwardly.\\n“Thanks,” she said. “Padma’s going to meet you in the\\nentrance hall,” she added to Ron.\\n“Right,” said Ron, looking around. “Where’s\\nHermione?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nParvati shrugged. “Shall we go down then, Harry?”\\n“Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the\\ncommon room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed\\nhim on the way out of the portrait hole.\\nThe entrance hall was packed with students too, all\\nmilling around waiting for eight o’clock, when the\\ndoors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Those\\npeople who were meeting partners from different\\nHouses were edging through the crowd trying to find\\none another. Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led\\nher over to Harry and Ron.\\n“Hi,” said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as\\nParvati in robes of bright turquoise. She didn’t look\\ntoo enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner,\\nthough; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and\\nsleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and\\ndown.\\n“Hi,” said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around\\nat the crowd. “Oh no ...”\\nHe bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry,\\nbecause Fleur Delacour was passing, looking\\nstunning in robes of silver-gray satin, and\\naccompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch captain,\\nRoger Davies. When they had disappeared, Ron stood\\nstraight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.\\n“Where is Hermione?” he said again.\\nA group of Slytherins came up the steps from their\\ndungeon common room. Malfoy was in front; he was\\nwearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar,\\nwhich in Harry’s opinion made him look like a vicar.\\nPansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was\\nclutching Malfoy’s arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both\\n \\nwearing green; they resembled moss-colored boulders,\\nand neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had\\nmanaged to find a partner.\\nThe oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to\\nlook as the Durmstrang students entered with\\nProfessor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the\\nparty, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes\\nHarry didn’t know. Over their heads he saw that an\\narea of lawn right in front of the castle had been\\ntransformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights —\\nmeaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting\\nin the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and\\nfluttering over the statues of what seemed to be\\nFather Christmas and his reindeer.\\nThen Professor McGonagall’s voice called,\\n“Champions over here, please!”\\nParvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and\\nHarry said “See you in a minute” to Ron and Padma\\nand walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to\\nlet them through. Professor McGonagall, who was\\nwearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a\\nrather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim of her\\nhat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while\\neveryone else went inside; they were to enter the\\nGreat Hall in procession when the rest of the students\\nhad sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies\\nstationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked\\nso stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a\\npartner that he could hardly take his eyes off her.\\nCedric and Cho were close to Harry too; he looked\\naway from them so he wouldn’t have to talk to them.\\nHis eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw\\ndropped.\\nIt was Hermione.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBut she didn’t look like Hermione at all. She had done\\nsomething with her hair; it was no longer bushy but\\nsleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot\\nat the back of her head. She was wearing robes made\\nof a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was\\nholding herself differently, somehow — or maybe it\\nwas merely the absence of the twenty or so books she\\nusually had slung over her back. She was also\\nsmiling — rather nervously, it was true — but the\\nreduction in the size of her front teeth was more\\nnoticeable than ever; Harry couldn’t understand how\\nhe hadn’t spotted it before.\\n“Hi, Harry!” she said. “Hi, Parvati!”\\nParvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering\\ndisbelief. She wasn’t the only one either; when the\\ndoors to the Great Hall opened, Krum’s fan club from\\nthe library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of\\ndeepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as\\nshe walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn’t seem\\nto be able to find an insult to throw at her. Ron,\\nhowever, walked right past Hermione without looking\\nat her.\\nOnce everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor\\nMcGonagall told the champions and their partners to\\nget in line in pairs and to follow her. They did so, and\\neveryone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered\\nand started walking up toward a large round table at\\nthe top of the Hall, where the judges were sitting.\\nThe walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling\\nsilver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe\\nand ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The House\\ntables had vanished; instead, there were about a\\nhundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about\\na dozen people.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry concentrated on not tripping over his feet.\\nParvati seemed to be enjoying herself; she was\\nbeaming around at everybody, steering Harry so\\nforcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog\\nshe was putting through its paces. He caught sight of\\nRon and Padma as he neared the top table. Ron was\\nwatching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes. Padma\\nwas looking sulky.\\nDumbledore smiled happily as the champions\\napproached the top table, but Karkaroff wore an\\nexpression remarkably like Ron’s as he watched\\nKrum and Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman,\\ntonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow\\nstars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the\\nstudents; and Madame Maxime, who had changed\\nher usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of\\nlavender silk, was applauding them politely. But Mr.\\nCrouch, Harry suddenly realized, was not there. The\\nfifth seat at the table was occupied by Percy Weasley.\\nWhen the champions and their partners reached the\\ntable, Percy drew out the empty chair beside him,\\nstaring pointedly at Harry. Harry took the hint and\\nsat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new,\\nnavy-blue dress robes and an expression of such\\nsmugness that Harry thought it ought to be fined.\\n“I’ve been promoted,” Percy said before Harry could\\neven ask, and from his tone, he might have been\\nannouncing his election as supreme ruler of the\\nuniverse. “I’m now Mr. Crouch’s personal assistant,\\nand I’m here representing him.”\\n“Why didn’t he come?” Harry asked. He wasn’t looking\\nforward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all\\nthrough dinner.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n‘Tm afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn’t well, not well at all.\\nHasn’t been right since the World Cup. Hardly\\nsurprising — overwork. He’s not as young as he was\\n— though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind\\nremains as great as it ever was. But the World Cup\\nwas a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then, Mr.\\nCrouch suffered a huge personal shock with the\\nmisbehavior of that house-elf of his, Blinky, or\\nwhatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her\\nimmediately afterward, but — well, as I say, he’s\\ngetting on, he needs looking after, and I think he’s\\nfound a definite drop in his home comforts since she\\nleft. And then we had the tournament to arrange, and\\nthe aftermath of the Cup to deal with — that revolting\\nSkeeter woman buzzing around — no, poor man, he’s\\nhaving a well earned, quiet Christmas. I’m just glad\\nhe knew he had someone he could rely upon to take\\nhis place.”\\nHarry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch\\nhad stopped calling Percy “Weatherby” yet, but\\nresisted the temptation.\\nThere was no food as yet on the glittering golden\\nplates, but small menus were lying in front of each of\\nthem. Harry picked his up uncertainly and looked\\naround — there were no waiters. Dumbledore,\\nhowever, looked carefully down at his own menu,\\nthen said very clearly to his plate, “Pork chops!”\\nAnd pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of\\nthe table placed their orders with their plates too.\\nHarry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt\\nabout this new and more complicated method of\\ndining — surely it meant plenty of extra work for the\\nhouse-elves? — but for once, Hermione didn’t seem to\\nbe thinking about S.P.E.W. She was deep in talk with\\nViktor Krum and hardly seemed to notice what she\\nwas eating.\\n \\nIt now occurred to Harry that he had never actually\\nheard Krum speak before, but he was certainly\\ntalking now, and very enthusiastically at that.\\n“Veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as\\ncomfortable, I am thinking,” he was telling Hermione.\\n“Ve have just four floors, and the fires are lit only for\\nmagical purposes. But ve have grounds larger even\\nthan these — though in vinter, ve have very little\\ndaylight, so ve are not enjoying them. But in summer\\nve are flying every day, over the lakes and the\\nmountains — ”\\n“Now, now, Viktor!” said Karkaroff with a laugh that\\ndidn’t reach his cold eyes, “don’t go giving away\\nanything else, now, or your charming friend will know\\nexactly where to find us!”\\nDumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. “Igor, all this\\nsecrecy ... one would almost think you didn’t want\\nvisitors.”\\n“Well, Dumbledore,” said Karkaroff, displaying his\\nyellowing teeth to their fullest extent, “we are all\\nprotective of our private domains, are we not? Do we\\nnot jealously guard the halls of learning that have\\nbeen entrusted to us? Are we not right to be proud\\nthat we alone know our school’s secrets, and right to\\nprotect them?”\\n“Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all\\nHogwarts’ secrets, Igor,” said Dumbledore amicably.\\n“Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong\\nturning on the way to the bathroom and found myself\\nin a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen\\nbefore, containing a really rather magnificent\\ncollection of chamber pots. When I went back to\\ninvestigate more closely, I discovered that the room\\nhad vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it.\\n \\nPossibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the\\nmorning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon\\n— or when the seeker has an exceptionally full\\nbladder.”\\nHarry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy\\nfrowned, but Harry could have sworn Dumbledore\\nhad given him a very small wink.\\nMeanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the\\nHogwarts decorations to Roger Davies.\\n“Zis is nothing,” she said dismissively, looking around\\nat the sparkling walls of the Great Hall. “At ze Palace\\nof Beauxbatons, we ’ave ice sculptures all around ze\\ndining chamber at Chreestmas. Zey do not melt, of\\ncourse . . . zey are like ’uge statues of diamond,\\nglittering around ze place. And ze food is seemply\\nsuperb. And we ’ave choirs of wood nymphs, ’oo\\nserenade us as we eat. We ’ave none of zis ugly armor\\nin ze ’alls, and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into\\nBeauxbatons, ’e would be expelled like zat.” She\\nslapped her hand onto the table impatiently.\\nRoger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed\\nlook on his face, and he kept missing his mouth with\\nhis fork. Harry had the impression that Davies was\\ntoo busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was\\nsaying.\\n“Absolutely right,” he said quickly, slapping his own\\nhand down on the table in imitation of Fleur. “Like\\nthat. Yeah.”\\nHarry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at\\none of the other staff tables; he was back in his\\nhorrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top\\ntable. Harry saw him give a small wave, and looking\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\naround, saw Madame Maxime return it, her opals\\nglittering in the candlelight.\\nHermione was now teaching Krum to say her name\\nproperly; he kept calling her “Hermy-own.”\\n“Her-my-oh-nee,” she said slowly and clearly.\\n“Herm-own-ninny.”\\n“Close enough,” she said, catching Harry’s eye and\\ngrinning.\\nWhen all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore\\nstood up and asked the students to do the same.\\nThen, with a wave of his wand, all the tables zoomed\\nback along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then\\nhe conjured a raised platform into existence along the\\nright wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a\\ncello, and some bagpipes were set upon it.\\nThe Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to\\nwildly enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely\\nhairy and dressed in black robes that had been\\nartfully ripped and torn. They picked up their\\ninstruments, and Harry, who had been so interested\\nin watching them that he had almost forgotten what\\nwas coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all\\nthe other tables had gone out, and that the other\\nchampions and their partners were standing up.\\n“Come on!” Parvati hissed. “We’re supposed to dance!”\\nHarry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up.\\nThe Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune;\\nHarry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor,\\ncarefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye (he could see\\nSeamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering), and\\nnext moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed\\n \\none around her waist, and was holding the other\\ntightly in hers.\\nIt wasn’t as bad as it could have been, Harry thought,\\nrevolving slowly on the spot (Parvati was steering) . He\\nkept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching\\npeople, and very soon many of them too had come\\nonto the dance floor, so that the champions were no\\nlonger the center of attention. Neville and Ginny were\\ndancing nearby — he could see Ginny wincing\\nfrequently as Neville trod on her feet — and\\nDumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He\\nwas so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat\\nbarely tickled her chin; however, she moved very\\ngracefully for a woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody was\\ndoing an extremely ungainly two-step with Professor\\nSinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg.\\n“Nice socks, Potter,” Moody growled as he passed, his\\nmagical eye staring through Harry’s robes.\\n“Oh — yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for\\nme,” said Harry, grinning.\\n“He is so creepy\\\\” Parvati whispered as Moody\\nclunked away. “I don’t think that eye should be\\nallowed]”\\nHarry heard the final, quavering note from the\\nbagpipe with relief. The Weird Sisters stopped playing,\\napplause filled the hall once more, and Harry let go of\\nParvati at once.\\n“Let’s sit down, shall we?”\\n“Oh — but — this is a really good one!” Parvati said\\nas the Weird Sisters struck up a new song, which was\\nmuch faster.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“No, I don’t like it,” Harry lied, and he led her away\\nfrom the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who\\nwere dancing so exhuberantly that people around\\nthem were backing away in fear of injury, and over to\\nthe table where Ron and Padma were sitting.\\n“How’s it going?” Harry asked Ron, sitting down and\\nopening a bottle of butterbeer.\\nRon didn’t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and\\nKrum, who were dancing nearby. Padma was sitting\\nwith her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in\\ntime to the music. Every now and then she threw a\\ndisgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring\\nher. Parvati sat down on Harry’s other side, crossed\\nher arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked\\nto dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.\\n“You don’t mind, do you, Harry?” Parvati said.\\n“What?” said Harry, who was now watching Cho and\\nCedric.\\n“Oh never mind,” snapped Parvati, and she went off\\nwith the boy from Beauxbatons. When the song\\nended, she did not return.\\nHermione came over and sat down in Parvati’s empty\\nchair. She was a bit pink in the face from dancing.\\n“Hi,” said Harry. Ron didn’t say anything.\\n“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said Hermione, fanning herself with\\nher hand. “Viktor’s just gone to get some drinks.”\\nRon gave her a withering look. “Viktor?” he said.\\n“Hasn’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHermione looked at him in surprise. “What’s up with\\nyou?” she said.\\n“If you don’t know,” said Ron scathingly, “I’m not\\ngoing to tell you.”\\nHermione stared at him, then at Harry, who\\nshrugged.\\n“Ron, what — ?”\\n“He’s from Durmstrang!” spat Ron. “He’s competing\\nagainst Harry! Against Hogwarts! You — you’re — ”\\nRon was obviously casting around for words strong\\nenough to describe Hermione ’s crime, “ fraternizing\\nwith the enemy, that’s what you’re doing!”\\nHermione’s mouth fell open.\\n“Don’t be so stupid!” she said after a moment. “The\\nenemy\\\\ Honestly — who was the one who was all\\nexcited when they saw him arrive? Who was the one\\nwho wanted his autograph? Who’s got a model of him\\nup in their dormitory?”\\nRon chose to ignore this. “I s’pose he asked you to\\ncome with him while you were both in the library?”\\n“Yes, he did,” said Hermione, the pink patches on her\\ncheeks glowing more brightly. “So what?”\\n“What happened — trying to get him to join spew,\\nwere you?”\\n“No, I wasn’t! If you really want to know, he — he said\\nhe’d been coming up to the library every day to try\\nand talk to me, but he hadn’t been able to pluck up\\nthe courage!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHermione said this very quickly, and blushed so\\ndeeply that she was the same color as Parvati’s robes.\\n“Yeah, well — that’s his story,” said Ron nastily.\\n“And what’s that supposed to mean?”\\n“Obvious, isn’t it? He’s Karkaroff’s student, isn’t he?\\nHe knows who you hang around with. ... He’s just\\ntrying to get closer to Harry — get inside information\\non him — or get near enough to jinx him — ”\\nHermione looked as though Ron had slapped her.\\nWhen she spoke, her voice quivered.\\n“For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single\\nthing about Harry, not one — ”\\nRon changed tack at the speed of light.\\n“Then he’s hoping you’ll help him find out what his\\negg means! I suppose you’ve been putting your heads\\ntogether during those cozy little library sessions — ”\\n“I’d never help him work out that egg!” said Hermione,\\nlooking outraged. “Never. How could you say\\nsomething like that — I want Harry to win the\\ntournament, Harry knows that, don’t you, Harry?”\\n“You’ve got a funny way of showing it,” sneered Ron.\\n“This whole tournament’s supposed to be about\\ngetting to know foreign wizards and making friends\\nwith them!” said Hermione hotly.\\n“No it isn’t!” shouted Ron. “It’s about winning!”\\nPeople were starting to stare at them.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Ron,” said Harry quietly, “I haven’t got a problem\\nwith Hermione coming with Krum — ”\\nBut Ron ignored Harry too.\\n“Why don’t you go and find Vicky, he’ll be wondering\\nwhere you are,” said Ron.\\n“Don’t call him Vickyl”\\nHermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across\\nthe dance floor, disappearing into the crowd. Ron\\nwatched her go with a mixture of anger and\\nsatisfaction on his face.\\n“Are you going to ask me to dance at all?” Padma\\nasked him.\\n“No,” said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.\\n“Fine,” snapped Padma, and she got up and went to\\njoin Parvati and the Beauxbatons boy, who conjured\\nup one of his friends to join them so fast that Harry\\ncould have sworn he had zoomed him there by a\\nSummoning Charm.\\n“Vare is Herm-own-ninny?” said a voice.\\nKrum had just arrived at their table clutching two\\nbutterbeers.\\n“No idea,” said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. “Lost\\nher, have you?”\\nKrum was looking surly again.\\n“Veil, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks,” he said,\\nand he slouched off.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?”\\nPercy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together\\nand looking extremely pompous. “Excellent! That’s\\nthe whole point, you know — international magical\\ncooperation!”\\nTo Harry’s displeasure, Percy now took Padma’s\\nvacated seat. The top table was now empty; Professor\\nDumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo\\nBagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime\\nand Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the\\ndance floor as they waltzed through the students, and\\nKarkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next\\nsong ended, everybody applauded once more, and\\nHarry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall’s\\nhand and make his way back through the crowds, at\\nwhich point Fred and George accosted him.\\n“What do they think they’re doing, annoying senior\\nMinistry members?” Percy hissed, watching Fred and\\nGeorge suspiciously. “No respect ...”\\nLudo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly\\nquickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and\\ncame over to their table.\\n“I hope my brothers weren’t bothering you, Mr.\\nBagman?” said Percy at once.\\n“What? Oh not at all, not at all!” said Bagman. “No,\\nthey were just telling me a bit more about those fake\\nwands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on\\nthe marketing. I’ve promised to put them in touch\\nwith a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko’s Joke\\nShop. ...”\\nPercy didn’t look happy about this at all, and Harry\\nwas prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs.\\n \\nWeasley about this the moment he got home.\\nApparently Fred and George’s plans had grown even\\nmore ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to\\nthe public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry\\nsomething, but Percy diverted him.\\n“How do you feel the tournament’s going, Mr.\\nBagman? Our department’s quite satisfied — the\\nhitch with the Goblet of Fire” — he glanced at Harry\\n— “was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to\\nhave gone very smoothly since, don’t you think?”\\n“Oh yes,” Bagman said cheerfully, “it’s all been\\nenormous fun. How’s old Barty doing? Shame he\\ncouldn’t come.”\\n“Oh I’m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no\\ntime,” said Percy importantly, “but in the meantime,\\nI’m more than willing to take up the slack. Of course,\\nit’s not all attending balls” — he laughed airily — “oh\\nno, I’ve had to deal with all sorts of things that have\\ncropped up in his absence — you heard Ali Bashir\\nwas caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets\\ninto the country? And then we’ve been trying to\\npersuade the Transylvanians to sign the International\\nBan on Dueling. I’ve got a meeting with their Head of\\nMagical Cooperation in the new year — ”\\n“Let’s go for a walk,” Ron muttered to Harry, “get\\naway from Percy. ...”\\nPretending they wanted more drinks, Harry and Ron\\nleft the table, edged around the dance floor, and\\nslipped out into the entrance hall. The front doors\\nstood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose\\ngarden winked and twinkled as they went down the\\nfront steps, where they found themselves surrounded\\nby bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large\\nstone statues. Harry could hear splashing water,\\n \\nwhich sounded like a fountain. Here and there, people\\nwere sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set off\\nalong one of the winding paths through the\\nrosebushes, but they had gone only a short way when\\nthey heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.\\n\"... don’t see what there is to fuss about, Igor.”\\n“Severus, you cannot pretend this isn’t happening!”\\nKarkaroff’s voice sounded anxious and hushed, as\\nthough keen not to be overheard. “It’s been getting\\nclearer and clearer for months. I am becoming\\nseriously concerned, I can’t deny it — ”\\n“Then flee,” said Snape’s voice curtly. “Flee — I will\\nmake your excuses. I, however, am remaining at\\nHogwarts.”\\nSnape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape\\nhad his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart,\\nhis expression most ill-natured. Squeals issued from\\nmany of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from\\nthem.\\n“Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!” Snape snarled\\nas a girl ran past him. “And ten points from Hufflepuff\\ntoo, Stebbins!” as a boy went rushing after her. “And\\nwhat are you two doing?” he added, catching sight of\\nHarry and Ron on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry\\nsaw, looked slightly discomposed to see them\\nstanding there. His hand went nervously to his\\ngoatee, and he began winding it around his finger.\\n“We’re walking,” Ron told Snape shortly. “Not against\\nthe law, is it?”\\n“Keep walking, then!” Snape snarled, and he brushed\\npast them, his long black cloak billowing out behind\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nhim. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape. Harry and\\nRon continued down the path.\\n“What’s got Karkaroff all worried?” Ron muttered.\\n“And since when have he and Snape been on first-\\nname terms?” said Harry slowly.\\nThey had reached a large stone reindeer now, over\\nwhich they could see the sparkling jets of a tall\\nfountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous\\npeople were visible on a stone bench, watching the\\nwater in the moonlight. And then Harry heard Hagrid\\nspeak.\\n“Momen’ I saw yeh, I knew,” he was saying, in an\\noddly husky voice.\\nHarry and Ron froze. This didn’t sound like the sort of\\nscene they ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry\\nlooked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur\\nDelacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in\\na rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder\\nand jerked his head toward them, meaning that they\\ncould easily sneak off that way without being noticed\\n(Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but\\nRon, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur,\\nshook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper\\ninto the shadows behind the reindeer.\\n“What did you know, ’Agrid?” said Madame Maxime, a\\npurr in her low voice.\\nHarry definitely didn’t want to listen to this; he knew\\nHagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like\\nthis (he certainly would have) — if it had been\\npossible he would have put his fingers in his ears and\\nhummed loudly, but that wasn’t really an option.\\nInstead he tried to interest himself in a beetle\\n \\ncrawling along the stone reindeer’s back, but the\\nbeetle just wasn’t interesting enough to block out\\nHagrid’s next words.\\n“I jus’ knew ... knew you were like me. ... Was it yer\\nmother or yer father?”\\n“I — I don’t know what you mean, ’Agrid. ...”\\n“It was my mother,” said Hagrid quietly. “She was one\\no’ the las’ ones in Britain. ’Course, I can’ remember\\nher too well ... she left, see. When I was abou’ three.\\nShe wasn’ really the maternal sort. Well ... it’s not in\\ntheir natures, is it? Dunno what happened to her ...\\nmight be dead fer all I know. ...”\\nMadame Maxime didn’t say anything. And Harry, in\\nspite of himself, took his eyes off the beetle and\\nlooked over the top of the reindeer’s antlers, listening.\\n. . . He had never heard Hagrid talk about his\\nchildhood before.\\n“Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen’. Tiny\\nlittle bloke, my dad was. By the time I was six I could\\nlift him up an’ put him on top o’ the dresser if he\\nannoyed me. Used ter make him laugh. ...” Hagrid’s\\ndeep voice broke. Madame Maxime was listening,\\nmotionless, apparently staring at the silvery fountain.\\n“Dad raised me ... but he died, o’ course, jus’ after I\\nstarted school. Sorta had ter make me own way after\\nthat. Dumbledore was a real help, mind. Very kind ter\\nme, he was. ...”\\nHagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief\\nand blew his nose heavily.\\n“So ... anyway ... enough abou’ me. What about you?\\nWhich side you got it on?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBut Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.\\n“It is chilly,” she said — but whatever the weather\\nwas doing, it was nowhere near as cold as her voice.\\n“I think I will go in now.”\\n“Eh?” said Hagrid blankly. “No, don’ go! I’ve — I’ve\\nnever met another one before!”\\n“Anuzzer what, precisely?” said Madame Maxime, her\\ntone icy.\\nHarry could have told Hagrid it was best not to\\nanswer; he stood there in the shadows gritting his\\nteeth, hoping against hope he wouldn’t — but it was\\nno good.\\n“Another half-giant, o’ course!” said Hagrid.\\n“ ’Ow dare you!” shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice\\nexploded through the peaceful night air like a\\nfoghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall\\nout of their rosebush. “I ’ave nevair been more\\ninsulted in my life! ’Alf-giant? Moi? I ’ave — I ’ave big\\nbones!”\\nShe stormed away; great multicolored swarms of\\nfairies rose into the air as she passed, angrily pushing\\naside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the bench,\\nstaring after her. It was much too dark to make out\\nhis expression. Then, after about a minute, he stood\\nup and strode away, not back to the castle, but off\\nout into the dark grounds in the direction of his\\ncabin.\\n“C’mon,” Harry said, very quietly to Ron. “Let’s go. ...”\\nBut Ron didn’t move.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“What’s up?” said Harry, looking at him.\\nRon looked around at Harry, his expression very\\nserious indeed.\\n“Did you know?” he whispered. “About Hagrid being\\nhalf-giant?”\\n“No,” Harry said, shrugging. “So what?”\\nHe knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving\\nhim, that he was once again revealing his ignorance\\nof the wizarding world. Brought up by the Dursleys,\\nthere were many things that wizards took for granted\\nthat were revelations to Harry, but these surprises\\nhad become fewer with each successive year. Now,\\nhowever, he could tell that most wizards would not\\nhave said “So what?” upon finding out that one of\\ntheir friends had a giantess for a mother.\\n“I’ll explain inside,” said Ron quietly, “c’mon. ...”\\nFleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably\\ninto a more private clump of bushes. Harry and Ron\\nreturned to the Great Hall. Parvati and Padma were\\nnow sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of\\nBeauxbatons boys, and Hermione was once more\\ndancing with Krum. Harry and Ron sat down at a\\ntable far removed from the dance floor.\\n“So?” Harry prompted Ron. “What’s the problem with\\ngiants?”\\n“Well, they’re ... they’re ...” Ron struggled for words.\\n\"... not very nice,” he finished lamely.\\n“Who cares?” Harry said. “There’s nothing wrong with\\nHagrid!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I know there isn’t, but ... blimey, no wonder he keeps\\nit quiet,” Ron said, shaking his head. “I always\\nthought he’d got in the way of a bad Engorgement\\nCharm when he was a kid or something. Didn’t like to\\nmention it. ...”\\n“But what’s it matter if his mother was a giantess?”\\nsaid Harry.\\n“Well ... no one who knows him will care, ’cos they’ll\\nknow he’s not dangerous,” said Ron slowly. “But ...\\nHarry, they’re just vicious, giants. It’s like Hagrid\\nsaid, it’s in their natures, they’re like trolls ... they\\njust like killing, everyone knows that. There aren’t\\nany left in Britain now, though.”\\n“What happened to them?”\\n“Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got\\nthemselves killed by Aurors. There ’re supposed to be\\ngiants abroad, though. ... They hide out in mountains\\nmostly. ...”\\n“I don’t know who Maxime thinks she’s kidding,”\\nHarry said, watching Madame Maxime sitting alone at\\nthe judges’ table, looking very somber. “If Hagrid ’s\\nhalf-giant, she definitely is. Big bones ... the only\\nthing that’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.”\\nHarry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing\\ngiants in their corner, neither of them having any\\ninclination to dance. Harry tried not to watch Cho\\nand Cedric too much; it gave him a strong desire to\\nkick something.\\nWhen the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight,\\neveryone gave them a last, loud round of applause\\nand started to wend their way into the entrance hall.\\nMany people were expressing the wish that the ball\\n \\ncould have gone on longer, but Harry was perfectly\\nhappy to be going to bed; as far as he was concerned,\\nthe evening hadn’t been much fun.\\nOut in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw\\nHermione saying good night to Krum before he went\\nback to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a very\\ncold look and swept past him up the marble staircase\\nwithout speaking. Harry and Ron followed her, but\\nhalfway up the staircase Harry heard someone calling\\nhim.\\n“Hey — Harry!”\\nIt was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for\\nhim in the entrance hall below.\\n“Yeah?” said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs\\ntoward him.\\nCedric looked as though he didn’t want to say\\nwhatever it was in front of Ron, who shrugged,\\nlooking bad-tempered, and continued to climb the\\nstairs.\\n“Listen ...” Cedric lowered his voice as Ron\\ndisappeared. “I owe you one for telling me about the\\ndragons. You know that golden egg? Does yours wail\\nwhen you open it?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry.\\n“Well ... take a bath, okay?”\\n“What?”\\n“Take a bath, and — er — take the egg with you, and\\n— er — just mull things over in the hot water. It’ll\\nhelp you think. ... Trust me.”\\n \\nHarry stared at him.\\n“Tell you what,” Cedric said, “use the prefects’\\nbathroom. Fourth door to the left of that statue of\\nBoris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password’s\\n‘pine fresh. ’ Gotta go . . . want to say good night — ”\\nHe grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the\\nstairs to Cho.\\nHarry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That\\nhad been extremely strange advice. Why would a bath\\nhelp him to work out what the wailing egg meant?\\nWas Cedric pulling his leg? Was he trying to make\\nHarry look like a fool, so Cho would like him even\\nmore by comparison?\\nThe Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the\\npicture over the portrait hole. Harry had to yell “Fairy\\nlights!” before he woke them up, and when he did,\\nthey were extremely irritated. He climbed into the\\ncommon room and found Ron and Hermione having a\\nblazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they were\\nbellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.\\n“Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution\\nis, don’t you?” yelled Hermione; her hair was coming\\ndown out of its elegant bun now, and her face was\\nscrewed up in anger.\\n“Oh yeah?” Ron yelled back. “What’s that?”\\n“Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else\\ndoes, and not as a last resort!”\\nRon mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water\\nas Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the\\ngirls’ staircase to bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Well,” he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, “well —\\nthat just proves — completely missed the point — ”\\nHarry didn’t say anything. He liked being back on\\nspeaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind\\nright now — but he somehow thought that Hermione\\nhad gotten the point much better than Ron had.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nRITA SKEBTER’S SCOOP\\nEverybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor\\ncommon room was much quieter than it had been\\nlately, many yawns punctuating the lazy\\nconversations. Hermione’s hair was bushy again; she\\nconfessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts\\nof Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for the ball, “but it’s\\nway too much bother to do every day,” she said\\nmatter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks\\nbehind the ears.\\nRon and Hermione seemed to have reached an\\nunspoken agreement not to discuss their argument.\\nThey were being quite friendly to each other, though\\noddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling\\nHermione about the conversation they had overheard\\nbetween Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione\\ndidn’t seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half-\\ngiant nearly as shocking as Ron did.\\n“Well, I thought he must be,” she said, shrugging. “I\\nknew he couldn’t be pure giant because they’re about\\ntwenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about\\n \\ngiants. They can’t all be horrible. ... It’s the same sort\\nof prejudice that people have toward werewolves. ...\\nIt’s just bigotry, isn’t it?”\\nRon looked as though he would have liked to reply\\nscathingly, but perhaps he didn’t want another row,\\nbecause he contented himself with shaking his head\\ndisbelievingly while Hermione wasn’t looking.\\nIt was time now to think of the homework they had\\nneglected during the first week of the holidays.\\nEverybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that\\nChristmas was over — everybody except Harry, that\\nis, who was starting (once again) to feel slightly\\nnervous.\\nThe trouble was that February the twenty-fourth\\nlooked a lot closer from this side of Christmas, and he\\nstill hadn’t done anything about working out the clue\\ninside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the\\negg out of his trunk every time he went up to the\\ndormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping\\nthat this time it would make some sense. He strained\\nto think what the sound reminded him of, apart from\\nthirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything\\nelse like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and\\nopened it again to see if the sound had changed, but\\nit hadn’t. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting\\nover all the wailing, but nothing happened. He even\\nthrew the egg across the room — though he hadn’t\\nreally expected that to help.\\nHarry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had\\ngiven him, but his less-than-friendly feelings toward\\nCedric just now meant that he was keen not to take\\nhis help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seemed to\\nhim that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a\\nhand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He,\\nHarry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in\\n \\nthe first task — and Cedric’s idea of a fair exchange\\nhad been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn’t\\nneed that sort of rubbishy help — not from someone\\nwho kept walking down corridors hand in hand with\\nCho, anyway. And so the first day of the new term\\narrived, and Harry set off to lessons, weighed down\\nwith books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also\\nwith the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his\\nstomach, as though he were carrying that around\\nwith him too.\\nSnow was still thick upon the grounds, and the\\ngreenhouse windows were covered in condensation so\\nthick that they couldn’t see out of them in Herbology.\\nNobody was looking forward to Care of Magical\\nCreatures much in this weather, though as Ron said,\\nthe skrewts would probably warm them up nicely,\\neither by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully\\nthat Hagrid’s cabin would catch fire.\\nWhen they arrived at Hagrid’s cabin, however, they\\nfound an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair\\nand a very prominent chin standing before his front\\ndoor.\\n“Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,” she\\nbarked at them as they struggled toward her through\\nthe snow.\\n“Who ’re you?” said Ron, staring at her. “Where’s\\nHagrid?”\\n“My name is Professor Grubbly-Plank,” she said\\nbriskly. “I am your temporary Care of Magical\\nCreatures teacher.”\\n“Where’s Hagrid?” Harry repeated loudly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“He is indisposed,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank\\nshortly.\\nSoft and unpleasant laughter reached Harry’s ears.\\nHe turned; Draco Malfoy and the rest of the\\nSlytherins were joining the class. All of them looked\\ngleeful, and none of them looked surprised to see\\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank.\\n“This way, please,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and\\nshe strode off around the paddock where the\\nBeauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione followed her, looking back over their\\nshoulders at Hagrid’s cabin. All the curtains were\\nclosed. Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill?\\n“What’s wrong with Hagrid?” Harry said, hurrying to\\ncatch up with Professor Grubbly-Plank.\\n“Never you mind,” she said as though she thought he\\nwas being nosy.\\n“I do mind, though,” said Harry hotly. “What’s up with\\nhim?”\\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank acted as though she couldn’t\\nhear him. She led them past the paddock where the\\nhuge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled\\nagainst the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the\\nforest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was\\ntethered.\\nMany of the girls “ooooohed!” at the sight of the\\nunicorn.\\n“Oh it’s so beautiful!” whispered Lavender Brown.\\n“How did she get it? They’re supposed to be really\\nhard to catch!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThe unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow\\nall around look gray. It was pawing the ground\\nnervously with its golden hooves and throwing back\\nits horned head.\\n“Boys keep back!” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank,\\nthrowing out an arm and catching Harry hard in the\\nchest. “They prefer the woman’s touch, unicorns.\\nGirls to the front, and approach with care, come on,\\neasy does it. ...”\\nShe and the girls walked slowly forward toward the\\nunicorn, leaving the boys standing near the paddock\\nfence, watching. The moment Professor Grubbly-\\nPlank was out of earshot, Harry turned to Ron.\\n“What d’you reckon’s wrong with him? You don’t\\nthink a skrewt — ?”\\n“Oh he hasn’t been attacked, Potter, if that’s what\\nyou’re thinking,” said Malfoy softly. “No, he’s just too\\nashamed to show his big, ugly face.”\\n“What d’you mean?” said Harry sharply.\\nMalfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes\\nand pulled out a folded page of newsprint.\\n“There you go,” he said. “Hate to break it to you,\\nPotter. ...”\\nHe smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it,\\nand read it, with Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville\\nlooking over his shoulder. It was an article topped\\nwith a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.\\nDUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nAlbus Dumbledore, eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts\\nSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been\\nafraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes\\nRita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. In September of\\nthis year, he hired Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody, the\\nnotoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many\\nraised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic, given\\nMoody’s well-known habit of attacking anybody who\\nmakes a sudden movement in his presence. Mad-Eye\\nMoody, however, looks responsible and kindly when\\nset beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to\\nteach Care of Magical Creatures.\\nRubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from\\nHogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of\\ngamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for\\nhim by Dumbledore. Last year, however, Hagrid used\\nhis mysterious influence over the headmaster to\\nsecure the additional post of Care of Magical\\nCreatures teacher, over the heads of many better-\\nqualified candidates.\\nAn alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man,\\nHagrid has been using his newfound authority to\\nterrify the students in his care with a succession of\\nhorrific creatures. While Dumbledore turns a blind\\neye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series\\nof lessons that many admit to being “very\\nfrightening.”\\n“I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent\\nCrabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,” says Draco\\nMalfoy, a fourth-year student. “We all hate Hagrid,\\nbut we’re just too scared to say anything.”\\nHagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of\\nintimidation, however. In conversation with a Daily\\nProphet reporter last month, he admitted breeding\\n \\ncreatures he has dubbed “Blast-Ended Skrewts, ”\\nhighly dangerous crosses between manticores and fire-\\ncrabs. The creation of new breeds of magical creature\\nis, of course, an activity usually closely observed by\\nthe Department for the Regulation and Control of\\nMagical Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself\\nto be above such petty restrictions.\\n“I was just having some fun,” he says, before hastily\\nchanging the subject.\\nAs if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now\\nunearthed evidence that Hagrid is not — as he has\\nalways pretended — a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in\\nfact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively\\nreveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa,\\nwhose whereabouts are currently unknown.\\nBloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought\\nthemselves to the point of extinction by warring\\namongst themselves during the last century. The\\nhandful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-\\nMust-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some\\nof the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of\\nterror.\\nWhile many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-\\nNot-Be-Named were killed by Aurors working against\\nthe Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is\\npossible she escaped to one of the giant communities\\nstill existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics\\nduring Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any\\nguide, however, Fridwulfa’s son appears to have\\ninherited her brutal nature.\\nIn a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed\\na close friendship with the boy who brought around\\nYou-Know- Who’s fall from power — thereby driving\\nHagrid ’s own mother, like the rest of You-Know- Who’s\\n \\nsupporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is\\nunaware of the unpleasant truth about his large\\nfriend — but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to\\nensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow\\nstudents, is warned about the dangers of associating\\nwith part-giants.\\nHarry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose\\nmouth was hanging open.\\n“How did she find out?” he whispered.\\nBut that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.\\n“What d’you mean, “we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat\\nat Malfoy. “What’s this rubbish about him” — he\\npointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a\\nflobberworm? They haven’t even got teeth!”\\nCrabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with\\nhimself.\\n“Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf’s\\nteaching career,” said Malfoy, his eyes glinting. “Half-\\ngiant ... and there was me thinking he’d just\\nswallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young.\\n... None of the mummies and daddies are going to like\\nthis at all. ... They’ll be worried he’ll eat their kids, ha,\\nha. ...”\\n“You — ”\\n“Are you paying attention over there?”\\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank’s voice carried over to the\\nboys; the girls were all clustered around the unicorn\\nnow, stroking it. Harry was so angry that the Daily\\nPage |486 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nProphet article shook in his hands as he turned to\\nstare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical\\nproperties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now\\nenumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could\\nhear too.\\n“I hope she stays, that woman!” said Parvati Patil\\nwhen the lesson had ended and they were all heading\\nback to the castle for lunch. “That’s more what I\\nthought Care of Magical Creatures would be like . . .\\nproper creatures like unicorns, not monsters. ...”\\n“What about Hagrid?” Harry said angrily as they went\\nup the steps.\\n“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice. “He\\ncan still be gamekeeper, can’t he?”\\nParvati had been very cool toward Harry since the\\nball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit\\nmore attention, but she seemed to have had a good\\ntime all the same. She was certainly telling anybody\\nwho would listen that she had made arrangements to\\nmeet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the\\nnext weekend trip.\\n“That was a really good lesson,” said Hermione as\\nthey entered the Great Hall. “I didn’t know half the\\nthings Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni — ”\\n“Look at this!” Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily\\nProphet article under Hermione ’s nose.\\nHermione ’s mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction\\nwas exactly the same as Ron’s.\\n“How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You\\ndon’t think Hagrid told her?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“No,” said Harry, leading the way over to the\\nGryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair,\\nfurious. “He never even told us, did he? I reckon she\\nwas so mad he wouldn’t give her loads of horrible\\nstuff about me, she went ferreting around to get him\\nback.”\\n“Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the\\nball,” said Hermione quietly.\\n“We’d have seen her in the garden!” said Ron.\\n“Anyway, she’s not supposed to come into school\\nanymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her. ...”\\n“Maybe she’s got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry,\\nladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing\\nit everywhere in his anger. “Sort of thing she’d do,\\nisn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.”\\n“Like you and Ron did, you mean,” said Hermione.\\n“We weren’t trying to hear him!” said Ron indignantly.\\n“We didn’t have any choice! The stupid prat, talking\\nabout his giantess mother where anyone could have\\nheard him!”\\n“We’ve got to go and see him,” said Harry. “This\\nevening, after Divination. Tell him we want him back\\n... you do want him back?” he shot at Hermione.\\n“I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a\\nnice change, having a proper Care of Magical\\nCreatures lesson for once — but I do want Hagrid\\nback, of course I do!” Hermione added hastily,\\nquailing under Harry’s furious stare.\\nSo that evening after dinner, the three of them left the\\ncastle once more and went down through the frozen\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ngrounds to Hagrid’s cabin. They knocked, and Fang’s\\nbooming barks answered.\\n“Hagrid, it’s us!” Harry shouted, pounding on the\\ndoor. “Open up!\\nHagrid didn’t answer. They could hear Fang\\nscratching at the door, whining, but it didn’t open.\\nThey hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even\\nwent and banged on one of the windows, but there\\nwas no response.\\n“What’s he avoiding us for?” Hermione said when they\\nhad finally given up and were walking back to the\\nschool. “He surely doesn’t think we’d care about him\\nbeing half-giant?”\\nBut it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn’t see a\\nsign of him all week. He didn’t appear at the staff\\ntable at mealtimes, they didn’t see him going about\\nhis gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor\\nGrubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical\\nCreatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every\\npossible opportunity.\\n“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to\\nHarry whenever there was a teacher around, so that\\nhe was safe from Harry’s retaliation. “Missing the\\nelephant-man?”\\nThere was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through\\nJanuary. Hermione was very surprised that Harry\\nwas going to go.\\n“I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the\\ncommon room being quiet,” she said. “Really get to\\nwork on that egg.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s\\nabout now,” Harry lied.\\n“Have you really?” said Hermione, looking impressed.\\n“Well done!”\\nHarry’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored\\nthem. He still had five weeks to work out that egg\\nclue, after all, and that was ages ... whereas if he\\nwent into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and\\nget a chance to persuade him to come back.\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on\\nSaturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds\\ntoward the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang\\nship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum\\nemerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but\\nswimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but\\napparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he\\nclimbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his\\narms, and dived, right into the lake.\\n“He’s mad!” said Harry, staring at Krum’s dark head\\nas it bobbed out into the middle of the lake. “It must\\nbe freezing, it’s January!”\\n“It’s a lot colder where he comes from,” said\\nHermione. “I suppose it feels quite warm to him.”\\n“Yeah, but there’s still the giant squid,” said Ron. He\\ndidn’t sound anxious — if anything, he sounded\\nhopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and\\nfrowned.\\n“He’s really nice, you know,” she said. “He’s not at all\\nlike you’d think, coming from Durmstrang. He likes it\\nmuch better here, he told me.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nRon said nothing. He hadn’t mentioned Viktor Krum\\nsince the ball, but Harry had found a miniature arm\\nunder his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very\\nmuch as though it had been snapped off a small\\nmodel figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.\\nHarry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all\\nthe way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a\\nvisit to the Three Broomsticks once he had\\nascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.\\nThe pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look\\naround at all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn’t\\nthere. Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with Ron\\nand Hermione, ordered three butter-beers from\\nMadam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he\\nmight just as well have stayed behind and listened to\\nthe egg wailing after all.\\n“Doesn’t he ever go into the office?” Hermione\\nwhispered suddenly. “Look!”\\nShe pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry\\nsaw Ludo Bagman reflected there, sitting in a\\nshadowy corner with a bunch of goblins. Bagman was\\ntalking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of\\nwhom had their arms crossed and were looking rather\\nmenacing.\\nIt was indeed odd, Harry thought, that Bagman was\\nhere at the Three Broomsticks on a weekend when\\nthere was no Triwizard event, and therefore no\\njudging to be done. He watched Bagman in the\\nmirror. He was looking strained again, quite as\\nstrained as he had that night in the forest before the\\nDark Mark had appeared. But just then Bagman\\nglanced over at the bar, saw Harry, and stood up.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“In a moment, in a moment!” Harry heard him say\\nbrusquely to the goblins, and Bagman hurried\\nthrough the pub toward Harry, his boyish grin back\\nin place.\\n“Harry!” he said. “How are you? Been hoping to run\\ninto you! Everything going all right?”\\n“Fine, thanks,” said Harry.\\n“Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?”\\nsaid Bagman eagerly. “You couldn’t give us a\\nmoment, you two, could you?”\\n“Er — okay,” said Ron, and he and Hermione went off\\nto find a table.\\nBagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest\\nfrom Madam Rosmerta.\\n“Well, I just thought I’d congratulate you again on\\nyour splendid performance against that Horntail,\\nHarry,” said Bagman. “Really superb.”\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, but he knew this couldn’t be all\\nthat Bagman wanted to say, because he could have\\ncongratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione.\\nBagman didn’t seem in any particular rush to spill\\nthe beans, though. Harry saw him glance into the\\nmirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all\\nwatching him and Harry in silence through their\\ndark, slanting eyes.\\n“Absolute nightmare,” said Bagman to Harry in an\\nundertone, noticing Harry watching the goblins too.\\n“Their English isn’t too good ... it’s like being back\\nwith all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup ...\\nbut at least they used sign language another human\\ncould recognize. This lot keep gabbling in\\n \\nGobbledegook . . . and I only know one word of\\nGobbledegook. Bladvak. It means ‘pickax.’ I don’t like\\nto use it in case they think I’m threatening them.”\\nHe gave a short, booming laugh.\\n“What do they want?” Harry said, noticing how the\\ngoblins were still watching Bagman very closely.\\n“Er — well ...” said Bagman, looking suddenly\\nnervous. “They ... er ... they’re looking for Barry\\nCrouch.”\\n“Why are they looking for him here?” said Harry. “He’s\\nat the Ministry in London, isn’t he?”\\n“Er ... as a matter of fact, I’ve no idea where he is,”\\nsaid Bagman. “He’s sort of ... stopped coming to work.\\nBeen absent for a couple of weeks now. Young Percy,\\nhis assistant, says he’s ill. Apparently he’s just been\\nsending instructions in by owl. But would you mind\\nnot mentioning that to anyone, Harry? Because Rita\\nSkeeter’s still poking around everywhere she can, and\\nI’m willing to bet she’d work up Barty’s illness into\\nsomething sinister. Probably say he’s gone missing\\nlike Bertha Jorkins.”\\n“Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?”\\nHarry asked.\\n“No,” said Bagman, looking strained again. “I’ve got\\npeople looking, of course ...” (About time, thought\\nHarry) “and it’s all very strange. She definitely arrived\\nin Albania, because she met her second cousin there.\\nAnd then she left the cousin’s house to go south and\\nsee an aunt . . . and she seems to have vanished\\nwithout trace en route. Blowed if I can see where\\nshe’s got to ... she doesn’t seem the type to elope, for\\ninstance ... but still. ... What are we doing, talking\\n \\nabout goblins and Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to\\nask you” — he lowered his voice — “how are you\\ngetting on with your golden egg?”\\n“Er ... not bad,” Harry said untruthfully.\\nBagman seemed to know he wasn’t being honest.\\n“Listen, Harry,” he said (still in a very low voice), “I\\nfeel very bad about all this . . . you were thrown into\\nthis tournament, you didn’t volunteer for it... and if\\n...” (his voice was so quiet now, Harry had to lean\\ncloser to listen) “if I can help at all ... a prod in the\\nright direction ... I’ve taken a liking to you ... the way\\nyou got past that dragon! ... well, just say the word.”\\nHarry stared up into Bagman’s round, rosy face and\\nhis wide, baby-blue eyes.\\n“We’re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren’t\\nwe?” he said, careful to keep his voice casual and not\\nsound as though he was accusing the head of the\\nDepartment of Magical Games and Sports of breaking\\nthe rules.\\n“Well ... well, yes,” said Bagman impatiently, “but —\\ncome on, Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory,\\ndon’t we?”\\n“Have you offered Cedric help?” Harry said.\\nThe smallest of frowns creased Bagman’s smooth\\nface. “No, I haven’t,” he said. “I — well, like I say, I’ve\\ntaken a liking to you. Just thought I’d offer ...”\\n“Well, thanks,” said Harry, “but I think I’m nearly\\nthere with the egg . . . couple more days should crack\\nit.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHe wasn’t entirely sure why he was refusing\\nBagman’s help, except that Bagman was almost a\\nstranger to him, and accepting his assistance would\\nfeel somehow much more like cheating than asking\\nadvice from Ron, Hermione, or Sirius.\\nBagman looked almost affronted, but couldn’t say\\nmuch more as Fred and George turned up at that\\npoint.\\n“Hello, Mr. Bagman,” said Fred brightly. “Can we buy\\nyou a drink?”\\n“Er ... no,” said Bagman, with a last disappointed\\nglance at Harry, “no, thank you, boys ...”\\nFred and George looked quite as disappointed as\\nBagman, who was surveying Harry as though he had\\nlet him down badly.\\n“Well, I must dash,” he said. “Nice seeing you all.\\nGood luck, Harry.”\\nHe hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their\\nchairs and exited after him. Harry went to rejoin Ron\\nand Hermione.\\n“What did he want?” Ron said, the moment Harry had\\nsat down.\\n“He offered to help me with the golden egg,” said\\nHarry.\\n“He shouldn’t be doing that!” said Hermione, looking\\nvery shocked. “He’s one of the judges! And anyway,\\nyou’ve already worked it out — haven’t you?”\\n“Er ... nearly,” said Harry.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Well, I don’t think Dumbledore would like it if he\\nknew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!”\\nsaid Hermione, still looking deeply disapproving. “I\\nhope he’s trying to help Cedric as much!”\\n“He’s not, I asked,” said Harry.\\n“Who cares if Diggory’s getting help?” said Ron. Harry\\nprivately agreed.\\n“Those goblins didn’t look very friendly,” said\\nHermione, sipping her butterbeer. “What were they\\ndoing here?”\\n“Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman,” said\\nHarry. “He’s still ill. Hasn’t been into work.”\\n“Maybe Percy’s poisoning him,” said Ron. “Probably\\nthinks if Crouch snuffs it he’ll be made head of the\\nDepartment of International Magical Cooperation.”\\nHermione gave Ron a don’t -joke-about-things-like-\\nthat look, and said, “Funny, goblins looking for Mr.\\nCrouch. . . . They’d normally deal with the Department\\nfor the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.”\\n“Crouch can speak loads of different languages,\\nthough,” said Harry. “Maybe they need an\\ninterpreter.”\\n“Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you?”\\nRon asked Hermione. “Thinking of starting up\\nS.P.U.G. or something? Society for the Protection of\\nUgly Goblins?”\\n“Ha, ha, ha,” said Hermione sarcastically. “Goblins\\ndon’t need protection. Haven’t you been listening to\\nwhat Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin\\nrebellions?”\\n \\n“No,” said Harry and Ron together.\\n“Well, they’re quite capable of dealing with wizards,”\\nsaid Hermione, taking another sip of butterbeer.\\n“They’re very clever. They’re not like house-elves, who\\nnever stick up for themselves.”\\n“Uh-oh,” said Ron, staring at the door.\\nRita Skeeter had just entered. She was wearing\\nbanana-yellow robes today; her long nails were\\npainted shocking pink, and she was accompanied by\\nher paunchy photographer. She bought drinks, and\\nshe and the photographer made their way through\\nthe crowds to a table nearby, Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione glaring at her as she approached. She was\\ntalking fast and looking very satisfied about\\nsomething.\\n\"... didn’t seem very keen to talk to us, did he, Bozo?\\nNow, why would that be, do you think? And what’s he\\ndoing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway? Showing\\nthem the sights . . . what nonsense ... he was always a\\nbad liar. Reckon something’s up? Think we should do\\na bit of digging? ‘Disgraced Ex-Head of Magical\\nGames and Sports, Ludo Bagman ...’ Snappy start to\\na sentence, Bozo — we just need to find a story to fit\\nit — ”\\n“Trying to ruin someone else’s life?” said Harry loudly.\\nA few people looked around. Rita Skeeter ’s eyes\\nwidened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw\\nwho had spoken.\\n“Harry!” she said, beaming. “How lovely! Why don’t\\nyou come and join — ?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I wouldn’t come near you with a ten-foot\\nbroomstick,” said Harry furiously. “What did you do\\nthat to Hagrid for, eh?”\\nRita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows.\\n“Our readers have a right to the truth, Harry. I am\\nmerely doing my — ”\\n“Who cares if he’s half- giant?” Harry shouted. “There’s\\nnothing wrong with him!”\\nThe whole pub had gone very quiet. Madam Rosmerta\\nwas staring over from behind the bar, apparently\\noblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling\\nwith mead was overflowing.\\nRita Skeeter’s smile flickered very slightly, but she\\nhitched it back almost at once; she snapped open her\\ncrocodile-skin handbag, pulled out her Quick-Quotes\\nQuill, and said, “How about giving me an interview\\nabout the Hagrid you know, Harry? The man behind\\nthe muscles? Your unlikely friendship and the\\nreasons behind it. Would you call him a father\\nsubstitute?”\\nHermione stood up very abruptly, her butterbeer\\nclutched in her hand as though it were a grenade.\\n“You horrible woman,” she said, through gritted teeth,\\n“you don’t care, do you, anything for a story, and\\nanyone will do, won’t they? Even Ludo Bagman — ”\\n“Sit down, you silly little girl, and don’t talk about\\nthings you don’t understand,” said Rita Skeeter\\ncoldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on Hermione. “I\\nknow things about Ludo Bagman that would make\\nyour hair curl . . . not that it needs it — ” she added,\\neyeing Hermione ’s bushy hair.\\n \\n“Let’s go,” said Hermione, “c’mon, Harry — Ron ...”\\nThey left; many people were staring at them as they\\nwent. Harry glanced back as they reached the door.\\nRita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill was out; it was\\nzooming backward and forward over a piece of\\nparchment on the table.\\n“She’ll be after you next, Hermione,” said Ron in a low\\nand worried voice as they walked quickly back up the\\nstreet.\\n“Let her try!” said Hermione defiantly; she was\\nshaking with rage. “I’ll show her! Silly little girl, am I?\\nOh, I’ll get her back for this. First Harry, then Hagrid\\n“You don’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,” said\\nRon nervously. “I’m serious, Hermione, she’ll dig up\\nsomething on you — ”\\n“My parents don’t read the Daily Prophet She can’t\\nscare me into hiding!” said Hermione, now striding\\nalong so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could do to\\nkeep up with her. The last time Harry had seen\\nHermione in a rage like this, she had hit Draco Malfoy\\naround the face. “And Hagrid isn’t hiding anymore!\\nHe should never have let that excuse for a human\\nbeing upset him! Come on!”\\nBreaking into a run, she led them all the way back up\\nthe road, through the gates flanked by winged boars,\\nand up through the grounds to Hagrid ’s cabin.\\nThe curtains were still drawn, and they could hear\\nFang barking as they approached.\\n“Hagrid!” Hermione shouted, pounding on his front\\ndoor. “Hagrid, that’s enough! We know you’re in there!\\n \\nNobody cares if your mum was a giantess, Hagrid!\\nYou can’t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you!\\nHagrid, get out here, you’re just being — ”\\nThe door opened. Hermione said, “About t — !” and\\nthen stopped, very suddenly, because she had found\\nherself face-to-face, not with Hagrid, but with Albus\\nDumbledore.\\n“Good afternoon,” he said pleasantly, smiling down at\\nthem.\\n“We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid,” said Hermione\\nin a rather small voice.\\n“Yes, I surmised as much,” said Dumbledore, his eyes\\ntwinkling. “Why don’t you come in?”\\n“Oh ... um ... okay,” said Hermione.\\nShe, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang\\nlaunched himself upon Harry the moment he entered,\\nbarking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry\\nfended off Fang and looked around.\\nHagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two\\nlarge mugs of tea. He looked a real mess. His face was\\nblotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the\\nother extreme where his hair was concerned; far from\\ntrying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of\\ntangled wire.\\n“Hi, Hagrid,” said Harry.\\nHagrid looked up.\\n“ ’Lo,” he said in a very hoarse voice.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“More tea, I think,” said Dumbledore, closing the door\\nbehind Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his\\nwand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared\\nin midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore\\nmagicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat\\ndown. There was a slight pause, and then\\nDumbledore said, “Did you by any chance hear what\\nMiss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?”\\nHermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled\\nat her and continued, “Hermione, Harry, and Ron still\\nseem to want to know you, judging by the way they\\nwere attempting to break down the door.”\\n“Of course we still want to know you!” Harry said,\\nstaring at Hagrid. “You don’t think anything that\\nSkeeter cow — sorry, Professor,” he added quickly,\\nlooking at Dumbledore.\\n“I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea\\nwhat you said, Harry,” said Dumbledore, twiddling\\nhis thumbs and staring at the ceiling.\\n“Er — right,” said Harry sheepishly. “I just meant —\\nHagrid, how could you think we’d care what that —\\nwoman — wrote about you?”\\nTwo fat tears leaked out of Hagrid ’s beetle-black eyes\\nand fell slowly into his tangled beard.\\n“Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, Hagrid,”\\nsaid Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the\\nceiling. “I have shown you the letters from the\\ncountless parents who remember you from their own\\ndays here, telling me in no uncertain terms that if I\\nsacked you, they would have something to say about\\nit — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Not all of ’em,” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Not all of ’em\\nwan’ me ter stay.”\\n“Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal\\npopularity, I’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a\\nvery long time,” said Dumbledore, now peering sternly\\nover his half-moon spectacles. “Not a week has\\npassed since I became headmaster of this school\\nwhen I haven’t had at least one owl complaining\\nabout the way I run it. But what should I do?\\nBarricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to\\nanybody?”\\n“Yeh — yeh’re not half-giant!” said Hagrid croakily.\\n“Hagrid, look what I’ve got for relatives!” Harry said\\nfuriously. “Look at the Dursleys!”\\n“An excellent point,” said Professor Dumbledore. “My\\nown brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing\\ninappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the\\npapers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He\\nheld his head high and went about his business as\\nusual! Of course, I’m not entirely sure he can read, so\\nthat may not have been bravery. ...”\\n“Come back and teach, Hagrid,” said Hermione\\nquietly, “please come back, we really miss you.”\\nHagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks\\nand into his tangled beard.\\nDumbledore stood up. “I refuse to accept your\\nresignation, Hagrid, and I expect you back at work on\\nMonday,” he said. “You will join me for breakfast at\\neight-thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good\\nafternoon to you all.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nDumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch\\nFang’s ears. When the door had shut behind him,\\nHagrid began to sob into his dustbin-lid-sized hands.\\nHermione kept patting his arm, and at last, Hagrid\\nlooked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, “Great\\nman, Dumbledore ... great man ...”\\n“Yeah, he is,” said Ron. “Can I have one of these\\ncakes, Hagrid?”\\n“Help yerself,” said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the\\nback of his hand. “Ar, he’s righ’, o’ course — yeh’re all\\nrigh’ ... I bin stupid ... my ol’ dad woulda bin\\nashamed o’ the way I’ve bin behavin’. ...” More tears\\nleaked out, but he wiped them away more forcefully,\\nand said, “Never shown you a picture of my old dad,\\nhave I? Here ...”\\nHagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a\\ndrawer, and pulled out a picture of a short wizard\\nwith Hagrid’s crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat\\non top of Hagrid’s shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven\\nor eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him,\\nbut his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth\\n— he looked hardly older than eleven.\\n“Tha’ was taken jus’ after I got inter Hogwarts,”\\nHagrid croaked. “Dad was dead chuffed ... thought I\\nmigh’ not be a wizard, see, ’cos me mum ... well,\\nanyway. ’Course, I never was great shakes at magic,\\nreally ... but at least he never saw me expelled. Died,\\nsee, in me second year. ...\\n“Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after\\nDad went. Got me the gamekeeper job ... trusts\\npeople, he does. Gives ’em second chances ... tha’s\\nwhat sets him apar’ from other heads, see. He’ll\\naccept anyone at Hogwarts, s’long as they’ve got the\\ntalent. Knows people can turn out okay even if their\\n \\nfamilies weren’ ... well ... all tha’ respectable. But\\nsome don’ understand that. There’s some who’d\\nalways hold it against yeh ... there’s some who’d even\\npretend they just had big bones rather than stand up\\nan’ say — I am what I am, an’ I’m not ashamed.\\n‘Never be ashamed,’ my ol’ dad used ter say, ‘there’s\\nsome wholl hold it against you, but they’re not worth\\nbotherin’ with.’ An’ he was right. I’ve bin an idiot. I’m\\nnot botherin’ with her no more, I promise yeh that.\\nBig bones ... I’ll give her big bones.”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another\\nnervously; Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast-\\nEnded Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid that\\nhe had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime,\\nbut Hagrid was still talking, apparently unaware that\\nhe had said anything odd.\\n“Yeh know wha’, Harry?” he said, looking up from the\\nphotograph of his father, his eyes very bright, “when I\\nfirs’ met you, you reminded me o’ me a bit. Mum an’\\nDad gone, an’ you was feelin’ like yeh wouldn’ fit in at\\nHogwarts, remember? Not sure yeh were really up to\\nit ... an’ now look at yeh, Harry! School champion!”\\nHe looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very\\nseriously, “Yeh know what I’d love, Harry? I’d love yeh\\nter win, I really would. It’d show ’em all ... yeh don’\\nhave ter be pureblood ter do it. Yeh don’ have ter be\\nashamed of what yeh are. It’d show ’em Dumbledore’s\\nthe one who’s got it righ’, lettin’ anyone in as long as\\nthey can do magic. How you doin’ with that egg,\\nHarry?”\\n“Great,” said Harry. “Really great.”\\nHagrid ’s miserable face broke into a wide, watery\\nsmile.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Tha’s my boy ... you show ’em, Harry, you show ’em.\\nBeat ’em all.”\\nLying to Hagrid wasn’t quite like lying to anyone else.\\nHarry went back to the castle later that afternoon\\nwith Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the image\\nof the happy expression on Hagrid’s whiskery face as\\nhe had imagined Harry winning the tournament. The\\nincomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever\\non Harry’s conscience that evening, and by the time\\nhe had got into bed, he had made up his mind — it\\nwas time to shelve his pride and see if Cedric’s hint\\nwas worth anything.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE EGG AND THE EYE\\nAs Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need\\nto work out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to\\ndo it at night, when he would be able to take as much\\ntime as he wanted. Reluctant though he was to accept\\nmore favours from Cedric, he also decided to use the\\nprefects’ bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in\\nthere, so it was much less likely that he would be\\ndisturbed.\\nHarry planned his excursion carefully, because he\\nhad been caught out of bed and out-of-bounds by\\nFilch the caretaker in the middle of the night once\\nbefore, and had no desire to repeat the experience.\\nThe Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential,\\nand as an added precaution, Harry thought he would\\ntake the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the cloak,\\nwas the most useful aid to rule-breaking Harry\\nowned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts,\\nincluding its many shortcuts and secret passageways\\nand, most important of all, it revealed the people\\ninside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving\\naround the corridors, so that Harry would be\\n \\nforewarned if somebody was approaching the\\nbathroom.\\nOn Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on\\nthe cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had\\ndone on the night when Hagrid had shown him the\\ndragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This\\ntime it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat\\nLady the password (“banana fritters”). “Good luck,”\\nRon muttered, climbing into the room as Harry crept\\nout past him.\\nIt was awkward moving under the cloak tonight,\\nbecause Harry had the heavy egg under one arm and\\nthe map held in front of his nose with the other.\\nHowever, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent,\\nand by checking the map at strategic intervals, Harry\\nwas able to ensure that he wouldn’t run into anyone\\nhe wanted to avoid. When he reached the statue of\\nBoris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his\\ngloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door,\\nleaned close to it, and muttered the password, “Pine\\nfresh,” just as Cedric had told him.\\nThe door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted\\nthe door behind him, and pulled off the Invisibility\\nCloak, looking around.\\nHis immediate reaction was that it would be worth\\nbecoming a prefect just to be able to use this\\nbathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled\\nchandelier, and everything was made of white marble,\\nincluding what looked like an empty, rectangular\\nswimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor.\\nAbout a hundred golden taps stood all around the\\npool’s edges, each with a differently colored jewel set\\ninto its handle. There was also a diving board. Long\\nwhite linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile\\nof fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a\\n \\nsingle golden-framed painting on the wall. It featured\\na blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her\\nlong hair over her face. It fluttered every time she\\nsnored.\\nHarry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps\\nechoing off the walls. Magnificent though the\\nbathroom was — and quite keen though he was to try\\nout a few of those taps — now he was here he\\ncouldn’t quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might\\nhave been having him on. How on earth was this\\nsupposed to help solve the mystery of the egg?\\nNevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, the\\ncloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the\\nswimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and\\nturned on a few of the taps.\\nHe could tell at once that they carried different sorts\\nof bubble bath mixed with the water, though it wasn’t\\nbubble bath as Harry had ever experienced it. One\\ntap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of\\nfootballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that\\nHarry thought it would have supported his weight if\\nhe’d cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed\\npurple clouds hovering over the surface of the water.\\nHarry amused himself for a while turning the taps on\\nand off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose\\njet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs.\\nThen, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam,\\nand bubbles, which took a very short time\\nconsidering its size, Harry turned off all the taps,\\npulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown,\\nand slid into the water.\\nIt was so deep that his feet barely touched the\\nbottom, and he actually did a couple of lengths before\\nswimming back to the side and treading water,\\nstaring at the egg. Highly enjoyable though it was to\\nswim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different-\\n \\ncolored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of\\nbrilliance came to him, no sudden burst of\\nunderstanding.\\nHarry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet\\nhands, and opened it. The wailing, screeching sound\\nfilled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the\\nmarble walls, but it sounded just as\\nincomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the\\nechoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the\\nsound would attract Filch, wondering whether that\\nhadn’t been Cedric’s plan — and then, making him\\njump so badly that he dropped the egg, which\\nclattered away across the bathroom floor, someone\\nspoke.\\n“I’d try putting it in the water, if I were you.”\\nHarry had swallowed a considerable amount of\\nbubbles in shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw\\nthe ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-\\nlegged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning\\nMyrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S-\\nbend of a toilet three floors below.\\n“Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage, “I’m — I’m not\\nwearing anything!”\\nThe foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but\\nhe had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on\\nhim from out of one of the taps ever since he had\\narrived.\\n“I closed my eyes when you got in,” she said, blinking\\nat him through her thick spectacles. “You haven’t\\nbeen to see me for ages.”\\n“Yeah ... well ...” said Harry, bending his knees\\nslightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn’t\\n \\nsee anything but his head, “I’m not supposed to come\\ninto your bathroom, am I? It’s a girls’ one.”\\n“You didn’t used to care,” said Myrtle miserably. “You\\nused to be in there all the time.”\\nThis was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione had found Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a\\nconvenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret —\\na forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into\\nliving replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so\\nthat they could sneak into the Slytherin common\\nroom.\\n“I got told off for going in there,” said Harry, which\\nwas half-true; Percy had once caught him coming out\\nof Myrtle’s bathroom. “I thought I’d better not come\\nback after that.”\\n“Oh ... I see ...” said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her\\nchin in a morose sort of way. “Well... anyway ... I’d try\\nthe egg in the water. That’s what Cedric Diggory did.”\\n“Have you been spying on him too?” said Harry\\nindignantly. “What d’you do, sneak up here in the\\nevenings to watch the prefects take baths?”\\n“Sometimes,” said Myrtle, rather slyly, “but I’ve never\\ncome out to speak to anyone before.”\\n“I’m honored,” said Harry darkly. “You keep your eyes\\nshut!”\\nHe made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered\\nbefore hoisting himself out of the bath, wrapping the\\ntowel firmly around his waist, and going to retrieve\\nthe egg. Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered\\nthrough her fingers and said, “Go on, then . . . open it\\nunder the water!”\\n \\nHarry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and\\nopened it ... and this time, it did not wail. A gurgling\\nsong was coming out of it, a song whose words he\\ncouldn’t distinguish through the water.\\n“You need to put your head under too,” said Myrtle,\\nwho seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him\\naround. “Go on!”\\nHarry took a great breath and slid under the surface\\n— and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the\\nbubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices\\nsinging to him from the open egg in his hands:\\n“Come seek us where our voices sound,\\nWe cannot sing above the ground,\\nAnd while you’re searching ponder this:\\nWe’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss,\\nAn hour long you’ll have to look,\\nAnd to recover what we took,\\nBut past an hour — the prospect’s black,\\nToo late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.”\\nHarry let himself float back upward and broke the\\nbubbly surface, shaking his hair out of his eyes.\\n“Hear it?” said Myrtle.\\n“Yeah ... ‘Come seek us where our voices sound ...’\\nand if I need persuading . . . hang on, I need to listen\\nagain. ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHe sank back beneath the water. It took three more\\nunderwater renditions of the egg’s song before Harry\\nhad it memorized; then he trod water for a while,\\nthinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him.\\n“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their\\nvoices above the ground. ...” he said slowly. “Er ...\\nwho could that be?”\\n“Slow, aren’t you?”\\nHe had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart\\nfrom the day when a dose of Polyjuice Potion had\\ngiven Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat. Harry\\nstared around the bathroom, thinking ... if the voices\\ncould only be heard underwater, then it made sense\\nfor them to belong to underwater creatures. He ran\\nthis theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.\\n“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay\\nthere talking to himself for ages about it. Ages and\\nages ... nearly all the bubbles had gone. ...”\\n“Underwater ...” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle ... what\\nlives in the lake, apart from the giant squid?”\\n“Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there\\n... sometimes don’t have any choice, if someone\\nflushes my toilet when I’m not expecting it. ...”\\nTrying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming\\ndown a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet,\\nHarry said, “Well, does anything in there have a\\nhuman voice? Hang on — ”\\nHarry’s eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing\\nmermaid on the wall.\\n“Myrtle, there aren’t merpeople in there, are there?”\\n \\n“Oooh, very good,” she said, her thick glasses\\ntwinkling, “it took Diggory much longer than that!\\nAnd that was with her awake too” — Myrtle jerked her\\nhead toward the mermaid with an expression of great\\ndislike on her glum face — “giggling and showing off\\nand flashing her fins. ...”\\n“That’s it, isn’t it?” said Harry excitedly. “The second\\ntask’s to go and find the merpeople in the lake and . . .\\nand ...”\\nBut he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he\\nfelt the excitement drain out of him as though\\nsomeone had just pulled a plug in his stomach. He\\nwasn’t a very good swimmer; he’d never had much\\npractice. Dudley had had lessons in his youth, but\\nAunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping\\nthat Harry would drown one day, hadn’t bothered to\\ngive him any. A couple of lengths of this bath were all\\nvery well, but that lake was very large, and very deep\\n. . . and merpeople would surely live right at the\\nbottom. ...\\n“Myrtle,” Harry said slowly, “how am I supposed to\\nbreathe ?”\\nAt this, Myrtle’s eyes filled with sudden tears again.\\n“Tactless!” she muttered, groping in her robes for a\\nhandkerchief.\\n“What’s tactless?” said Harry, bewildered.\\n“Talking about breathing in front of me!” she said\\nshrilly, and her voice echoed loudly around the\\nbathroom. “When I can’t ... when I haven’t ... not for\\nages ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nShe buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed\\nloudly. Harry remembered how touchy Myrtle had\\nalways been about being dead, but none of the other\\nghosts he knew made such a fuss about it.\\n“Sorry,” he said impatiently. “I didn’t mean — I just\\nforgot ...”\\n“Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle’s dead,” said\\nMyrtle, gulping, looking at him out of swollen eyes.\\n“Nobody missed me even when I was alive. Took them\\nhours and hours to find my body — I know, I was\\nsitting there waiting for them. Olive Hornby came into\\nthe bathroom — ‘Are you in here again, sulking,\\nMyrtle?’ she said, ‘because Professor Dippet asked me\\nto look for you — ’ And then she saw my body . . .\\nooooh, she didn’t forget it until her dying day, I made\\nsure of that . . . followed her around and reminded her,\\nI did. I remember at her brother’s wedding — ”\\nBut Harry wasn’t listening; he was thinking about the\\nmerpeople’s song again. “We’ve taken what you’ll\\nsorely miss.” That sounded as though they were going\\nto steal something of his, something he had to get\\nback. What were they going to take?\\n“ — and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of\\nMagic to stop me stalking her, so I had to come back\\nhere and live in my toilet.”\\n“Good,” said Harry vaguely. “Well, I’m a lot further on\\nthan I was. ... Shut your eyes again, will you? I’m\\ngetting out.”\\nHe retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath,\\nclimbed out, dried himself, and pulled on his pajamas\\nand dressing gown again.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again\\nsometime?” Moaning Myrtle asked mournfully as\\nHarry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.\\n“Er ... I’ll try,” Harry said, though privately thinking\\nthe only way he’d be visiting Myrtle’s bathroom again\\nwas if every other toilet in the castle got blocked. “See\\nyou, Myrtle ... thanks for your help.”\\n“ ’Bye, ’bye,” she said gloomily, and as Harry put on\\nthe Invisibility Cloak he saw her zoom back up the\\ntap.\\nOut in the dark corridor, Harry examined the\\nMarauder’s Map to check that the coast was still\\nclear. Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his cat,\\nMrs. Norris, were safely in their office ... nothing else\\nseemed to be moving apart from Peeves, though he\\nwas bouncing around the trophy room on the floor\\nabove. ... Harry had taken his first step back toward\\nGryffindor Tower when something else on the map\\ncaught his eye ... something distinctly odd.\\nPeeves was not the only thing that was moving. A\\nsingle dot was flitting around a room in the bottom\\nleft-hand corner — Snape’s office. But the dot wasn’t\\nlabeled “Severus Snape” ... it was Bartemius Crouch.\\nHarry stared at the dot. Mr. Crouch was supposed to\\nbe too ill to go to work or to come to the Yule Ball —\\nso what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one\\no’clock in the morning? Harry watched closely as the\\ndot moved around and around the room, pausing\\nhere and there. ...\\nHarry hesitated, thinking . . . and then his curiosity got\\nthe better of him. He turned and set off in the\\nopposite direction toward the nearest staircase. He\\nwas going to see what Crouch was up to.\\n \\nHarry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible,\\nthough the faces in some of the portraits still turned\\ncuriously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of\\nhis pajamas. He crept along the corridor below,\\npushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and\\nproceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that\\nwould take him down two floors. He kept glancing\\ndown at the map, wondering ... It just didn’t seem in\\ncharacter, somehow, for correct, law-abiding Mr.\\nCrouch to be sneaking around somebody else’s office\\nthis late at night. ...\\nAnd then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking\\nabout what he was doing, not concentrating on\\nanything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch,\\nHarry’s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step\\nNeville always forgot to jump. He gave an ungainly\\nwobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath,\\nslipped from under his arm. He lurched forward to try\\nand catch it, but too late; the egg fell down the long\\nstaircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on\\nevery step — the Invisibility Cloak slipped — Harry\\nsnatched at it, and the Marauder’s Map fluttered out\\nof his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in\\nthe step to above his knee, he couldn’t reach it.\\nThe golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom\\nof the staircase, burst open, and began wailing loudly\\nin the corridor below. Harry pulled out his wand and\\nstruggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it\\nblank, but it was too far away to reach —\\nPulling the cloak back over himself Harry\\nstraightened up, listening hard with his eyes screwed\\nup with fear ... and, almost immediately —\\n“PEEVES!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nIt was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the\\ncaretaker. Harry could hear his rapid, shuffling\\nfootsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice\\nraised in fury.\\n“What’s this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will\\nyou? I’ll have you, Peeves, I’ll have you, you’ll ... and\\nwhat is this?”\\nFilch ’s footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on\\nmetal and the wailing stopped — Filch had picked up\\nthe egg and closed it. Harry stood very still, one leg\\nstill jammed tightly in the magical step, listening. Any\\nmoment now, Filch was going to pull aside the\\ntapestry, expecting to see Peeves . . . and there would\\nbe no Peeves ... but if he came up the stairs, he would\\nspot the Marauder’s Map ... and Invisibility Cloak or\\nnot, the map would show “Harry Potter” standing\\nexactly where he was.\\n“Egg?” Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. “My\\nsweet!” — Mrs. Norris was obviously with him — “This\\nis a Triwizard clue! This belongs to a school\\nchampion!”\\nHarry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast —\\n“PEEVES!” Filch roared gleefully. “You’ve been\\nstealing!”\\nHe ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his\\nhorrible, pouchy face and bulging, pale eyes staring\\nup the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase.\\n“Hiding, are you?” he said softly. “I’m coming to get\\nyou, Peeves. ... You’ve gone and stolen a Tri wizard\\nclue, Peeves. ... Dumbledore’ll have you out of here\\nfor this, you filthy, pilfering poltergeist. ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nFilch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-\\ncolored cat at his heels. Mrs. Norris’s lamp-like eyes,\\nso very like her master’s, were fixed directly upon\\nHarry. He had had occasion before now to wonder\\nwhether the Invisibility Cloak worked on cats. ... Sick\\nwith apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer\\nand nearer in his old flannel dressing gown — he\\ntried desperately to pull his trapped leg free, but it\\nmerely sank a few more inches — any second now,\\nFilch was going to spot the map or walk right into him\\n“Filch? What’s going on?”\\nFilch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At\\nthe foot of the stairs stood the only person who could\\nmake Harry’s situation worse: Snape. He was wearing\\na long gray nightshirt and he looked livid.\\n“It’s Peeves, Professor,” Filch whispered malevolently.\\n“He threw this egg down the stairs.”\\nSnape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped\\nbeside Filch. Harry gritted his teeth, convinced his\\nloudly thumping heart would give him away at any\\nsecond. ...\\n“Peeves?” said Snape softly, staring at the egg in\\nFilch’s hands. “But Peeves couldn’t get into my office.\\n“This egg was in your office, Professor?”\\n“Of course not,” Snape snapped. “I heard banging and\\nwailing — ”\\n“Yes, Professor, that was the egg — ”\\n“ — I was coming to investigate — ”\\n \\n“ — Peeves threw it, Professor — ”\\n“ — and when I passed my office, I saw that the\\ntorches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar!\\nSomebody has been searching it!”\\n“But Peeves couldn’t — ”\\n“I know he couldn’t, Filch!” Snape snapped again. “I\\nseal my office with a spell none but a wizard could\\nbreak!” Snape looked up the stairs, straight through\\nHarry, and then down into the corridor below. “I want\\nyou to come and help me search for the intruder,\\nFilch.”\\n“I — yes, Professor — but — ”\\nFilch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through\\nHarry, who could see that he was very reluctant to\\nforgo the chance of cornering Peeves. Go, Harry\\npleaded with him silently, go with Snape ... go ... Mrs.\\nNorris was peering around Filch ’s legs. ... Harry had\\nthe distinct impression that she could smell him. ...\\nWhy had he filled that bath with so much perfumed\\nfoam?\\n“The thing is, Professor,” said Filch plaintively, “the\\nheadmaster will have to listen to me this time. Peeves\\nhas been stealing from a student, it might be my\\nchance to get him thrown out of the castle once and\\nfor all — ”\\n“Filch, I don’t give a damn about that wretched\\npoltergeist; it’s my office that’s — ”\\nClunk. Clunk. Clunk.\\nSnape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch\\nboth looked down at the foot of the stairs. Harry saw\\n \\nMad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow\\ngap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old\\ntraveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his\\nstaff as usual.\\n“Pajama party, is it?” he growled up the stairs.\\n“Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,” said\\nFilch at once. “Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things\\naround as usual — and then Professor Snape\\ndiscovered that someone had broken into his off — ”\\n“Shut up!” Snape hissed to Filch.\\nMoody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs.\\nHarry saw Moody’s magical eye travel over Snape, and\\nthen, unmistakably, onto himself.\\nHarry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see\\nthrough Invisibility Cloaks ... he alone could see the\\nfull strangeness of the scene: Snape in his nightshirt,\\nFilch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the\\nstairs behind them. Moody’s lopsided gash of a mouth\\nopened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry\\nstared straight into each other’s eyes. Then Moody\\nclosed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape\\nagain.\\n“Did I hear that correctly, Snape?” he asked slowly.\\n“Someone broke into your office?”\\n“It is unimportant,” said Snape coldly.\\n“On the contrary,” growled Moody, “it is very\\nimportant. Who’d want to break into your office?”\\n“A student, I daresay,” said Snape. Harry could see a\\nvein flickering horribly on Snape ’s greasy temple. “It\\nhas happened before. Potion ingredients have gone\\n \\nmissing from my private store cupboard ... students\\nattempting illicit mixtures, no doubt. ...”\\n“Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?” said\\nMoody. “Not hiding anything else in your office, are\\nyou?”\\nHarry saw the edge of Snape ’s sallow face turn a\\nnasty brick color, the vein in his temple pulsing more\\nrapidly.\\n“You know I’m hiding nothing, Moody,” he said in a\\nsoft and dangerous voice, “as you’ve searched my\\noffice pretty thoroughly yourself.”\\nMoody’s face twisted into a smile. “Auror’s privilege,\\nSnape. Dumbledore told me to keep an eye — ”\\n“Dumbledore happens to trust me,” said Snape\\nthrough clenched teeth. “I refuse to believe that he\\ngave you orders to search my office!”\\n“ ’Course Dumbledore trusts you,” growled Moody.\\n“He’s a trusting man, isn’t he? Believes in second\\nchances. But me — I say there are spots that don’t\\ncome off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d’you\\nknow what I mean?”\\nSnape suddenly did something very strange. He\\nseized his left forearm convulsively with his right\\nhand, as though something on it had hurt him.\\nMoody laughed. “Get back to bed, Snape.”\\n“You don’t have the authority to send me anywhere!”\\nSnape hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry\\nwith himself. “I have as much right to prowl this\\nschool after dark as you do!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Prowl away,” said Moody, but his voice was full of\\nmenace. “I look forward to meeting you in a dark\\ncorridor some time. ... You’ve dropped something, by\\nthe way. ...”\\nWith a stab of horror, Harry saw Moody point at the\\nMarauder’s Map, still lying on the staircase six steps\\nbelow him. As Snape and Filch both turned to look at\\nit, Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised his\\narms under the cloak and waved furiously at Moody\\nto attract his attention, mouthing “It’s mine! Mine!”\\nSnape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of\\ndawning comprehension on his face —\\n“Accio Parchments\\nThe map flew up into the air, slipped through Snape ’s\\noutstretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into\\nMoody’s hand.\\n“My mistake,” Moody said calmly. “It’s mine —\\nmust’ve dropped it earlier — ”\\nBut Snape ’s black eyes were darting from the egg in\\nFilch’s arms to the map in Moody’s hand, and Harry\\ncould tell he was putting two and two together, as\\nonly Snape could. ...\\n“Potter,” he said quietly.\\n“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map\\nand pocketing it.\\n“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his\\nhead and stared right at the place where Harry was,\\nas though he could suddenly see him. “That egg is\\nPotter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nPotter. I have seen it before, I recognize it! Potter is\\nhere! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!”\\nSnape stretched out his hands like a blind man and\\nbegan to move up the stairs; Harry could have sworn\\nhis over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff\\nHarry out — trapped, Harry leaned backward, trying\\nto avoid Snape’s fingertips, but any moment now —\\n“There’s nothing there, Snape!” barked Moody, “but\\nI’ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your\\nmind jumped to Harry Potter!”\\n“Meaning what?” Snape turned again to look at\\nMoody, his hands still outstretched, inches from\\nHarry’s chest.\\n“Meaning that Dumbledore’s very interested to know\\nwho’s got it in for that boy!” said Moody, limping\\nnearer still to the foot of the stairs. “And so am I,\\nSnape ... very interested. ...” The torchlight flickered\\nacross his mangled face, so that the scars, and the\\nchunk missing from his nose, looked deeper and\\ndarker than ever.\\nSnape was looking down at Moody, and Harry\\ncouldn’t see the expression on his face. For a\\nmoment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape\\nslowly lowered his hands.\\n“I merely thought,” said Snape, in a voice of forced\\ncalm, “that if Potter was wandering around after\\nhours again ... it’s an unfortunate habit of his ... he\\nshould be stopped. For — for his own safety.”\\n“Ah, I see,” said Moody softly. “Got Potter’s best\\ninterests at heart, have you?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThere was a pause. Snape and Moody were still\\nstaring at each other. Mrs. Norris gave a loud meow,\\nstill peering around Filch’s legs, looking for the source\\nof Harry’s bubble-bath smell.\\n“I think I will go back to bed,” Snape said curtly.\\n“Best idea you’ve had all night,” said Moody. “Now,\\nFilch, if you’ll just give me that egg — ”\\n“No!” said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were\\nhis firstborn son. “Professor Moody, this is evidence of\\nPeeves’ treachery!”\\n“It’s the property of the champion he stole it from,”\\nsaid Moody. “Hand it over, now.”\\nSnape swept downstairs and passed Moody without\\nanother word. Filch made a chirruping noise to Mrs.\\nNorris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few more\\nseconds before turning and following her master. Still\\nbreathing very fast, Harry heard Snape walking away\\ndown the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and\\ndisappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris.\\n“Never mind, my sweet ... we’ll see Dumbledore in the\\nmorning ... tell him what Peeves was up to. ...”\\nA door slammed. Harry was left staring down at\\nMoody, who placed his staff on the bottommost stair\\nand started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull\\nclunk on every other step.\\n“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.\\n“Yeah ... I — er ... thanks,” said Harry weakly.\\n“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the\\nMarauders Map out of his pocket and unfolding it.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was\\ngoing to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg\\nwas really hurting him.\\n“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the\\nmap, his magical eye going haywire. “This ... this is\\nsome map, Potter!”\\n“Yeah, it’s ... quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were\\nstarting to water from the pain. “Er — Professor\\nMoody, d’you think you could help me — ?”\\n“What? Oh! Yes ... yes, of course ...”\\nMoody took hold of Harry’s arms and pulled; Harry’s\\nleg came free of the trick step, and he climbed onto\\nthe one above it. Moody was still gazing at the map.\\n“Potter ...” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any\\nchance, to see who broke into Snape’s office, did you?\\nOn this map, I mean?”\\n“Er ... yeah, I did ...” Harry admitted. “It was Mr.\\nCrouch.”\\nMoody’s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of\\nthe map. He looked suddenly alarmed.\\n“Crouch?” he said. “You’re — you’re sure, Potter?”\\n“Positive,” said Harry.\\n“Well, he’s not here anymore,” said Moody, his eye\\nstill whizzing over the map. “Crouch ... that’s very —\\nvery interesting. ...”\\nHe said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at\\nthe map. Harry could tell that this news meant\\nsomething to Moody and very much wanted to know\\n \\nwhat it was. He wondered whether he dared ask.\\nMoody scared him slightly ... yet Moody had just\\nhelped him avoid an awful lot of trouble. ...\\n“Er ... Professor Moody ... why d’you reckon Mr.\\nCrouch wanted to look around S nape’s office?”\\nMoody’s magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering,\\nupon Harry. It was a penetrating glare, and Harry had\\nthe impression that Moody was sizing him up,\\nwondering whether to answer or not, or how much to\\ntell him.\\n“Put it this way, Potter,” Moody muttered finally, “they\\nsay old Mad-Eye’s obsessed with catching Dark\\nwizards ... but I’m nothing — nothing — compared to\\nBarty Crouch.”\\nHe continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning\\nto know more.\\n“Professor Moody?” he said again. “D’you think ...\\ncould this have anything to do with . . . maybe Mr.\\nCrouch thinks there’s something going on. ...”\\n“Like what?” said Moody sharply.\\nHarry wondered how much he dare say. He didn’t\\nwant Moody to guess that he had a source of\\ninformation outside Hogwarts; that might lead to\\ntricky questions about Sirius.\\n“I don’t know,” Harry muttered, “odd stuff’s been\\nhappening lately, hasn’t it? It’s been in the Daily\\nProphet ... the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the\\nDeath Eaters and everything. ...”\\nBoth of Moody’s mismatched eyes widened.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You’re a sharp boy, Potter,” he said. His magical eye\\nroved back to the Marauder’s Map. “Crouch could be\\nthinking along those lines,” he said slowly. “Very\\npossible ... there have been some funny rumors flying\\naround lately — helped along by Rita Skeeter, of\\ncourse. It’s making a lot of people nervous, I reckon.”\\nA grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth. “Oh if\\nthere’s one thing I hate,” he muttered, more to himself\\nthan to Harry, and his magical eye was fixed on the\\nleft-hand corner of the map, “it’s a Death Eater who\\nwalked free. ...”\\nHarry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean\\nwhat Harry thought he meant?\\n“And now I want to ask you a question, Potter,” said\\nMoody in a more businesslike tone.\\nHarry’s heart sank; he had thought this was coming.\\nMoody was going to ask where he had got this map,\\nwhich was a very dubious magical object — and the\\nstory of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated\\nnot only him, but his own father, Fred and George\\nWeasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the map\\nin front of Harry, who braced himself —\\n“Can I borrow this?”\\n“Oh!” said Harry.\\nHe was very fond of his map, but on the other hand,\\nhe was extremely relieved that Moody wasn’t asking\\nwhere he’d got it, and there was no doubt that he\\nowed Moody a favor.\\n“Yeah, okay.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Good boy,” growled Moody. “I can make good use of\\nthis ... this might be exactly what I’ve been looking\\nfor. ... Right, bed, Potter, come on, now. ...”\\nThey climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody\\nstill examining the map as though it was a treasure\\nthe like of which he had never seen before. They\\nwalked in silence to the door of Moody’s office, where\\nhe stopped and looked up at Harry.\\n“You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?”\\n“No,” said Harry, taken aback.\\n“You want to consider it,” said Moody, nodding and\\nlooking at Harry thoughtfully. “Yes, indeed ... and\\nincidentally ... I’m guessing you weren’t just taking\\nthat egg for a walk tonight?”\\n“Er — no,” said Harry, grinning. “I’ve been working\\nout the clue.”\\nMoody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire\\nagain.\\n“Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas,\\nPotter. ... See you in the morning. ...”\\nHe went back into his office, staring down at the\\nMarauder’s Map again, and closed the door behind\\nhim.\\nHarry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in\\nthought about Snape, and Crouch, and what it all\\nmeant. ... Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he\\ncould manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to?\\nWhat did he think Snape was concealing in his office?\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nAnd Moody thought he, Harry, ought to be an Auror!\\nInteresting idea . . . but somehow, Harry thought, as\\nhe got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later,\\nthe egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, he\\nthought he’d like to check how scarred the rest of\\nthem were before he chose it as a career.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE SECOND TASK\\n“You said you’d already worked out that egg clue!”\\nsaid Hermione indignantly.\\n“Keep your voice down!” said Harry crossly. “I just\\nneed to — sort of fine-tune it, all right?”\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back\\nof the Charms class with a table to themselves. They\\nwere supposed to be practicing the opposite of the\\nSummoning Charm today — the Banishing Charm.\\nOwing to the potential for nasty accidents when\\nobjects kept flying across the room, Professor Flitwick\\nhad given each student a stack of cushions on which\\nto practice, the theory being that these wouldn’t hurt\\nanyone if they went off target. It was a good theory,\\nbut it wasn’t working very well. Neville’s aim was so\\npoor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier\\nthings flying across the room — Professor Flitwick, for\\ninstance.\\n“Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?” Harry\\nhissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly\\n \\npast them, landing on top of a large cabinet. “I’m\\ntrying to tell you about Snape and Moody. ...”\\nThis class was an ideal cover for a private\\nconversation, as everyone was having far too much\\nfun to pay them any attention. Harry had been\\nrecounting his adventures of the previous night in\\nwhispered installments for the last half hour.\\n“Snape said Moody’s searched his office as well?” Ron\\nwhispered, his eyes alight with interest as he\\nBanished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it\\nsoared into the air and knocked Parvati’s hat off).\\n“What ... d’you reckon Moody’s here to keep an eye on\\nSnape as well as Karkaroff?”\\n“Well, I dunno if that’s what Dumbledore asked him\\nto do, but he’s definitely doing it,” said Harry, waving\\nhis wand without paying much attention, so that his\\ncushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk.\\n“Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here\\nbecause he’s giving him a second chance or\\nsomething. ...”\\n“What?” said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion\\nspinning high into the air, ricocheting off the\\nchandelier, and dropping heavily onto Flitwick’s desk.\\n“Harry . . . maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name\\nin the Goblet of Fire!”\\n“Oh Ron,” said Hermione, shaking her head\\nsceptically, “we thought Snape was trying to kill\\nHarry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry’s\\nlife, remember?”\\nShe Banished a cushion and it flew across the room\\nand landed in the box they were all supposed to be\\naiming at. Harry looked at Hermione, thinking ... it\\nwas true that Snape had saved his life once, but the\\n \\nodd thing was, Snape definitely loathed him, just as\\nhe’d loathed Harry’s father when they had been at\\nschool together. Snape loved taking points from\\nHarry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity\\nto give him punishments, or even to suggest that he\\nshould be suspended from the school.\\n“I don’t care what Moody says,” Hermione went on.\\n“Dumbledore’s not stupid. He was right to trust\\nHagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of\\npeople wouldn’t have given them jobs, so why\\nshouldn’t he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a\\nbit — ”\\n“ — evil,” said Ron promptly. “Come on, Hermione,\\nwhy are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his\\noffice, then?”\\n“Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?” said\\nHermione, ignoring Ron. “It’s a bit funny, isn’t it, that\\nhe can’t manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can\\nget up here in the middle of the night when he wants\\nto?”\\n“You just don’t like Crouch because of that elf,\\nWinky,” said Ron, sending a cushion soaring into the\\nwindow.\\n“You just want to think Snape’s up to something,”\\nsaid Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly\\ninto the box.\\n“I just want to know what Snape did with his first\\nchance, if he’s on his second one,” said Harry grimly,\\nand his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew\\nstraight across the room and landed neatly on top of\\nHermione ’s.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nObedient to Sirius’s wish of hearing about anything\\nodd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown\\nowl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch\\nbreaking into Snape’s office, and Moody and Snape’s\\nconversation. Then Harry turned his attention in\\nearnest to the most urgent problem facing him: how\\nto survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-\\nfourth of February.\\nRon quite liked the idea of using the Summoning\\nCharm again — Harry had explained about Aqua-\\nLungs, and Ron couldn’t see why Harry shouldn’t\\nSummon one from the nearest Muggle town.\\nHermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in\\nthe unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how\\nto operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an\\nhour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the\\nInternational Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it was too\\nmuch to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-\\nLung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.\\n“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to\\nTransfigure yourself into a submarine or something,”\\nHermione said. “If only we’d done human\\nTransfiguration already! But I don’t think we start\\nthat until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you\\ndon’t know what you’re doing. ...”\\n“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope\\nsticking out of my head,” said Harry. “I s’pose I could\\nalways attack someone in front of Moody; he might do\\nit for me. ...”\\n“I don’t think he’d let you choose what you wanted to\\nbe turned into, though,” said Hermione seriously.\\n“No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm.”\\nSo Harry, thinking that he would soon have had\\nenough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried\\n \\nhimself once more among the dusty volumes, looking\\nfor any spell that might enable a human to survive\\nwithout oxygen. However, though he, Ron, and\\nHermione searched through their lunchtimes,\\nevenings, and whole weekends — though Harry asked\\nProfessor McGonagall for a note of permission to use\\nthe Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable,\\nvulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help — they\\nfound nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to\\nspend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.\\nFamiliar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb\\nHarry now, and he was finding it difficult to\\nconcentrate in class again. The lake, which Harry had\\nalways taken for granted as just another feature of\\nthe grounds, drew his eyes whenever he was near a\\nclassroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly\\nwater, whose dark and icy depths were starting to\\nseem as distant as the moon.\\nJust as it had before he faced the Horntail, time was\\nslipping away as though somebody had bewitched the\\nclocks to go extra-fast. There was a week to go before\\nFebruary the twenty-fourth (there was still time) ...\\nthere were five days to go (he was bound to find\\nsomething soon) ... three days to go (please let me find\\nsomething . . . please) . . .\\nWith two days left, Harry started to go off food again.\\nThe only good thing about breakfast on Monday was\\nthe return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius. He\\npulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the\\nshortest letter Sirius had ever written to him.\\nSend date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl.\\nHarry turned the parchment over and looked at the\\nback, hoping to see something else, but it was blank.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Weekend after next,” whispered Hermione, who had\\nread the note over Harry’s shoulder. “Here — take my\\nquill and send this owl back straight away.”\\nHarry scribbled the dates down on the back of\\nSirius’s letter, tied it onto the brown owl’s leg, and\\nwatched it take flight again. What had he expected?\\nAdvice on how to survive underwater? He had been so\\nintent on telling Sirius all about Snape and Moody he\\nhad completely forgotten to mention the egg’s clue.\\n“What’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade\\nweekend for?” said Ron.\\n“Dunno,” said Harry dully. The momentary happiness\\nthat had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had\\ndied. “Come on ... Care of Magical Creatures.”\\nWhether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast-\\nEnded Skrewts, or because there were now only two\\nskrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he\\ncould do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank\\ncould, Harry didn’t know, but Hagrid had been\\ncontinuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he’d\\nreturned to work. It turned out that Hagrid knew\\nquite as much about unicorns as he did about\\nmonsters, though it was clear that he found their lack\\nof poisonous fangs disappointing.\\nToday he had managed to capture two unicorn foals.\\nUnlike full-grown unicorns, they were pure gold.\\nParvati and Lavender went into transports of delight\\nat the sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had\\nto work hard to conceal how much she liked them.\\n“Easier ter spot than the adults,” Hagrid told the\\nclass. “They turn silver when they’re abou’ two years\\nold, an’ they grow horns at aroun’ four. Don’ go pure\\nwhite till they’re full grown, ’round about seven.\\n \\nThey’re a bit more trustin’ when they’re babies ... don’\\nmind boys so much. ... C’mon, move in a bit, yeh can\\npat ’em if yeh want ... give ’em a few o’ these sugar\\nlumps. ...\\n“You okay, Harry?” Hagrid muttered, moving aside\\nslightly, while most of the others swarmed around the\\nbaby unicorns.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry.\\n“Jus’ nervous, eh?” said Hagrid.\\n“Bit,” said Harry.\\n“Harry,” said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his\\nshoulder, so that Harry’s knees buckled under its\\nweight, “I’d’ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on\\ntha’ Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin’ yeh\\nset yer mind ter. I’m not worried at all. Yeh’re goin’ ter\\nbe fine. Got yer clue worked out, haven’ yeh?”\\nHarry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge\\nto confess that he didn’t have any idea how to survive\\nat the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him.\\nHe looked up at Hagrid — perhaps he had to go into\\nthe lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it?\\nHe looked after everything else on the grounds, after\\nall —\\n“Yeh’re goin’ ter win,” Hagrid growled, patting Harry’s\\nshoulder again, so that Harry actually felt himself\\nsink a couple of inches into the soft ground. “I know\\nit. I can feel it. Yeh’re goin’ ter win, Harry.”\\nHarry just couldn’t bring himself to wipe the happy,\\nconfident smile off Hagrid ’s face. Pretending he was\\ninterested in the young unicorns, he forced a smile in\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nreturn, and moved forward to pat them with the\\nothers.\\nBy the evening before the second task, Harry felt as\\nthough he were trapped in a nightmare. He was fully\\naware that even if, by some miracle, he managed to\\nfind a suitable spell, he’d have a real job mastering it\\novernight. How could he have let this happen? Why\\nhadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner? Why\\nhad he ever let his mind wander in class — what if a\\nteacher had once mentioned how to breathe\\nunderwater?\\nHe sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the\\nsun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after\\npage of spells, hidden from one another by the\\nmassive piles of books on the desk in front of each of\\nthem. Harry’s heart gave a huge leap every time he\\nsaw the word “water” on a page, but more often than\\nnot it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a\\npound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt ...”\\n“I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly\\nfrom the other side of the table. “There’s nothing.\\nNothing. Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and\\nponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere\\nnear powerful enough to drain the lake.”\\n“There must be something,” Hermione muttered,\\nmoving a candle closer to her. Her eyes were so tired\\nshe was poring over the tiny print of Olde and\\nForgotten Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose\\nabout an inch from the page. “They’d never have set a\\ntask that was undoable.”\\n“They have,” said Ron. “Harry, just go down to the\\nlake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the\\nmerpeople to give back whatever they’ve nicked, and\\nsee if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate.”\\n \\n“There’s a way of doing it!” Hermione said crossly.\\n“There just has to be!”\\nShe seemed to be taking the library’s lack of useful\\ninformation on the subject as a personal insult; it had\\nnever failed her before.\\n“I know what I should have done,” said Harry, resting,\\nfacedown, on Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts. “I\\nshould’ve learned to be an Animagus like Sirius.”\\nAn Animagus was a wizard who could transform into\\nan animal.\\n“Yeah, you could’ve turned into a goldfish any time\\nyou wanted!” said Ron.\\n“Or a frog,” yawned Harry. He was exhausted.\\n“It takes years to become an Animagus, and then you\\nhave to register yourself and everything,” said\\nHermione vaguely, now squinting down the index of\\nWeird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their Solutions.\\n“Professor McGonagall told us, remember ... you’ve\\ngot to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic\\nOffice ... what animal you become, and your\\nmarkings, so you can’t abuse it. ...”\\n“Hermione, I was joking,” said Harry wearily. “I know I\\nhaven’t got a chance of turning into a frog by\\ntomorrow morning. ...”\\n“Oh this is no use,” Hermione said, snapping shut\\nWeird Wizarding Dilemmas. “Who on earth wants to\\nmake their nose hair grow into ringlets?”\\n“I wouldn’t mind,” said Fred Weasley’s voice. “Be a\\ntalking point, wouldn’t it?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Fred and\\nGeorge had just emerged from behind some\\nbookshelves.\\n“What’re you two doing here?” Ron asked.\\n“Looking for you,” said George. “McGonagall wants\\nyou, Ron. And you, Hermione.”\\n“Why?” said Hermione, looking surprised.\\n“Dunno ... she was looking a bit grim, though,” said\\nFred.\\n“We’re supposed to take you down to her office,” said\\nGeorge.\\nRon and Hermione stared at Harry, who felt his\\nstomach drop. Was Professor McGonagall about to tell\\nRon and Hermione off? Perhaps she’d noticed how\\nmuch they were helping him, when he ought to be\\nworking out how to do the task alone?\\n“Well meet you back in the common room,” Hermione\\ntold Harry as she got up to go with Ron — both of\\nthem looked very anxious. “Bring as many of these\\nbooks as you can, okay?”\\n“Right,” said Harry uneasily.\\nBy eight o’clock, Madam Pince had extinguished all\\nthe lamps and came to chivvy Harry out of the library.\\nStaggering under the weight of as many books as he\\ncould carry, Harry returned to the Gryffindor common\\nroom, pulled a table into a corner, and continued to\\nsearch. There was nothing in Madcap Magic for\\nWacky Warlocks . . . nothing in A Guide to Medieval\\nSorcery . . . not one mention of underwater exploits in\\nAn Anthology of Eighteenth-Century Charms, or in\\n \\nDreadful Denizens of the Deep, or Powers You Never\\nKnew You Had and What to Do with Them Now You’ve\\nWised Up.\\nCrookshanks crawled into Harry’s lap and curled up,\\npurring deeply. The common room emptied slowly\\naround Harry. People kept wishing him luck for the\\nnext morning in cheery, confident voices like Hagrid’s,\\nall of them apparently convinced that he was about to\\npull off another stunning performance like the one he\\nhad managed in the first task. Harry couldn’t answer\\nthem, he just nodded, feeling as though there were a\\ngolfball stuck in his throat. By ten to midnight, he\\nwas alone in the room with Crookshanks. He had\\nsearched all the remaining books, and Ron and\\nHermione had not come back.\\nIt’s over, he told himself. You can’t do it. You’ll just\\nhave to go down to the lake in the morning and tell\\nthe judges. ...\\nHe imagined himself explaining that he couldn’t do\\nthe task. He pictured Bagman’s look of round-eyed\\nsurprise, Karkaroff’s satisfied, yellow-toothed smile.\\nHe could almost hear Fleur Delacour saying “I knew it\\n... ’e is too young, ’e is only a little boy.” He saw Malfoy\\nflashing his POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the\\ncrowd, saw Hagrid’s crestfallen, disbelieving face. ...\\nForgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap, Harry\\nstood up very suddenly; Crookshanks hissed angrily\\nas he landed on the floor, gave Harry a disgusted\\nlook, and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the\\nair, but Harry was already hurrying up the spiral\\nstaircase to his dormitory. . . . He would grab the\\nInvisibility Cloak and go back to the library, he’d stay\\nthere all night if he had to. ...\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Lumos,” Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he\\nopened the library door.\\nWand tip alight, he crept along the bookshelves,\\npulling down more books — books of hexes and\\ncharms, books on merpeople and water monsters,\\nbooks on famous witches and wizards, on magical\\ninventions, on anything at all that might include one\\npassing reference to underwater survival. He carried\\nthem over to a table, then set to work, searching them\\nby the narrow beam of his wand, occasionally\\nchecking his watch. ...\\nOne in the morning . . . two in the morning . . . the only\\nway he could keep going was to tell himself, over and\\nover again, next book ...in the next one . . . the next one\\nThe mermaid in the painting in the prefects’\\nbathroom was laughing. Harry was bobbing like a\\ncork in bubbly water next to her rock, while she held\\nhis Firebolt over his head.\\n“Come and get it!” she giggled maliciously. “Come on,\\njump!”\\n“I can’t,” Harry panted, snatching at the Firebolt, and\\nstruggling not to sink. “Give it to me!”\\nBut she just poked him painfully in the side with the\\nend of the broomstick, laughing at him.\\n“That hurts — get off — ouch — ”\\n“Harry Potter must wake up, sir!”\\n“Stop poking me — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Dobby must poke Harry Potter, sir, he must wake\\nup!”\\nHarry opened his eyes. He was still in the library; the\\nInvisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he’d\\nslept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages\\nof Where There’s a Wand, There’s a Way. He sat up,\\nstraightening his glasses, blinking in the bright\\ndaylight.\\n“Harry Potter needs to hurry!” squeaked Dobby. “The\\nsecond task starts in ten minutes, and Harry Potter\\n“Ten minutes?” Harry croaked. “Ten — ten minutes?”\\nHe looked down at his watch. Dobby was right. It was\\ntwenty past nine. A large, dead weight seemed to fall\\nthrough Harry’s chest into his stomach.\\n“Hurry, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, plucking at\\nHarry’s sleeve. “You is supposed to be down by the\\nlake with the other champions, sir!”\\n“It’s too late, Dobby,” Harry said hopelessly. “I’m not\\ndoing the task, I don’t know how — ”\\n“Harry Potter will do the task!” squeaked the elf.\\n“Dobby knew Harry had not found the right book, so\\nDobby did it for him!”\\n“What?” said Harry. “But you don’t know what the\\nsecond task is — ”\\n“Dobby knows, sir! Harry Potter has to go into the\\nlake and find his Wheezy — ”\\n“Find my what?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“ — and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!”\\n“What’s a Wheezy?”\\n“Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy — Wheezy who is\\ngiving Dobby his sweater!”\\nDobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he\\nwas now wearing over his shorts.\\n“What?” Harry gasped. “They’ve got ... they’ve got\\nRon?”\\n“The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked\\nDobby. “ ‘But past an hour — ’ ”\\n“ — ‘the prospect’s black,’ ” Harry recited, staring,\\nhorror-struck, at the elf. “ ‘Too late, it’s gone, it won’t\\ncome back.’ Dobby — what’ve I got to do?”\\n“You has to eat this, sir!” squeaked the elf, and he put\\nhis hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a\\nball of what looked like slimy, grayish-green rat tails.\\n“Right before you go into the lake, sir — gillyweed!”\\n“What’s it do?” said Harry, staring at the gillyweed.\\n“It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!”\\n“Dobby,” said Harry frantically, “listen — are you sure\\nabout this?”\\nHe couldn’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had\\ntried to “help” him, he had ended up with no bones in\\nhis right arm.\\n“Dobby is quite sure, sir!” said the elf earnestly.\\n“Dobby hears things, sir, he is a house-elf, he goes all\\nover the castle as he lights the fires and mops the\\n \\nfloors. Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and\\nProfessor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the\\nnext task. . . . Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his\\nWheezy!”\\nHarry’s doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he\\npulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag,\\ngrabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then\\ntore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.\\n“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby\\nsquealed as they burst into the corridor. “Dobby will\\nbe missed — good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!”\\n“See you later, Dobby!” Harry shouted, and he\\nsprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three\\nat a time.\\nThe entrance hall contained a few last-minute\\nstragglers, all leaving the Great Hall after breakfast\\nand heading through the double oak doors to watch\\nthe second task. They stared as Harry flashed past,\\nsending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt\\ndown the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly\\ngrounds.\\nAs he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats\\nthat had encircled the dragons’ enclosure in\\nNovember were now ranged along the opposite bank,\\nrising in stands that were packed to the bursting\\npoint and reflected in the lake below. The excited\\nbabble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water\\nas Harry ran flat-out around the other side of the lake\\ntoward the judges, who were sitting at another gold-\\ndraped table at the water’s edge. Cedric, Fleur, and\\nKrum were beside the judges’ table, watching Harry\\nsprint toward them.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n‘Tm ... here ...” Harry panted, skidding to a halt in\\nthe mud and accidentally splattering Fleur’s robes.\\n“Where have you been?” said a bossy, disapproving\\nvoice. “The task’s about to start!”\\nHarry looked around. Percy Weasley was sitting at the\\njudges’ table — Mr. Crouch had failed to turn up\\nagain.\\n“Now, now, Percy!” said Ludo Bagman, who was\\nlooking intensely relieved to see Harry. “Let him catch\\nhis breath!”\\nDumbledore smiled at Harry, but Karkaroff and\\nMadame Maxime didn’t look at all pleased to see him.\\n... It was obvious from the looks on their faces that\\nthey had thought he wasn’t going to turn up.\\nHarry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for\\nbreath; he had a stitch in his side that felt as though\\nhe had a knife between his ribs, but there was no\\ntime to get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving\\namong the champions, spacing them along the bank\\nat intervals of ten feet. Harry was on the very end of\\nthe line, next to Krum, who was wearing swimming\\ntrunks and was holding his wand ready.\\n“All right, Harry?” Bagman whispered as he moved\\nHarry a few feet farther away from Krum. “Know what\\nyou’re going to do?”\\n“Yeah,” Harry panted, massaging his ribs.\\nBagman gave Harry’s shoulder a quick squeeze and\\nreturned to the judges’ table; he pointed his wand at\\nhis throat as he had done at the World Cup, said,\\n“Sonorusl” and his voice boomed out across the dark\\nwater toward the stands.\\n \\n“Well, all our champions are ready for the second\\ntask, which will start on my whistle. They have\\nprecisely an hour to recover what has been taken\\nfrom them. On the count of three, then. One ... two ...\\nthree!”\\nThe whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the\\nstands erupted with cheers and applause; without\\nlooking to see what the other champions were doing,\\nHarry pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the\\nhandful of gillyweed out of his pocket, stuffed it into\\nhis mouth, and waded out into the lake.\\nIt was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as\\nthough this were fire, not icy water. His sodden robes\\nweighed him down as he walked in deeper; now the\\nwater was over his knees, and his rapidly numbing\\nfeet were slipping over silt and flat, slimy stones. He\\nwas chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he\\ncould; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like\\noctopus tentacles. Waist-deep in the freezing water he\\nstopped, swallowed, and waited for something to\\nhappen.\\nHe could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he\\nmust look stupid, walking into the lake without\\nshowing any sign of magical power. The part of him\\nthat was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half\\nimmersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze lifting his\\nhair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided\\nlooking at the stands; the laughter was becoming\\nlouder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the\\nSlytherins. ...\\nThen, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an\\ninvisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and\\nnose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head\\nspin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a\\npiercing pain on either side of his neck —\\n \\nHarry clapped his hands around his throat and felt\\ntwo large slits just below his ears, flapping in the cold\\nair. ... He had gills. Without pausing to think, he did\\nthe only thing that made sense — he flung himself\\nforward into the water.\\nThe first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of\\nlife. His head had stopped spinning; he took another\\ngreat gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through\\nhis gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He\\nstretched out his hands in front of him and stared at\\nthem. They looked green and ghostly under the water,\\nand they had become webbed. He twisted around and\\nlooked at his bare feet — they had become elongated\\nand the toes were webbed too: It looked as though he\\nhad sprouted flippers.\\nThe water didn’t feel icy anymore either ... on the\\ncontrary, he felt pleasantly cool and very light. ...\\nHarry struck out once more, marveling at how far and\\nfast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the\\nwater, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how\\nhe no longer seemed to need to blink. He had soon\\nswum so far into the lake that he could no longer see\\nthe bottom. He flipped over and dived into its depths.\\nSilence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a\\nstrange, dark, foggy landscape. He could only see ten\\nfeet around him, so that as he sped through the water\\nnew scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the\\noncoming darkness: forests of rippling, tangled black\\nweed, wide plains of mud littered with dull,\\nglimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out\\ntoward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring\\nthrough the eerily gray-lit water around him to the\\nshadows beyond, where the water became opaque.\\nSmall fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or\\ntwice he thought he saw something larger moving\\n \\nahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered\\nit to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense\\nclump of weed. There was no sign of any of the other\\nchampions, merpeople, Ron — nor, thankfully, the\\ngiant squid.\\nLight green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he\\ncould see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very\\novergrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly\\nahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the\\ngloom . . . and then, without warning, something\\ngrabbed hold of his ankle.\\nHarry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a\\nsmall, horned water demon, poking out of the weed,\\nits long fingers clutched tightly around Harry’s leg, its\\npointed fangs bared — Harry stuck his webbed hand\\nquickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand. By\\nthe time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had\\nrisen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry’s\\nrobes, and were attempting to drag him down.\\n“Relashio\\\\” Harry shouted, except that no sound came\\nout. ... A large bubble issued from his mouth, and his\\nwand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows,\\npelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling\\nwater, for where it struck them, angry red patches\\nappeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his ankle\\nout of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he\\ncould, occasionally sending more jets of hot water\\nover his shoulder at random; every now and then he\\nfelt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again,\\nand he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot\\nconnect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw\\nthe dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while\\nits fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back\\ninto the weed.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back\\ninside his robes, and looked around, listening again.\\nHe turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing\\nharder than ever against his eardrums. He knew he\\nmust be even deeper in the lake now, but nothing was\\nmoving but the rippling weed.\\n“How are you getting on?”\\nHarry thought he was having a heart attack. He\\nwhipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating\\nhazily in front of him, gazing at him through her\\nthick, pearly glasses.\\n“Myrtle!” Harry tried to shout — but once again,\\nnothing came out of his mouth but a very large\\nbubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled.\\n“You want to try over there!” she said, pointing. “I\\nwon’t come with you. ... I don’t like them much, they\\nalways chase me when I get too close. ...”\\nHarry gave her the thumbs-up to show his thanks\\nand set off once more, careful to swim a bit higher\\nover the weed to avoid any more grindylows that\\nmight be lurking there.\\nHe swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes.\\nHe was passing over vast expanses of black mud now,\\nwhich swirled murkily as he disturbed the water.\\nThen, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting\\nmersong.\\n“An hour long you’ll have to look,\\nAnd to recover what we took ...”\\nHarry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge\\nout of the muddy water ahead. It had paintings of\\n \\nmerpeople on it; they were carrying spears and\\nchasing what looked like the giant squid. Harry swam\\non past the rock, following the mersong.\\n\"... your time’s half gone, so tarry not\\nLest what you seek stays here to rot. ...”\\nA cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae\\nloomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides. Here\\nand there at the dark windows, Harry saw faces ...\\nfaces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting\\nof the mermaid in the prefects’ bathroom. ...\\nThe merpeople had grayish skin and long, wild, dark\\ngreen hair. Their eyes were yellow, as were their\\nbroken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles\\naround their necks. They leered at Harry as he swam\\npast; one or two of them emerged from their caves to\\nwatch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails\\nbeating the water, spears clutched in their hands.\\nHarry sped on, staring around, and soon the\\ndwellings became more numerous; there were\\ngardens of weed around some of them, and he even\\nsaw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door.\\nMerpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching\\nhim eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills,\\ntalking behind their hands to one another. Harry sped\\naround a corner and a very strange sight met his\\neyes.\\nA whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of\\nthe houses that lined what looked like a mer-version\\nof a village square. A choir of merpeople was singing\\nin the middle, calling the champions toward them,\\nand behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a\\ngigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people\\nwere bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.\\n \\nRon was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang.\\nThere was also a girl who looked no older than eight,\\nwhose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that\\nshe was Fleur Delacour’s sister. All four of them\\nappeared to be in a very deep sleep. Their heads were\\nlolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of\\nbubbles kept issuing from their mouths.\\nHarry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the\\nmerpeople to lower their spears and charge at him,\\nbut they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the\\nhostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very\\nstrong. For a fleeting second he thought of the knife\\nSirius had bought him for Christmas — locked in his\\ntrunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to\\nhim whatsoever.\\nHe looked around. Many of the merpeople\\nsurrounding them were carrying spears. He swam\\nswiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long\\ngreen beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to\\nmime a request to borrow the spear. The merman\\nlaughed and shook his head.\\n“We do not help,” he said in a harsh, croaky voice.\\n“Come ON\\\\” Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles\\nissued from his mouth), and he tried to pull the spear\\naway from the merman, but the merman yanked it\\nback, still shaking his head and laughing.\\nHarry swirled around, staring about. Something\\nsharp ... anything ...\\nThere were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived\\nand snatched up a particularly jagged one and\\nreturned to the statue. He began to hack at the ropes\\nbinding Ron, and after several minutes’ hard work,\\nthey broke apart. Ron floated, unconscious, a few\\n \\ninches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the\\nebb of the water.\\nHarry looked around. There was no sign of any of the\\nother champions. What were they playing at? Why\\ndidn’t they hurry up? He turned back to Hermione,\\nraised the jagged rock, and began to hack at her\\nbindings too —\\nAt once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized\\nhim. Half a dozen mermen were pulling him away\\nfrom Hermione, shaking their green-haired heads,\\nand laughing.\\n“You take your own hostage,” one of them said to\\nhim. “Leave the others ...”\\n“No way!” said Harry furiously — but only two large\\nbubbles came out.\\n“Your task is to retrieve your own friend . . . leave the\\nothers ...”\\n“She’s my friend too!” Harry yelled, gesturing toward\\nHermione, an enormous silver bubble emerging\\nsoundlessly from his lips. “And I don’t want them to\\ndie either!”\\nCho’s head was on Hermione ’s shoulder; the small\\nsilver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale. Harry\\nstruggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed\\nharder than ever, holding him back. Harry looked\\nwildly around. Where were the other champions?\\nWould he have time to take Ron to the surface and\\ncome back down for Hermione and the others? Would\\nhe be able to find them again? He looked down at his\\nwatch to see how much time was left — it had\\nstopped working.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nBut then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly\\nover his head. Harry looked up and saw Cedric\\nswimming toward them. There was an enormous\\nbubble around his head, which made his features\\nlook oddly wide and stretched.\\n“Got lost!” he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. “Fleur\\nand Krum’re coming now!”\\nFeeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric\\npull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free. He\\npulled her upward and out of sight.\\nHarry looked around, waiting. Where were Fleur and\\nKrum? Time was getting short, and according to the\\nsong, the hostages would be lost after an hour. . . .\\nThe merpeople started screeching animatedly. Those\\nholding Harry loosened their grip, staring behind\\nthem. Harry turned and saw something monstrous\\ncutting through the water toward them: a human\\nbody in swimming trunks with the head of a shark. . . .\\nIt was Krum. He appeared to have transfigured\\nhimself — but badly.\\nThe shark-man swam straight to Hermione and began\\nsnapping and biting at her ropes; the trouble was that\\nKrum’s new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for\\nbiting anything smaller than a dolphin, and Harry\\nwas quite sure that if Krum wasn’t careful, he was\\ngoing to rip Hermione in half. Darting forward, Harry\\nhit Krum hard on the shoulder and held up the\\njagged stone. Krum seized it and began to cut\\nHermione free. Within seconds, he had done it; he\\ngrabbed Hermione around the waist, and without a\\nbackward glance, began to rise rapidly with her\\ntoward the surface.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nNow what? Harry thought desperately. If he could be\\nsure that Fleur was coming. ... But still no sign.\\nThere was nothing to be done except . . .\\nHe snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped,\\nbut the mermen now closed in around Ron and the\\nlittle girl, shaking their heads at him. Harry pulled\\nout his wand.\\n“Get out of the way!”\\nOnly bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the\\ndistinct impression that the mermen had understood\\nhim, because they suddenly stopped laughing. Their\\nyellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry’s wand, and\\nthey looked scared. There might be a lot more of them\\nthan there were of him, but Harry could tell, by the\\nlooks on their faces, that they knew no more magic\\nthan the giant squid did.\\n“You’ve got until three!” Harry shouted; a great\\nstream of bubbles burst from him, but he held up\\nthree fingers to make sure they got the message. “One\\n...” (he put down a finger) “two ...” (he put down a\\nsecond one) —\\nThey scattered. Harry darted forward and began to\\nhack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue,\\nand at last she was free. He seized the little girl\\naround the waist, grabbed the neck of Ron’s robes,\\nand kicked off from the bottom.\\nIt was very slow work. He could no longer use his\\nwebbed hands to propel himself forward; he worked\\nhis flippers furiously, but Ron and Fleur’s sister were\\nlike potato-filled sacks dragging him back down. ...\\nHe fixed his eyes skyward, though he knew he must\\nstill be very deep, the water above him was so dark.\\n \\nMerpeople were rising with him. He could see them\\nswirling around him with ease, watching him struggle\\nthrough the water. ... Would they pull him back down\\nto the depths when the time was up? Did they\\nperhaps eat humans? Harry’s legs were seizing up\\nwith the effort to keep swimming; his shoulders were\\naching horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and\\nthe girl. ...\\nHe was drawing breath with extreme difficulty. He\\ncould feel pain on the sides of his neck again ... he\\nwas becoming very aware of how wet the water was in\\nhis mouth . . . yet the darkness was definitely thinning\\nnow ... he could see daylight above him. ...\\nHe kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that\\nthey were nothing more than feet . . . water was\\nflooding through his mouth into his lungs ... he was\\nstarting to feel dizzy, but he knew light and air were\\nonly ten feet above him ... he had to get there ... he\\nhad to . . .\\nHarry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as\\nthough his muscles were screaming in protest; his\\nvery brain felt waterlogged, he couldn’t breathe, he\\nneeded oxygen, he had to keep going, he could not\\nstop —\\nAnd then he felt his head break the surface of the\\nlake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making his wet\\nface sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he\\nhad never breathed properly before, and, panting,\\npulled Ron and the little girl up with him. All around\\nhim, wild, green-haired heads were emerging out of\\nthe water with him, but they were smiling at him.\\nThe crowd in the stands was making a great deal of\\nnoise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be\\non their feet; Harry had the impression they thought\\n \\nthat Ron and the little girl might be dead, but they\\nwere wrong ... both of them had opened their eyes;\\nthe girl looked scared and confused, but Ron merely\\nexpelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright\\nlight, turned to Harry, and said, “Wet, this, isn’t it?”\\nThen he spotted Fleur’s sister. “What did you bring\\nher for?”\\n“Fleur didn’t turn up, I couldn’t leave her,” Harry\\npanted.\\n“Harry, you prat,” said Ron, “you didn’t take that song\\nthing seriously, did you? Dumbledore wouldn’t have\\nlet any of us drown!”\\n“The song said — ”\\n“It was only to make sure you got back inside the time\\nlimit!” said Ron. “I hope you didn’t waste time down\\nthere acting the hero!”\\nHarry felt both stupid and annoyed. It was all very\\nwell for Ron; he’d been asleep, he hadn’t felt how\\neerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear-\\ncarrying merpeople who’d looked more than capable\\nof murder.\\n“C’mon,” Harry said shortly, “help me with her, I don’t\\nthink she can swim very well.”\\nThey pulled Fleur’s sister through the water, back\\ntoward the bank where the judges stood watching,\\ntwenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of\\nhonor, singing their horrible screechy songs.\\nHarry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over\\nHermione, Krum, Cedric, and Cho, all of whom were\\nwrapped in thick blankets. Dumbledore and Ludo\\nBagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the\\n \\nbank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked\\nvery white and somehow much younger than usual,\\ncame splashing out to meet them. Meanwhile\\nMadame Maxime was trying to restrain Fleur\\nDelacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and\\nnail to return to the water.\\n“Gabrielle! Gabrielle\\\\ Is she alive ? Is she ’urt?”\\n“She’s fine!” Harry tried to tell her, but he was so\\nexhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout.\\nPercy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the\\nbank (“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); Dumbledore and\\nBagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken\\nfree of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.\\n“It was ze grindylows . . . zey attacked me ... oh\\nGabrielle, I thought ... I thought ...”\\n“Come here, you,” said Madam Pomfrey. She seized\\nHarry and pulled him over to Hermione and the\\nothers, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he\\nfelt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a\\nmeasure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam\\ngushed out of his ears.\\n“Harry, well done!” Hermione cried. “You did it, you\\nfound out how all by yourself!”\\n“Well — ” said Harry. He would have told her about\\nDobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching\\nhim. He was the only judge who had not left the table;\\nthe only judge not showing signs of pleasure and\\nrelief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur’s sister had got back\\nsafely. “Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, raising his\\nvoice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-\\nninny,” said Krum. Harry had the impression that\\nKrum was drawing her attention back onto himself;\\nperhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her\\nfrom the lake, but Hermione brushed away the beetle\\nimpatiently and said, “You’re well outside the time\\nlimit, though, Harry. . . . Did it take you ages to find\\nus?”\\n“No ... I found you okay. ...”\\nHarry’s feeling of stupidity was growing. Now he was\\nout of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that\\nDumbledore’s safety precautions wouldn’t have\\npermitted the death of a hostage just because their\\nchampion hadn’t turned up. Why hadn’t he just\\ngrabbed Ron and gone? He would have been first\\nback. ... Cedric and Krum hadn’t wasted time\\nworrying about anyone else; they hadn’t taken the\\nmersong seriously. ...\\nDumbledore was crouching at the water’s edge, deep\\nin conversation with what seemed to be the chief\\nmerperson, a particularly wild and ferocious-looking\\nfemale. He was making the same sort of screechy\\nnoises that the merpeople made when they were\\nabove water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak\\nMermish. Finally he straightened up, turned to his\\nfellow judges, and said, “A conference before we give\\nthe marks, I think.”\\nThe judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had\\ngone to rescue Ron from Percy’s clutches; she led him\\nover to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and\\nsome Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and\\nher sister. Fleur had many cuts on her face and arms\\nand her robes were torn, but she didn’t seem to care,\\nnor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Look after Gabrielle,” she told her, and then she\\nturned to Harry. “You saved ’er,” she said\\nbreathlessly. “Even though she was not your ’ostage.”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, who was now heartily wishing\\nhe’d left all three girls tied to the statue.\\nFleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek\\n(he felt his face burn and wouldn’t have been\\nsurprised if steam was coming out of his ears again),\\nthen said to Ron, “And you too — you ’elped — ”\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, “yeah, a\\nbit — ”\\nFleur swooped down on him too and kissed him.\\nHermione looked simply furious, but just then, Ludo\\nBagman’s magically magnified voice boomed out\\nbeside them, making them all jump, and causing the\\ncrowd in the stands to go very quiet.\\n“Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision.\\nMerchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what\\nhappened at the bottom of the lake, and we have\\ntherefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each\\nof the champions, as follows. ...\\n“Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent\\nuse of the Bubble-Head Charm, was attacked by\\ngrindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to\\nretrieve her hostage. We award her twenty-five\\npoints.”\\nApplause from the stands.\\n“I deserved zero,” said Fleur throatily, shaking her\\nmagnificent head.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head\\nCharm, was first to return with his hostage, though\\nhe returned one minute outside the time limit of an\\nhour.” Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the\\ncrowd; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look. “We\\ntherefore award him forty-seven points.”\\nHarry’s heart sank. If Cedric had been outside the\\ntime limit, he most certainly had been.\\n“Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of\\nTransfiguration, which was nevertheless effective, and\\nwas second to return with his hostage. We award him\\nforty points.”\\nKarkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very\\nsuperior.\\n“Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect,” Bagman\\ncontinued. “He returned last, and well outside the\\ntime limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess\\ninforms us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the\\nhostages, and that the delay in his return was due to\\nhis determination to return all hostages to safety, not\\nmerely his own.”\\nRon and Hermione both gave Harry half-exasperated,\\nhalf-commiserating looks.\\n“Most of the judges,” and here, Bagman gave\\nKarkaroff a very nasty look, “feel that this shows\\nmoral fiber and merits full marks. However ... Mr.\\nPotter’s score is forty-five points.”\\nHarry’s stomach leapt — he was now tying for first\\nplace with Cedric. Ron and Hermione, caught by\\nsurprise, stared at Harry, then laughed and started\\napplauding hard with the rest of the crowd.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“There you go, Harry!” Ron shouted over the noise.\\n“You weren’t being thick after all — you were showing\\nmoral fiber!”\\nFleur was clapping very hard too, but Krum didn’t\\nlook happy at all. He attempted to engage Hermione\\nin conversation again, but she was too busy cheering\\nHarry to listen.\\n“The third and final task will take place at dusk on\\nthe twenty-fourth of June,” continued Bagman. “The\\nchampions will be notified of what is coming precisely\\none month beforehand. Thank you all for your\\nsupport of the champions.”\\nIt was over, Harry thought dazedly, as Madam\\nPomfrey began herding the champions and hostages\\nback to the castle to get into dry clothes ... it was\\nover, he had got through ... he didn’t have to worry\\nabout anything now until June the twenty-fourth. ...\\nNext time he was in Hogsmeade, Harry decided as he\\nwalked back up the stone steps into the castle, he\\nwas going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day\\nof the year.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nPADFOOT RETURNS\\nOne of the best things about the aftermath of the\\nsecond task was that everybody was very keen to hear\\ndetails of what had happened down in the lake, which\\nmeant that Ron was getting to share Harry’s limelight\\nfor once. Harry noticed that Ron’s version of events\\nchanged subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave\\nwhat seemed to be the truth; it tallied with\\nHermione’s story, anyway — Dumbledore had put all\\nthe hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor\\nMcGonagall’s office, first assuring them that they\\nwould be quite safe, and would awake when they were\\nback above the water. One week later, however, Ron\\nwas telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he\\nstruggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed\\nmerpeople who had to beat him into submission\\nbefore tying him up.\\n“But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,” he assured\\nPadma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron\\nnow that he was getting so much attention and was\\nmaking a point of talking to him every time they\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\npassed in the corridors. “I could’ve taken those mer-\\nidiots any time I wanted.”\\n“What were you going to do, snore at them?” said\\nHermione waspishly. People had been teasing her so\\nmuch about being the thing that Viktor Krum would\\nmost miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.\\nRon’s ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the\\nbewitched sleep version of events.\\nAs they entered March the weather became drier, but\\ncruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time\\nthey went out onto the grounds. There were delays in\\nthe post because the owls kept being blown off\\ncourse. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius\\nwith the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up\\nat breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers\\nsticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn\\noff Sirius’s reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it\\nwas going to be sent outside again.\\nSirius’s letter was almost as short as the previous\\none.\\nBe at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past\\nDervish and Banges) at two o’clock on Saturday\\nafternoon. Bring as much food as you can.\\n“He hasn’t come back to Hogsmeade?” said Ron\\nincredulously.\\n“It looks like it, doesn’t it?” said Hermione.\\n“I can’t believe him,” said Harry tensely, “if he’s\\ncaught ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Made it so far, though, hasn’t he?” said Ron. “And\\nit’s not like the place is swarming with dementors\\nanymore.”\\nHarry folded up the letter, thinking. If he was honest\\nwith himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He\\ntherefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon\\n— double Potions — feeling considerably more\\ncheerful than he usually did when descending the\\nsteps to the dungeons.\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle\\noutside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson’s\\ngang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at\\nsomething Harry couldn’t see and sniggering heartily.\\nPansy’s pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle ’s\\nbroad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.\\n“There they are, there they are!” she giggled, and the\\nknot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy\\nhad a magazine in her hands — Witch Weekly. The\\nmoving picture on the front showed a curly-haired\\nwitch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large\\nsponge cake with her wand.\\n“You might find something to interest you in there,\\nGranger!” Pansy said loudly, and she threw the\\nmagazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking\\nstartled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened,\\nand Snape beckoned them all inside.\\nHermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the\\nback of the dungeon as usual. Once Snape had\\nturned his back on them to write up the ingredients\\nof today’s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily\\nrifled through the magazine under the desk. At last,\\nin the center pages, Hermione found what they were\\nlooking for. Harry and Ron leaned in closer. A color\\nphotograph of Harry headed a short piece entitled:\\n \\nHarry Potter’s Secret Heartache\\nA boy like no other, perhaps — yet a boy suffering all\\nthe usual pangs of adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter.\\nDeprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents,\\nfourteen-year-old Harry Potter thought he had found\\nsolace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle-\\nborn Hermione Granger. Little did he know that he\\nwould shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow\\nin a life already littered with personal loss.\\nMiss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to\\nhave a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone\\ncannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor\\nKrum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World\\nQuidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with\\nboth boys’ affections. Krum, who is openly smitten\\nwith the devious Miss Granger, has already invited\\nher to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays,\\nand insists that he has “never felt this way about any\\nother girl.”\\nHowever, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful\\nnatural charms that have captured these unfortunate\\nboys’ interest.\\n“She’s really ugly,” says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty\\nand vivacious fourth-year student, “but she’d be well\\nup to making a Love Potion, she’s quite brainy. I\\nthink that’s how she’s doing it.”\\nLove Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and\\nno doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate\\nthese claims. In the meantime, Harry Potter’s well-\\nwishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his\\nheart on a worthier candidate.\\n“I told you!” Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared\\ndown at the article. “I told you not to annoy Rita\\n \\nSkeeter! She’s made you out to be some sort of — of\\nscarlet woman!”\\nHermione stopped looking astonished and snorted\\nwith laughter. “ Scarlet woman?” she repeated,\\nshaking with suppressed giggles as she looked\\naround at Ron.\\n“It’s what my mum calls them,” Ron muttered, his\\nears going red.\\n“If that’s the best Rita can do, she’s losing her touch,”\\nsaid Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch\\nWeekly onto the empty chair beside her. “What a pile\\nof old rubbish.”\\nShe looked over at the Slytherins, who were all\\nwatching her and Harry closely across the room to see\\nif they had been upset by the article. Hermione gave\\nthem a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry,\\nand Ron started unpacking the ingredients they\\nwould need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion.\\n“There’s something funny, though,” said Hermione\\nten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over\\na bowl of scarab beetles. “How could Rita Skeeter\\nhave known ... ?”\\n“Known what?” said Ron quickly. “You haven’t been\\nmixing up Love Potions, have you?”\\n“Don’t be stupid,” Hermione snapped, starting to\\npound up her beetles again. “No, it’s just ... how did\\nshe know Viktor asked me to visit him over the\\nsummer?”\\nHermione blushed scarlet as she said this and\\ndeterminedly avoided Ron’s eyes.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“What?” said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud\\nclunk.\\n“He asked me right after he’d pulled me out of the\\nlake,” Hermione muttered. “After he’d got rid of his\\nshark’s head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets\\nand then he sort of pulled me away from the judges\\nso they wouldn’t hear, and he said, if I wasn’t doing\\nanything over the summer, would I like to — ”\\n“And what did you say?” said Ron, who had picked up\\nhis pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six\\ninches from his bowl, because he was looking at\\nHermione.\\n“And he did say he’d never felt the same way about\\nanyone else,” Hermione went on, going so red now\\nthat Harry could almost feel the heat coming from\\nher, “but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him?\\nShe wasn’t there ... or was she? Maybe she has got an\\nInvisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the\\ngrounds to watch the second task. ...”\\n“And what did you say?” Ron repeated, pounding his\\npestle down so hard that it dented the desk.\\n“Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry\\nwere okay to — ”\\n“Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is,\\nMiss Granger,” said an icy voice right behind them,\\nand all three of them jumped, “I must ask you not to\\ndiscuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor.”\\nSnape had glided over to their desk while they were\\ntalking. The whole class was now looking around at\\nthem; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER\\nSTINKS across the dungeon at Harry.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?”\\nSnape added, snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly.\\n“A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of\\ncourse ...” Snape’s black eyes glittered as they fell on\\nRita Skeeter’s article. “Potter has to keep up with his\\npress cuttings. ...”\\nThe dungeon rang with the Slytherins’ laughter, and\\nan unpleasant smile curled Snape’s thin mouth. To\\nHarry’s fury, he began to read the article aloud.\\n“ ‘Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache . . . dear, dear,\\nPotter, what’s ailing you now? ‘A boy like no other,\\nperhaps ...’ ”\\nHarry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing\\nat the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a\\nhearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse\\nwhen read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing\\nscarlet now.\\n“ ‘. . . Harry Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next\\ntime, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.’\\nHow very touching,” sneered Snape, rolling up the\\nmagazine to continued gales of laughter from the\\nSlytherins. “Well, I think I had better separate the\\nthree of you, so you can keep your minds on your\\npotions rather than on your tangled love lives.\\nWeasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there,\\nbeside Miss Parkinson. Potter — that table in front of\\nmy desk. Move. Now.”\\nFurious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into\\nhis cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the\\ndungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down\\nat his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron.\\nDetermined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the\\nmashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to\\nhave Snape’s face.\\n \\n“All this press attention seems to have inflated your\\nalready over-large head, Potter,” said Snape quietly,\\nonce the rest of the class had settled down again.\\nHarry didn’t answer. He knew Snape was trying to\\nprovoke him; he had done this before. No doubt he\\nwas hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points\\nfrom Gryffindor before the end of the class.\\n“You might be laboring under the delusion that the\\nentire wizarding world is impressed with you,” Snape\\nwent on, so quietly that no one else could hear him\\n(Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even\\nthough he had already reduced them to a very fine\\npowder), “but I don’t care how many times your\\npicture appears in the papers. To me, Potter, you are\\nnothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to\\nbe beneath him.”\\nHarry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron\\nand started cutting up his ginger roots. His hands\\nwere shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his\\neyes down, as though he couldn’t hear what Snape\\nwas saying to him.\\n“So I give you fair warning, Potter,” Snape continued\\nin a softer and more dangerous voice, “pint-sized\\ncelebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my\\noffice one more time — ”\\n“I haven’t been anywhere near your office!” said Harry\\nangrily, forgetting his feigned deafness.\\n“Don’t lie to me,” Snape hissed, his fathomless black\\neyes boring into Harry’s. “Boomslang skin. Gillyweed.\\nBoth come from my private stores, and I know who\\nstole them.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink\\nor to look guilty. In truth, he hadn’t stolen either of\\nthese things from Snape. Hermione had taken the\\nboomslang skin back in their second year — they had\\nneeded it for the Polyjuice Potion — and while Snape\\nhad suspected Harry at the time, he had never been\\nable to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the\\ngillyweed.\\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry lied\\ncoldly.\\n“You were out of bed on the night my office was\\nbroken into!” Snape hissed. “I know it, Potter! Now,\\nMad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but\\nI will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime\\nstroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay!”\\n“Right,” said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger\\nroots. “I’ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go\\nin there.”\\nSnape’s eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the\\ninside of his black robes. For one wild moment, Harry\\nthought Snape was about to pull out his wand and\\ncurse him — then he saw that Snape had drawn out a\\nsmall crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry\\nstared at it.\\n“Do you know what this is, Potter?” Snape said, his\\neyes glittering dangerously again.\\n“No,” said Harry, with complete honesty this time.\\n“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that\\nthree drops would have you spilling your innermost\\nsecrets for this entire class to hear,” said Snape\\nviciously. “Now, the use of this potion is controlled by\\nvery strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch\\n \\nyour step, you might just find that my hand slips” —\\nhe shook the crystal bottle slightly — “right over your\\nevening pumpkin juice. And then, Potter ... then we’ll\\nfind out whether you’ve been in my office or not.”\\nHarry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger\\nroots once more, picked up his knife, and started\\nslicing them again. He didn’t like the sound of that\\nTruth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to\\nslip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought\\nof what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape\\ndid it . . . quite apart from landing a whole lot of people\\nin trouble — Hermione and Dobby for a start — there\\nwere all the other things he was concealing . . . like the\\nfact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . and — his\\ninsides squirmed at the thought — how he felt about\\nCho. ... He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron\\ntoo, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out\\nof Moody’s book and start drinking only from a\\nprivate hip flask.\\nThere was a knock on the dungeon door.\\n“Enter,” said Snape in his usual voice.\\nThe class looked around as the door opened.\\nProfessor Karkaroff came in. Everyone watched him\\nas he walked up toward Snape ’s desk. He was\\ntwisting his finger around his goatee and looking\\nagitated.\\n“We need to talk,” said Karkaroff abruptly when he\\nhad reached Snape. He seemed so determined that\\nnobody should hear what he was saying that he was\\nbarely opening his lips; it was as though he were a\\nrather poor ventriloquist. Harry kept his eyes on his\\nginger roots, listening hard.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I’ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,” Snape\\nmuttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him.\\n“I want to talk now, while you can’t slip off, Severus.\\nYou’ve been avoiding me.”\\n“After the lesson,” Snape snapped.\\nUnder the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to\\nsee if he’d poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry\\nsneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them.\\nKarkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked\\nangry.\\nKarkaroff hovered behind Snape ’s desk for the rest of\\nthe double period. He seemed intent on preventing\\nSnape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen to\\nhear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately\\nknocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two\\nminutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse\\nto duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while\\nthe rest of the class moved noisily toward the door.\\n“What’s so urgent?” he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff.\\n“This,” said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the\\nedge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left-\\nhand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on\\nhis inner forearm.\\n“Well?” said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to\\nmove his lips. “Do you see? It’s never been this clear,\\nnever since — ”\\n“Put it away!” snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping\\nthe classroom.\\n“But you must have noticed — ” Karkaroff began in an\\nagitated voice.\\n \\n“We can talk later, Karkaroff!” spat Snape. “Potter!\\nWhat are you doing?”\\n“Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,” said Harry\\ninnocently, straightening up and showing Snape the\\nsodden rag he was holding.\\nKarkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the\\ndungeon. He looked both worried and angry. Not\\nwanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry\\nSnape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back\\ninto his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and\\nHermione what he had just witnessed.\\nThey left the castle at noon the next day to find a\\nweak silver sun shining down upon the grounds. The\\nweather was milder than it had been all year, and by\\nthe time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them\\nhad taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their\\nshoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was\\nin Harry’s bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken\\nlegs, a loaf of bread, and a flask of pumpkin juice\\nfrom the lunch table.\\nThey went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present\\nfor Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most\\nlurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned\\nwith flashing gold and silver stars, and another that\\nscreamed loudly when they became too smelly. Then,\\nat half past one, they made their way up the High\\nStreet, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the\\nedge of the village.\\nHarry had never been in this direction before. The\\nwinding lane was leading them out into the wild\\ncountryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were\\nfewer here, and their gardens larger; they were\\nwalking toward the foot of the mountain in whose\\nshadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner\\n \\nand saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for\\nthem, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very\\nlarge, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some\\nnewspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . .\\n“Hello, Sirius,” said Harry when they had reached\\nhim.\\nThe black dog sniffed Harry’s bag eagerly, wagged its\\ntail once, then turned and began to trot away from\\nthem across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to\\nmeet the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione climbed over the stile and followed.\\nSirius led them to the very foot of the mountain,\\nwhere the ground was covered with boulders and\\nrocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath.\\nThey followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain\\nitself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep,\\nwinding, and stony path, following Sirius’s wagging\\ntail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of\\nHarry’s bag cutting into his shoulders.\\nThen, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when\\nthey reached the place where he had vanished, they\\nsaw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into\\nit and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave.\\nTethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a\\nlarge rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray\\nhorse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak’s fierce orange eye\\nflashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed\\nlow to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a\\nmoment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and\\nallowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his\\nfeathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the\\nblack dog, which had just turned into his godfather.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nSirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones\\nhe had been wearing when he had left Azkaban. His\\nblack hair was longer than it had been when he had\\nappeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted\\nonce more. He looked very thin.\\n“Chicken!” he said hoarsely after removing the old\\nDaily Prophets from his mouth and throwing them\\ndown onto the cave floor.\\nHarry pulled open his bag and handed over the\\nbundle of chicken legs and bread.\\n“Thanks,” said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a\\ndrumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing\\noff a large chunk with his teeth. “I’ve been living off\\nrats mostly. Can’t steal too much food from\\nHogsmeade; I’d draw attention to myself.”\\nHe grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin\\nonly reluctantly.\\n“What’re you doing here, Sirius?” he said.\\n“Fulfilling my duty as godfather,” said Sirius, gnawing\\non the chicken bone in a very doglike way. “Don’t\\nworry about it, I’m pretending to be a lovable stray.”\\nHe was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in\\nHarry’s face, said more seriously, “I want to be on the\\nspot. Your last letter ... well, let’s just say things are\\ngetting fishier. I’ve been stealing the paper every time\\nsomeone throws one out, and by the looks of things,\\nI’m not the only one who’s getting worried.”\\nHe nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave\\nfloor, and Ron picked them up and unfolded them.\\nHarry, however, continued to stare at Sirius.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“What if they catch you? What if you’re seen?”\\n“You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around\\nhere who know I’m an Animagus,” said Sirius,\\nshrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg.\\nRon nudged Harry and passed him the Daily\\nProphets. There were two: The first bore the headline\\nMystery Illness of Bartemius Crouch, the second,\\nMinistry Witch Still Missing — Minister of Magic Now\\nPersonally Involved.\\nHarry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases\\njumped out at him: hasn’t been seen in public since\\nNovember ... house appears deserted ... St. Mungo’s\\nHospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline\\ncomment . . . Ministry refuses to confirm rumors of\\ncritical illness. . . .\\n“They’re making it sound like he’s dying,” said Harry\\nslowly. “But he can’t be that ill if he managed to get\\nup here. ...”\\n“My brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant,” Ron\\ninformed Sirius. “He says Crouch is suffering from\\noverwork.”\\n“Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up\\nclose,” said Harry slowly, still reading the story. “The\\nnight my name came out of the goblet. ...”\\n“Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn’t\\nhe?” said Hermione, an edge to her voice. She was\\nstroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius’s\\nchicken bones. “I bet he wishes he hadn’t done it now\\n— bet he feels the difference now she’s not there to\\nlook after him.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Hermione’s obsessed with house-elfs,” Ron muttered\\nto Sirius, casting Hermione a dark look. Sirius,\\nhowever, looked interested.\\n“Crouch sacked his house-elf?”\\n“Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,” said Harry, and\\nhe launched into the story of the Dark Mark’s\\nappearance, and Winky being found with Harry’s\\nwand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch’s fury.\\nWhen Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet again\\nand had started pacing up and down the cave.\\n“Let me get this straight,” he said after a while,\\nbrandishing a fresh chicken leg. “You first saw the elf\\nin the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?”\\n“Right,” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.\\n“But Crouch didn’t turn up for the match?”\\n“No,” said Harry. “I think he said he’d been too busy.”\\nSirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he\\nsaid, “Harry, did you check your pockets for your\\nwand after you’d left the Top Box?”\\n“Erm ...” Harry thought hard. “No,” he said finally. “I\\ndidn’t need to use it before we got in the forest. And\\nthen I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in\\nthere were my Omnioculars.” He stared at Sirius. “Are\\nyou saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand\\nin the Top Box?”\\n“It’s possible,” said Sirius.\\n“Winky didn’t steal that wand!” Hermione insisted.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“The elf wasn’t the only one in that box,” said Sirius,\\nhis brow furrowed as he continued to pace. “Who else\\nwas sitting behind you?”\\n“Loads of people,” said Harry. “Some Bulgarian\\nministers ... Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ...”\\n“The Malfoys!” said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his\\nvoice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak\\ntossed his head nervously. “I bet it was Lucius\\nMalfoy!”\\n“Anyone else?” said Sirius.\\n“No one,” said Harry.\\n“Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,” Hermione\\nreminded him.\\n“Oh yeah ...”\\n“I don’t know anything about Bagman except that he\\nused to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,” said\\nSirius, still pacing. “What’s he like?”\\n“He’s okay,” said Harry. “He keeps offering to help me\\nwith the Triwizard Tournament.”\\n“Does he, now?” said Sirius, frowning more deeply. “I\\nwonder why he’d do that?”\\n“Says he’s taken a liking to me,” said Harry.\\n“Hmm,” said Sirius, looking thoughtful.\\n“We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark\\nappeared,” Hermione told Sirius. “Remember?” she\\nsaid to Harry and Ron.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Yeah, but he didn’t stay in the forest, did he?” said\\nRon. “The moment we told him about the riot, he\\nwent off to the campsite.”\\n“How d’you know?” Hermione shot back. “How d’you\\nknow where he Disapparated to?”\\n“Come off it,” said Ron incredulously. “Are you saying\\nyou reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?”\\n“It’s more likely he did it than Winky,” said Hermione\\nstubbornly.\\n“Told you,” said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius,\\n“told you she’s obsessed with house — ”\\nBut Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron.\\n“When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf\\nhad been discovered holding Harry’s wand, what did\\nCrouch do?”\\n“Went to look in the bushes,” said Harry, “but there\\nwasn’t anyone else there.”\\n“Of course,” Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, “of\\ncourse, he’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf\\n. . . and then he sacked her?”\\n“Yes,” said Hermione in a heated voice, “he sacked\\nher, just because she hadn’t stayed in her tent and let\\nherself get trampled — ”\\n“Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!” said\\nRon.\\nSirius shook his head and said, “She’s got the\\nmeasure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nwant to know what a man’s like, take a good look at\\nhow he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”\\nHe ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently\\nthinking hard.\\n“All these absences of Barty Crouch’s ... he goes to\\nthe trouble of making sure his house-elf saves him a\\nseat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn’t bother\\nto turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate\\nthe Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to\\nthat too. ... It’s not like Crouch. If he’s ever taken a\\nday off work because of illness before this, I’ll eat\\nBuckbeak.”\\n“D’you know Crouch, then?” said Harry.\\nSirius’s face darkened. He suddenly looked as\\nmenacing as he had the night when Harry first met\\nhim, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a\\nmurderer.\\n“Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was\\nthe one who gave the order for me to be sent to\\nAzkaban — without a trial.”\\n“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.\\n“You’re kidding!” said Harry.\\n“No, I’m not,” said Sirius, taking another great bite of\\nchicken. “Crouch used to be Head of the Department\\nof Magical Law Enforcement, didn’t you know?”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads.\\n“He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,” said\\nSirius. “He’s a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully\\nmagical — and power-hungry. Oh never a Voldemort\\n \\nsupporter,” he said, reading the look on Harry’s face.\\n“No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against\\nthe Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were\\nagainst the Dark Side ... well, you wouldn’t\\nunderstand ... you’re too young. ...”\\n“That’s what my dad said at the World Cup,” said\\nRon, with a trace of irritation in his voice. “Try us,\\nwhy don’t you?”\\nA grin flashed across Sirius’s thin face.\\n“All right, I’ll try you. ...” He walked once up the cave,\\nback again, and then said, “Imagine that Voldemort’s\\npowerful now. You don’t know who his supporters\\nare, you don’t know who’s working for him and who\\nisn’t; you know he can control people so that they do\\nterrible things without being able to stop themselves.\\nYou’re scared for yourself, and your family, and your\\nfriends. Every week, news comes of more deaths,\\nmore disappearances, more torturing ... the Ministry\\nof Magic’s in disarray, they don’t know what to do,\\nthey’re trying to keep everything hidden from the\\nMuggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too.\\nTerror everywhere ... panic ... confusion ... that’s how\\nit used to be.\\n“Well, times like that bring out the best in some\\npeople and the worst in others. Crouch’s principles\\nmight’ve been good in the beginning — I wouldn’t\\nknow. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he\\nstarted ordering very harsh measures against\\nVoldemort’s supporters. The Aurors were given new\\npowers — powers to kill rather than capture, for\\ninstance. And I wasn’t the only one who was handed\\nstraight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought\\nviolence with violence, and authorized the use of the\\nUnforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he\\nbecame as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark\\n \\nSide. He had his supporters, mind you — plenty of\\npeople thought he was going about things the right\\nway, and there were a lot of witches and wizards\\nclamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic.\\nWhen Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a\\nmatter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then\\nsomething rather unfortunate happened. ...” Sirius\\nsmiled grimly. “Crouch’s own son was caught with a\\ngroup of Death Eaters who’d managed to talk their\\nway out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to\\nfind Voldemort and return him to power.”\\n“Crouch’s son was caught?” gasped Hermione.\\n“Yep,” said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to\\nBuckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground\\nbeside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. “Nasty\\nlittle shock for old Barty, I’d imagine. Should have\\nspent a bit more time at home with his family,\\nshouldn’t he? Ought to have left the office early once\\nin a while ... gotten to know his own son.”\\nHe began to wolf down large pieces of bread.\\n“ Was his son a Death Eater?” said Harry.\\n“No idea,” said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. “I was\\nin Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is\\nmostly stuff I’ve found out since I got out. The boy\\nwas definitely caught in the company of people I’d bet\\nmy life were Death Eaters — but he might have been\\nin the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the\\nhouse-elf.”\\n“Did Crouch try and get his son off?” Hermione\\nwhispered.\\nSirius let out a laugh that was much more like a\\nbark.\\n \\n“Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the\\nmeasure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened\\nto tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated\\nhis whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw\\nhim dismiss a devoted house-elf because she\\nassociated him with the Dark Mark again — doesn’t\\nthat tell you what he’s like? Crouch’s fatherly\\naffection stretched just far enough to give his son a\\ntrial, and by all accounts, it wasn’t much more than\\nan excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the\\nboy ... then he sent him straight to Azkaban.”\\n“He gave his own son to the dementors?” asked Harry\\nquietly.\\n“That’s right,” said Sirius, and he didn’t look remotely\\namused now. “I saw the dementors bringing him in,\\nwatched them through the bars in my cell door. He\\ncan’t have been more than nineteen. They took him\\ninto a cell near mine. He was screaming for his\\nmother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days,\\nthough . . . they all went quiet in the end . . . except\\nwhen they shrieked in their sleep. ...”\\nFor a moment, the deadened look in Sirius’s eyes\\nbecame more pronounced than ever, as though\\nshutters had closed behind them.\\n“So he’s still in Azkaban?” Harry said.\\n“No,” said Sirius dully. “No, he’s not in there anymore.\\nHe died about a year after they brought him in.”\\n“He died?”\\n“He wasn’t the only one,” said Sirius bitterly. “Most go\\nmad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They\\nlose the will to live. You could always tell when a\\ndeath was coming, because the dementors could\\n \\nsense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty\\nsickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important\\nMinistry member, he and his wife were allowed a\\ndeathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty\\nCrouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died\\nherself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted\\naway just like the boy. Crouch never came for his\\nson’s body. The dementors buried him outside the\\nfortress; I watched them do it.”\\nSirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his\\nmouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin\\njuice and drained it.\\n“So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he\\nhad it made,” he continued, wiping his mouth with\\nthe back of his hand. “One moment, a hero, poised to\\nbecome Minister of Magic . . . next, his son dead, his\\nwife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I’ve\\nheard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once\\nthe boy had died, people started feeling a bit more\\nsympathetic toward the son and started asking how a\\nnice young lad from a good family had gone so badly\\nastray. The conclusion was that his father never\\ncared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top\\njob, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the\\nDepartment of International Magical Cooperation.”\\nThere was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the\\nway Crouch’s eyes had bulged as he’d looked down at\\nhis disobedient house-elf back in the wood at the\\nQuidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been\\nwhy Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found\\nbeneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back\\nmemories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall\\nfrom grace at the Ministry.\\n“Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark\\nwizards,” Harry told Sirius.\\n \\n“Yeah, I’ve heard it’s become a bit of a mania with\\nhim,” said Sirius, nodding. “If you ask me, he still\\nthinks he can bring back the old popularity by\\ncatching one more Death Eater.”\\n“And he sneaked up here to search Snape’s office!”\\nsaid Ron triumphantly, looking at Hermione.\\n“Yes, and that doesn’t make sense at all,” said Sirius.\\n“Yeah, it does!” said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook\\nhis head.\\n“Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why\\nhasn’t he been coming to judge the tournament? It\\nwould be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to\\nHogwarts and keep an eye on him.”\\n“So you think Snape could be up to something, then?”\\nasked Harry, but Hermione broke in.\\n“Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts\\nSnape — ”\\n“Oh give it a rest, Hermione,” said Ron impatiently. “I\\nknow Dumbledore ’s brilliant and everything, but that\\ndoesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn’t fool\\nhim — ”\\n“Why did Snape save Harry’s life in the first year,\\nthen? Why didn’t he just let him die?”\\n“I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would\\nkick him out — ”\\n“What d’you think, Sirius?” Harry said loudly, and\\nRon and Hermione stopped bickering to listen.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I think they’ve both got a point,” said Sirius, looking\\nthoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. “Ever since I\\nfound out Snape was teaching here, I’ve wondered\\nwhy Dumbledore hired him. Snape ’s always been\\nfascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at\\nschool. Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was,” Sirius\\nadded, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other.\\n“Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school\\nthan half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of\\na gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be\\nDeath Eaters.”\\nSirius held up his fingers and began ticking off\\nnames.\\n“Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors\\nthe year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges —\\nthey’re a married couple — they’re in Azkaban. Avery\\n— from what I’ve heard he wormed his way out of\\ntrouble by saying he’d been acting under the Imperius\\nCurse — he’s still at large. But as far as I know,\\nSnape was never even accused of being a Death Eater\\n— not that that means much. Plenty of them were\\nnever caught. And Snape ’s certainly clever and\\ncunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.”\\n“Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to\\nkeep that quiet,” said Ron.\\n“Yeah, you should’ve seen Snape’s face when\\nKarkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!” said Harry\\nquickly. “Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says\\nSnape’s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really\\nworried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but\\nI couldn’t see what it was.”\\n“He showed Snape something on his arm?” said\\nSirius, looking frankly bewildered. He ran his fingers\\ndistractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged\\n \\nagain. “Well, I’ve no idea what that’s about ... but if\\nKarkaroff’s genuinely worried, and he’s going to\\nSnape for answers ...”\\nSirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of\\nfrustration.\\n“There’s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape,\\nand I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other\\npeople wouldn’t, but I just can’t see him letting Snape\\nteach at Hogwarts if he’d ever worked for Voldemort.”\\n“Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into\\nSnape ’s office then?” said Ron stubbornly.\\n“Well,” said Sirius slowly, “I wouldn’t put it past Mad-\\nEye to have searched every single teacher’s office\\nwhen he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I’m not sure\\nhe trusts anyone at all, and after the things he’s seen,\\nit’s not surprising. I’ll say this for Moody, though, he\\nnever killed if he could help it. Always brought people\\nin alive where possible. He was tough, but he never\\ndescended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch,\\nthough ... he’s a different matter ... is he really ill? If\\nhe is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to\\nSnape ’s office? And if he’s not ... what’s he up to?\\nWhat was he doing at the World Cup that was so\\nimportant he didn’t turn up in the Top Box? What’s\\nhe been doing while he should have been judging the\\ntournament?”\\nSirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave\\nwall. Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky\\nfloor, looking for bones he might have overlooked.\\nFinally, Sirius looked up at Ron.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You say your brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant?\\nAny chance you could ask him if he’s seen Crouch\\nlately?”\\n“I can try,” said Ron doubtfully. “Better not make it\\nsound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy,\\nthough. Percy loves Crouch.”\\n“And you might try and find out whether they’ve got\\nany leads on Bertha Jorkins while you’re at it,” said\\nSirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily\\nProphet.\\n“Bagman told me they hadn’t,” said Harry.\\n“Yes, he’s quoted in the article in there,” said Sirius,\\nnodding at the paper. “Blustering on about how bad\\nBertha’s memory is. Well, maybe she’s changed since\\nI knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn’t forgetful at\\nall — quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she\\nhad an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her\\ninto a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her\\nmouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at\\nthe Ministry of Magic ... maybe that’s why Bagman\\ndidn’t bother to look for her for so long. ...”\\nSirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his\\nshadowed eyes.\\n“What’s the time?”\\nHarry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn’t\\nbeen working since it had spent over an hour in the\\nlake.\\n“It’s half past three,” said Hermione.\\n“You’d better get back to school,” Sirius said, getting\\nto his feet. “Now listen ...” He looked particularly hard\\n \\nat Harry. “I don’t want you lot sneaking out of school\\nto see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still\\nwant to hear about anything odd. But you’re not to go\\nleaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an\\nideal opportunity for someone to attack you.”\\n“No one’s tried to attack me so far, except a dragon\\nand a couple of grindylows,” Harry said, but Sirius\\nscowled at him.\\n“I don’t care ... I’ll breathe freely again when this\\ntournament’s over, and that’s not until June. And\\ndon’t forget, if you’re talking about me among\\nyourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?”\\nHe handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and\\nwent to pat Buckbeak good-bye. “I’ll walk to the edge\\nof the village with you,” said Sirius, “see if I can\\nscrounge another paper.”\\nHe transformed into the great black dog before they\\nleft the cave, and they walked back down the\\nmountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn\\nground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of\\nthem to pat him on the head, before turning and\\nsetting off at a run around the outskirts of the village.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into\\nHogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts.\\n“Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?”\\nRon said as they walked up the drive to the castle.\\n“But maybe he doesn’t care ... it’d probably just make\\nhim admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves\\nrules. He’d just say Crouch was refusing to break\\nthem for his own son.”\\n“Percy would never throw any of his family to the\\ndementors,” said Hermione severely.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I don’t know,” said Ron. “If he thought we were\\nstanding in the way of his career . . . Percy’s really\\nambitious, you know. ...”\\nThey walked up the stone steps into the entrance\\nhall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted\\ntoward them from the Great Hall.\\n“Poor old Snuffles,” said Ron, breathing deeply. “He\\nmust really like you, Harry. ... Imagine having to live\\noff rats.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE MADNESS OF MR. CROUCH\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery\\nafter breakfast on Sunday to send a letter to Percy,\\nasking, as Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen\\nMr. Crouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had\\nbeen so long since she’d had a job. When they had\\nwatched her fly out of sight through the Owlery\\nwindow, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give\\nDobby his new socks.\\nThe house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome,\\nbowing and curtsying and bustling around making\\ntea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present.\\n“Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!” he squeaked,\\nwiping large tears out of his enormous eyes.\\n“You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you\\nreally did,” said Harry.\\n“No chance of more of those eclairs, is there?” said\\nRon, who was looking around at the beaming and\\nbowing house-elves.\\n \\n“You’ve just had breakfast!” said Hermione irritably,\\nbut a great silver platter of eclairs was already\\nzooming toward them, supported by four elves.\\n“We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,”\\nHarry muttered.\\n“Good idea,” said Ron. “Give Pig something to do. You\\ncouldn’t give us a bit of extra food, could you?” he\\nsaid to the surrounding elves, and they bowed\\ndelightedly and hurried off to get some more.\\n“Dobby, where’s Winky?” said Hermione, who was\\nlooking around.\\n“Winky is over there by the fire, miss,” said Dobby\\nquietly, his ears drooping slightly.\\n“Oh dear,” said Hermione as she spotted Winky.\\nHarry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was\\nsitting on the same stool as last time, but she had\\nallowed herself to become so filthy that she was not\\nimmediately distinguishable from the smoke-\\nblackened brick behind her. Her clothes were ragged\\nand unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of\\nbutterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring\\ninto the fire. As they watched her, she gave an\\nenormous hiccup.\\n“Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,”\\nDobby whispered to Harry.\\n“Well, it’s not strong, that stuff,” Harry said.\\nBut Dobby shook his head. “ Tis strong for a house-\\nelf, sir,” he said.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nWinky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the\\neclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned\\nto work.\\n“Winky is pining, Harry Potter,” Dobby whispered\\nsadly. “Winky wants to go home. Winky still thinks\\nMr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby\\nsays will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is\\nher master now.”\\n“Hey, Winky,” said Harry, struck by a sudden\\ninspiration, walking over to her, and bending down,\\n“you don’t know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do\\nyou? Because he’s stopped turning up to judge the\\nTriwizard Tournament.”\\nWinky’s eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused\\non Harry. She swayed slightly again and then said, “M\\n— Master is stopped — hie — coming?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “we haven’t seen him since the\\nfirst task. The Daily Prophet’s saying he’s ill.”\\nWinky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.\\n“Master — hie — ill?”\\nHer bottom lip began to tremble.\\n“But we’re not sure if that’s true,” said Hermione\\nquickly.\\n“Master is needing his — hie — Winky!” whimpered\\nthe elf. “Master cannot — hie — manage — hie — all\\nby himself. ...”\\n“Other people manage to do their own housework,\\nyou know, Winky,” Hermione said severely.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Winky — hie — is not only — hie — doing housework\\nfor Mr. Crouch!” Winky squeaked indignantly,\\nswaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer\\ndown her already heavily stained blouse. “Master is —\\nhie — trusting Winky with — hie — the most\\nimportant — hie — the most secret — ”\\n“What?” said Harry.\\nBut Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more\\nbutterbeer down herself.\\n“Winky keeps — hie — her master’s secrets,” she said\\nmutinously, swaying very heavily now, frowning up at\\nHarry with her eyes crossed. “You is — hie — nosing,\\nyou is.”\\n“Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!” said\\nDobby angrily. “Harry Potter is brave and noble and\\nHarry Potter is not nosy!”\\n“He is nosing — hie — into my master’s — hie —\\nprivate and secret — hie — Winky is a good house-elf\\n— hie — Winky keeps her silence — hie — people\\ntrying to — hie — pry and poke — hie — ”\\nWinky’s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without\\nwarning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring\\nloudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away\\nacross the stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen house-\\nelves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted. One\\nof them picked up the bottle; the others covered\\nWinky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the\\nends in neatly, hiding her from view.\\n“We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!”\\nsqueaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking\\nvery ashamed. “We is hoping you will not judge us all\\nby Winky, sirs and miss!”\\n \\n“She’s unhappy!” said Hermione, exasperated. “Why\\ndon’t you try and cheer her up instead of covering her\\nup?”\\n“Begging your pardon, miss,” said the house-elf,\\nbowing deeply again, “but house-elves has no right to\\nbe unhappy when there is work to be done and\\nmasters to be served.”\\n“Oh for heaven’s sake!” Hermione cried. “Listen to me,\\nall of you! You’ve got just as much right as wizards to\\nbe unhappy! You’ve got the right to wages and\\nholidays and proper clothes, you don’t have to do\\neverything you’re told — look at Dobby!”\\n“Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,” Dobby\\nmumbled, looking scared. The cheery smiles had\\nvanished from the faces of the house-elves around the\\nkitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as\\nthough she were mad and dangerous.\\n“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at Harry’s\\nelbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and\\nsome fruit into Harry’s arms. “Good-bye!”\\nThe house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione and began shunting them out of the\\nkitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of\\ntheir backs.\\n“Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!” Dobby called\\nmiserably from the hearth, where he was standing\\nnext to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky.\\n“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you,\\nHermione?” said Ron angrily as the kitchen door\\nslammed shut behind them. “They won’t want us\\nvisiting them now! We could’ve tried to get more stuff\\nout of Winky about Crouch!”\\n \\n“Oh as if you care about that!” scoffed Hermione. “You\\nonly like coming down here for the food!”\\nIt was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so\\ntired of Ron and Hermione sniping at each other over\\ntheir homework in the common room that he took\\nSirius’s food up to the Owlery that evening on his\\nown.\\nPigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire\\nham up to the mountain by himself, so Harry enlisted\\nthe help of two school screech owls as well. When\\nthey had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd\\ncarrying the large package between them, Harry\\nleaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds,\\nat the dark, rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest,\\nand the rippling sails of the Durmstrang ship. An\\neagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from\\nHagrid’s chimney; it soared toward the castle, around\\nthe Owlery, and out of sight. Looking down, Harry\\nsaw Hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin.\\nHarry wondered what he was doing; it looked as\\nthough he were making a new vegetable patch. As he\\nwatched, Madame Maxime emerged from the\\nBeauxbatons carriage and walked over to Hagrid. She\\nappeared to be trying to engage him in conversation.\\nHagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen\\nto prolong their talk, because Madame Maxime\\nreturned to the carriage shortly afterward.\\nUnwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to\\nRon and Hermione snarling at each other, Harry\\nwatched Hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed\\nhim and the owls around Harry began to awake,\\nswooshing past him into the night.\\nBy breakfast the next day Ron’s and Hermione’s bad\\nmoods had burnt out, and to Harry’s relief, Ron’s\\ndark predictions that the house-elves would send\\n \\nsubstandard food up to the Gryffindor table because\\nHermione had insulted them proved false; the bacon,\\neggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.\\nWhen the post owls arrived, Hermione looked up\\neagerly; she seemed to be expecting something.\\n“Percy won’t’ve had time to answer yet,” said Ron. “We\\nonly sent Hedwig yesterday.”\\n“No, it’s not that,” said Hermione. “I’ve taken out a\\nsubscription to the Daily Prophet I’m getting sick of\\nfinding everything out from the Slytherins.”\\n“Good thinking!” said Harry, also looking up at the\\nowls. “Hey, Hermione, I think you’re in luck — ”\\nA gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.\\n“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking\\ndisappointed. “It’s — ”\\nBut to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front\\nof her plate, closely followed by four barn owls, a\\nbrown owl, and a tawny.\\n“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said\\nHarry, seizing Hermione ’s goblet before it was\\nknocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were\\njostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter\\nfirst.\\n“What on earth — ?” Hermione said, taking the letter\\nfrom the gray owl, opening it, and starting to read.\\n“Oh really!” she sputtered, going rather red.\\n“What’s up?” said Ron.\\n“It’s — oh how ridiculous — ”\\n \\nShe thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was\\nnot handwritten, but composed from pasted letters\\nthat seemed to have been cut out of the Daily Prophet.\\nYou are a WickEd giRL. HarRy PotTER desErves\\nBeTteR. GO back wherE you cAMe from mUGgle.\\n“They’re all like it!” said Hermione desperately,\\nopening one letter after another. “ ‘Harry Potter can do\\nmuch better than the likes of you. ...’ ‘You deserve to\\nbe boiled in frog spawn. ...’ Ouch!”\\nShe had opened the last envelope, and yellowish-\\ngreen liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over\\nher hands, which began to erupt in large yellow boils.\\n“Undiluted bubotuber pus!” said Ron, picking up the\\nenvelope gingerly and sniffing it.\\n“Ow!” said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she\\ntried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin, but\\nher fingers were now so thickly covered in painful\\nsores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair\\nof thick, knobbly gloves.\\n“You’d better get up to the hospital wing,” said Harry\\nas the owls around Hermione took flight. “We’ll tell\\nProfessor Sprout where you’ve gone. ...”\\n“I warned her!” said Ron as Hermione hurried out of\\nthe Great Hall, cradling her hands. “I warned her not\\nto annoy Rita Skeeter! Look at this one ...” He read\\nout one of the letters Hermione had left behind: “ ‘I\\nread in Witch Weekly about how you are playing\\nHarry Potter false and that boy has had enough\\nhardship and I will be sending you a curse by next\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\npost as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.’\\nBlimey, she’d better watch out for herself.”\\nHermione didn’t turn up for Herbology. As Harry and\\nRon left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical\\nCreatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\\ndescending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy\\nParkinson was whispering and giggling behind them\\nwith her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of\\nHarry, Pansy called, “Potter, have you split up with\\nyour girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?”\\nHarry ignored her; he didn’t want to give her the\\nsatisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch\\nWeekly article had caused.\\nHagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had\\nfinished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside\\nhis cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his\\nfeet. Harry’s heart sank at the sight of the crates —\\nsurely not another skrewt hatching? — but when he\\ngot near enough to see inside, he found himself\\nlooking at a number of fluffy black creatures with\\nlong snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like\\nspades, and they were blinking up at the class,\\nlooking politely puzzled at all the attention.\\n“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had\\ngathered around. “Yeh find ’em down mines mostly.\\nThey like sparkly stuff. ... There yeh go, look.”\\nOne of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and\\nattempted to bite Pansy Parkinson’s watch off her\\nwrist. She shrieked and jumped backward.\\n“Useful little treasure detectors,” said Hagrid happily.\\n“Thought we’d have some fun with ’em today. See over\\nthere?” He pointed at the large patch of freshly turned\\nearth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery\\n \\nwindow. “I’ve buried some gold coins. I’ve got a prize\\nfer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most. Jus’\\ntake off all yer valuables, an’ choose a niffler, an’ get\\nready ter set ’em loose.”\\nHarry took off his watch, which he was only wearing\\nout of habit, as it didn’t work anymore, and stuffed it\\ninto his pocket. Then he picked up a niffler. It put its\\nlong snout in Harry’s ear and sniffed enthusiastically.\\nIt was really quite cuddly.\\n“Hang on,” said Hagrid, looking down into the crate,\\n“there’s a spare niffler here ... who’s missin’? Where’s\\nHermione?”\\n“She had to go to the hospital wing,” said Ron.\\n“Well explain later,” Harry muttered; Pansy\\nParkinson was listening.\\nIt was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care\\nof Magical Creatures. The nifflers dived in and out of\\nthe patch of earth as though it were water, each\\nscurrying back to the student who had released it and\\nspitting gold into their hands. Ron’s was particularly\\nefficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins.\\n“Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?” he asked\\nexcitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil,\\nsplattering his robes.\\n“Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, Ron,” said Hagrid,\\ngrinning. “They wreck houses, nifflers. I reckon\\nthey’ve nearly got the lot, now,” he added, pacing\\naround the patch of earth while the nifflers continued\\nto dive. “I on’y buried a hundred coins. Oh there\\ny’are, Hermione!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHermione was walking toward them across the lawn.\\nHer hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked\\nmiserable. Pansy Parkinson was watching her\\nbeadily.\\n“Well, let’s check how yeh’ve done!” said Hagrid.\\n“Count yer coins! An’ there’s no point tryin’ ter steal\\nany, Goyle,” he added, his beetle-black eyes\\nnarrowed. “It’s leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a few\\nhours.”\\nGoyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky. It\\nturned out that Ron’s niffler had been most\\nsuccessful, so Hagrid gave him an enormous slab of\\nHoneydukes chocolate for a prize. The bell rang\\nacross the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set\\noff back to the castle, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\nstayed behind to help Hagrid put the nifflers back in\\ntheir boxes. Harry noticed Madame Maxime watching\\nthem out of her carriage window.\\n“What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?” said\\nHagrid, looking concerned.\\nHermione told him about the hate mail she had\\nreceived that morning, and the envelope full of\\nbubotuber pus.\\n“Aaah, don’ worry,” said Hagrid gently, looking down\\nat her. “I got some o’ those letters an’ all, after Rita\\nSkeeter wrote abou’ me mum. ‘Yeh’re a monster an’\\nyeh should be put down.’ ‘Yer mother killed innocent\\npeople an’ if you had any decency you’d jump in a\\nlake. ’ ”\\n“No!” said Hermione, looking shocked.\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by\\nhis cabin wall. “They’re jus’ nutters, Hermione. Don’\\n \\nopen ’em if yeh get any more. Chuck ’em straigh’ in\\nthe fire.”\\n“You missed a really good lesson,” Harry told\\nHermione as they headed back toward the castle.\\n“They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they, Ron?”\\nRon, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid\\nhad given him. He looked thoroughly put out about\\nsomething.\\n“What’s the matter?” said Harry. “Wrong flavor?”\\n“No,” said Ron shortly. “Why didn’t you tell me about\\nthe gold?”\\n“What gold?” said Harry.\\n“The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,”\\nsaid Ron. “The leprechaun gold I gave you for my\\nOmnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn’t you tell me\\nit disappeared?”\\nHarry had to think for a moment before he realized\\nwhat Ron was talking about.\\n“Oh ...” he said, the memory coming back to him at\\nlast. “I dunno ... I never noticed it had gone. I was\\nmore worried about my wand, wasn’t I?”\\nThey climbed the steps into the entrance hall and\\nwent into the Great Hall for lunch.\\n“Must be nice,” Ron said abruptly, when they had sat\\ndown and started serving themselves roast beef and\\nYorkshire puddings. “To have so much money you\\ndon’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!” said\\nHarry impatiently. “We all did, remember?”\\n“I didn’t know leprechaun gold vanishes,” Ron\\nmuttered. “I thought I was paying you back. You\\nshouldn’t ’ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat for\\nChristmas.”\\n“Forget it, all right?” said Harry.\\nRon speared a roast potato on the end of his fork,\\nglaring at it. Then he said, “I hate being poor.”\\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other. Neither of\\nthem really knew what to say.\\n“It’s rubbish,” said Ron, still glaring down at his\\npotato. “I don’t blame Fred and George for trying to\\nmake some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a\\nniffler.”\\n“Well, we know what to get you next Christmas,” said\\nHermione brightly. Then, when Ron continued to look\\ngloomy, she said, “Come on, Ron, it could be worse.\\nAt least your fingers aren’t full of pus.” Hermione was\\nhaving a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork,\\nher fingers were so stiff and swollen. “I hate that\\nSkeeter woman!” she burst out savagely. “I’ll get her\\nback for this if it’s the last thing I do!”\\nHate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the\\nfollowing week, and although she followed Hagrid’s\\nadvice and stopped opening it, several of her ill-\\nwishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the\\nGryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the\\nwhole Hall to hear. Even those people who didn’t read\\nWitch Weekly knew all about the supposed Harry-\\n \\nKrum-Hermione triangle now. Harry was getting sick\\nof telling people that Hermione wasn’t his girlfriend.\\n“It’ll die down, though,” he told Hermione, “if we just\\nignore it. ... People got bored with that stuff she wrote\\nabout me last time — ”\\n“I want to know how she’s listening into private\\nconversations when she’s supposed to be banned\\nfrom the grounds!” said Hermione angrily.\\nHermione hung back in their next Defense Against\\nthe Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody\\nsomething. The rest of the class was very eager to\\nleave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of\\nhex-deflection that many of them were nursing small\\ninjuries. Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears,\\nhe had to hold his hands clamped over them as he\\nwalked away from the class.\\n“Well, Rita’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!”\\nHermione panted five minutes later, catching up with\\nHarry and Ron in the entrance hall and pulling\\nHarry’s hand away from one of his wiggling ears so\\nthat he could hear her. “Moody says he didn’t see her\\nanywhere near the judges’ table at the second task, or\\nanywhere near the lake!”\\n“Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop\\nthis?” said Ron.\\n“No!” said Hermione stubbornly. “I want to know how\\nshe heard me talking to Viktor! And how she found\\nout about Hagrid’s mum!”\\n“Maybe she had you bugged,” said Harry.\\n“Bugged?” said Ron blankly. “What ... put fleas on her\\nor something?”\\n \\nHarry started explaining about hidden microphones\\nand recording equipment. Ron was fascinated, but\\nHermione interrupted them.\\n“Aren’t you two ever going to read Hogwarts, A\\nHistory?”\\n“What’s the point?” said Ron. “You know it by heart,\\nwe can just ask you.”\\n“All those substitutes for magic Muggles use —\\nelectricity, computers, and radar, and all those things\\n— they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there’s too\\nmuch magic in the air. No, Rita’s using magic to\\neavesdrop, she must be. ... If I could just find out\\nwhat it is ... ooh, if it’s illegal, I’ll have her ...”\\n“Haven’t we got enough to worry about?” Ron asked\\nher. “Do we have to start a vendetta against Rita\\nSkeeter as well?”\\n“I’m not asking you to help!” Hermione snapped. “I’ll\\ndo it on my own!”\\nShe marched back up the marble staircase without a\\nbackward glance. Harry was quite sure she was going\\nto the library.\\n“What’s the betting she comes back with a box of /\\nHate Rita Skeeter badges?” said Ron.\\nHermione, however, did not ask Harry and Ron to\\nhelp her pursue vengeance against Rita Skeeter, for\\nwhich they were both grateful, because their workload\\nwas mounting ever higher in the days before the\\nEaster holidays. Harry frankly marveled at the fact\\nthat Hermione could research magical methods of\\neavesdropping as well as everything else they had to\\ndo. He was working flat-out just to get through all\\n \\ntheir homework, though he made a point of sending\\nregular food packages up to the cave in the mountain\\nfor Sirius; after last summer, Harry had not forgotten\\nwhat it felt like to be continually hungry. He enclosed\\nnotes to Sirius, telling him that nothing out of the\\nordinary had happened, and that they were still\\nwaiting for an answer from Percy.\\nHedwig didn’t return until the end of the Easter\\nholidays. Percy’s letter was enclosed in a package of\\nEaster eggs that Mrs. Weasley had sent. Both Harry’s\\nand Ron’s were the size of dragon eggs and full of\\nhomemade toffee. Hermione’s, however, was smaller\\nthan a chicken egg. Her face fell when she saw it.\\n“Your mum doesn’t read Witch Weekly, by any\\nchance, does she, Ron?” she asked quietly.\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee.\\n“Gets it for the recipes.”\\nHermione looked sadly at her tiny egg.\\n“Don’t you want to see what Percy’s written?” Harry\\nasked her hastily.\\nPercy’s letter was short and irritated.\\nAs I am constantly telling the Daily Prophet, Mr.\\nCrouch is taking a well-deserved break. He is sending\\nin regular owls with instructions. No, I haven’t actually\\nseen him, but I think I can be trusted to know my own\\nsuperior’s handwriting. I have quite enough to do at\\nthe moment without trying to quash these ridiculous\\nrumors. Please don’t bother me again unless it’s\\nsomething important. Happy Easter.\\nThe start of the summer term would normally have\\nmeant that Harry was training hard for the last\\n \\nQuidditch match of the season. This year, however, it\\nwas the third and final task in the Triwizard\\nTournament for which he needed to prepare, but he\\nstill didn’t know what he would have to do. Finally, in\\nthe last week of May, Professor McGonagall held him\\nback in Transfiguration.\\n“You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at\\nnine o’clock, Potter,” she told him. “Mr. Bagman will\\nbe there to tell the champions about the third task.”\\nSo at half past eight that night, Harry left Ron and\\nHermione in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs.\\nAs he crossed the entrance hall, Cedric came up from\\nthe Hufflepuff common room.\\n“What d’you reckon it’s going to be?” he asked Harry\\nas they went together down the stone steps, out into\\nthe cloudy night. “Fleur keeps going on about\\nunderground tunnels; she reckons we’ve got to find\\ntreasure.”\\n“That wouldn’t be too bad,” said Harry, thinking that\\nhe would simply ask Hagrid for a niffler to do the job\\nfor him.\\nThey walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch\\nstadium, turned through a gap in the stands, and\\nwalked out onto the field.\\n“What’ve they done to it?” Cedric said indignantly,\\nstopping dead.\\nThe Quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat. It\\nlooked as though somebody had been building long,\\nlow walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in\\nevery direction.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“They’re hedges!” said Harry, bending to examine the\\nnearest one.\\n“Hello there!” called a cheery voice.\\nLudo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field\\nwith Krum and Fleur. Harry and Cedric made their\\nway toward them, climbing over the hedges. Fleur\\nbeamed at Harry as he came nearer. Her attitude\\ntoward him had changed completely since he had\\nsaved her sister from the lake.\\n“Well, what d’you think?” said Bagman happily as\\nHarry and Cedric climbed over the last hedge.\\n“Growing nicely, aren’t they? Give them a month and\\nHagrid’ll have them twenty feet high. Don’t worry,” he\\nadded, grinning, spotting the less-than-happy\\nexpressions on Harry’s and Cedric’s faces, “you’ll have\\nyour Quidditch field back to normal once the task is\\nover! Now, I imagine you can guess what we’re\\nmaking here?”\\nNo one spoke for a moment. Then —\\n“Maze,” grunted Krum.\\n“That’s right!” said Bagman. “A maze. The third task’s\\nreally very straightforward. The Triwizard Cup will be\\nplaced in the center of the maze. The first champion\\nto touch it will receive full marks.”\\n“We seemply ’ave to get through the maze?” said\\nFleur.\\n“There will be obstacles,” said Bagman happily,\\nbouncing on the balls of his feet. “Hagrid is providing\\na number of creatures . . . then there will be spells that\\nmust be broken ... all that sort of thing, you know.\\nNow, the champions who are leading on points will\\n \\nget a head start into the maze.” Bagman grinned at\\nHarry and Cedric. “Then Mr. Krum will enter ... then\\nMiss Delacour. But you 11 all be in with a fighting\\nchance, depending how well you get past the\\nobstacles. Should be fun, eh?”\\nHarry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures\\nthat Hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this,\\nthought it was unlikely to be any fun at all. However,\\nhe nodded politely like the other champions.\\n“Very well ... if you haven’t got any questions, we’ll go\\nback up to the castle, shall we, it’s a bit chilly. ...”\\nBagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to\\nwend their way out of the growing maze. Harry had\\nthe feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to\\nhelp him again, but just then, Krum tapped Harry on\\nthe shoulder.\\n“Could I haff a vord?”\\n“Yeah, all right,” said Harry, slightly surprised.\\n“Vill you valk vith me?”\\n“Okay,” said Harry curiously.\\nBagman looked slightly perturbed.\\n“I’ll wait for you, Harry, shall I?”\\n“No, it’s okay, Mr. Bagman,” said Harry, suppressing\\na smile, “I think I can find the castle on my own,\\nthanks.”\\nHarry and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum\\ndid not set a course for the Durmstrang ship. Instead,\\nhe walked toward the forest.\\n \\n“What ’re we going this way for?” said Harry as they\\npassed Hagrid’s cabin and the illuminated\\nBeauxbatons carriage.\\n“Don’t vant to be overheard,” said Krum shortly.\\nWhen at last they had reached a quiet stretch of\\nground a short way from the Beauxbatons horses’\\npaddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and\\nturned to face Harry.\\n“I vant to know,” he said, glowering, “vot there is\\nbetween you and Hermy-own-ninny.”\\nHarry, who from Krum’s secretive manner had\\nexpected something much more serious than this,\\nstared up at Krum in amazement.\\n“Nothing,” he said. But Krum glowered at him, and\\nHarry, somehow struck anew by how tall Krum was,\\nelaborated. “We’re friends. She’s not my girlfriend and\\nshe never has been. It’s just that Skeeter woman\\nmaking things up.”\\n“Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often,” said\\nKrum, looking suspiciously at Harry.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “because we’re friends.”\\nHe couldn’t quite believe he was having this\\nconversation with Viktor Krum, the famous\\nInternational Quidditch player. It was as though the\\neighteen-year-old Krum thought he, Harry, was an\\nequal — a real rival —\\n“You haff never ... you haff not ...”\\n“No,” said Harry very firmly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nKrum looked slightly happier. He stared at Harry for a\\nfew seconds, then said, “You fly very veil. I vos\\nvotching at the first task.”\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly\\nfeeling much taller himself. “I saw you at the\\nQuidditch World Cup. The Wronski Feint, you really\\nBut something moved behind Krum in the trees, and\\nHarry, who had some experience of the sort of thing\\nthat lurked in the forest, instinctively grabbed Krum’s\\narm and pulled him around.\\n“Vot is it?”\\nHarry shook his head, staring at the place where he’d\\nseen movement. He slipped his hand inside his robes,\\nreaching for his wand.\\nSuddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak.\\nFor a moment, Harry didn’t recognize him ... then he\\nrealized it was Mr. Crouch.\\nHe looked as though he had been traveling for days.\\nThe knees of his robes were ripped and bloody, his\\nface scratched; he was unshaven and gray with\\nexhaustion. His neat hair and mustache were both in\\nneed of a wash and a trim. His strange appearance,\\nhowever, was nothing to the way he was behaving.\\nMuttering and gesticulating, Mr. Crouch appeared to\\nbe talking to someone that he alone could see. He\\nreminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen\\nonce when out shopping with the Dursleys. That man\\ntoo had been conversing wildly with thin air; Aunt\\nPetunia had seized Dudley’s hand and pulled him\\nacross the road to avoid him; Uncle Vernon had then\\ntreated the family to a long rant about what he would\\nlike to do with beggars and vagrants.\\n \\n“Vosn’t he a judge?” said Krum, staring at Mr.\\nCrouch. “Isn’t he vith your Ministry?”\\nHarry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked\\nslowly toward Mr. Crouch, who did not look at him,\\nbut continued to talk to a nearby tree.\\n\"... and when you’ve done that, Weatherby, send an\\nowl to Dumbledore confirming the number of\\nDurmstrang students who will be attending the\\ntournament, Karkaroff has just sent word there will\\nbe twelve. ...”\\n“Mr. Crouch?” said Harry cautiously.\\n\"... and then send another owl to Madame Maxime,\\nbecause she might want to up the number of\\nstudents she’s bringing, now Karkaroff’s made it a\\nround dozen ... do that, Weatherby, will you? Will\\nyou? Will...”\\nMr. Crouch’s eyes were bulging. He stood staring at\\nthe tree, muttering soundlessly at it. Then he\\nstaggered sideways and fell to his knees.\\n“Mr. Crouch?” Harry said loudly. “Are you all right?”\\nCrouch’s eyes were rolling in his head. Harry looked\\naround at Krum, who had followed him into the trees,\\nand was looking down at Crouch in alarm.\\n“Vot is wrong with him?”\\n“No idea,” Harry muttered. “Listen, you’d better go\\nand get someone — ”\\n“Dumbledore!” gasped Mr. Crouch. He reached out\\nand seized a handful of Harry’s robes, dragging him\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ncloser, though his eyes were staring over Harry’s\\nhead. “I need ... see ... Dumbledore. ...”\\n“Okay,” said Harry, “if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can\\ngo up to the — ”\\n“I’ve done ... stupid ... thing ...” Mr. Crouch breathed.\\nHe looked utterly mad. His eyes were rolling and\\nbulging, and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his\\nchin. Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a\\nterrible effort. “Must ... tell ... Dumbledore ...”\\n“Get up, Mr. Crouch,” said Harry loudly and clearly.\\n“Get up, I’ll take you to Dumbledore!”\\nMr. Crouch’s eyes rolled forward onto Harry.\\n“Who ... you?” he whispered.\\n“I’m a student at the school,” said Harry, looking\\naround at Krum for some help, but Krum was\\nhanging back, looking extremely nervous.\\n“You’re not ... his?” whispered Crouch, his mouth\\nsagging.\\n“No,” said Harry, without the faintest idea what\\nCrouch was talking about.\\n“Dumbledore ’s?”\\n“That’s right,” said Harry.\\nCrouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen\\nCrouch’s grip on his robes, but it was too powerful.\\n“Warn ... Dumbledore ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I’ll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,” said Harry.\\n“Just let go, Mr. Crouch, and I’ll get him. ...”\\n“Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done\\nthat, I would like a cup of tea. My wife and son will be\\narriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight\\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Fudge.”\\nCrouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and\\nseemed completely unaware that Harry was there,\\nwhich surprised Harry so much he didn’t notice that\\nCrouch had released him.\\n“Yes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.L.s,\\nmost satisfactory, yes, thank you, yes, very proud\\nindeed. Now, if you could bring me that memo from\\nthe Andorran Minister of Magic, I think I will have\\ntime to draft a response. ...”\\n“You stay here with him!” Harry said to Krum. “I’ll get\\nDumbledore, I’ll be quicker, I know where his office is\\n“He is mad,” said Krum doubtfully, staring down at\\nCrouch, who was still gabbling to the tree, apparently\\nconvinced it was Percy.\\n“Just stay with him,” said Harry, starting to get up,\\nbut his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt\\nchange in Mr. Crouch, who seized him hard around\\nthe knees and pulled Harry back to the ground.\\n“Don’t ... leave ... me!” he whispered, his eyes bulging\\nagain. “I ... escaped . . . must warn . . . must tell . . . see\\nDumbledore . . . my fault ... all my fault . . . Bertha . . .\\ndead ... all my fault . . . my son . . . my fault . . . tell\\nDumbledore . . . Harry Potter . . . the Dark Lord . . .\\nstronger ... Harry Potter ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I’ll get Dumbledore if you let me go, Mr. Crouch!”\\nsaid Harry. He looked furiously around at Krum.\\n“Help me, will you?”\\nLooking extremely apprehensive, Krum moved\\nforward and squatted down next to Mr. Crouch.\\n“Just keep him here,” said Harry, pulling himself free\\nof Mr. Crouch. “I’ll be back with Dumbledore.”\\n“Hurry, von’t you?” Krum called after him as Harry\\nsprinted away from the forest and up through the\\ndark grounds. They were deserted; Bagman, Cedric,\\nand Fleur had disappeared. Harry tore up the stone\\nsteps, through the oak front doors, and off up the\\nmarble staircase, toward the second floor.\\nFive minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone\\ngargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridor.\\n“Sher — sherbet lemon!” he panted at it.\\nThis was the password to the hidden staircase to\\nDumbledore ’s office — or at least, it had been two\\nyears ago. The password had evidently changed,\\nhowever, for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life\\nand jump aside, but stood frozen, glaring at Harry\\nmalevolently.\\n“Move!” Harry shouted at it. “C’mon!”\\nBut nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because\\nhe shouted at it; he knew it was no good. He looked\\nup and down the dark corridor. Perhaps Dumbledore\\nwas in the staffroom? He started running as fast as\\nhe could toward the staircase —\\n“POTTER!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry skidded to a halt and looked around. Snape\\nhad just emerged from the hidden staircase behind\\nthe stone gargoyle. The wall was sliding shut behind\\nhim even as he beckoned Harry back toward him.\\n“What are you doing here, Potter?”\\n“I need to see Professor Dumbledore!” said Harry,\\nrunning back up the corridor and skidding to a\\nstandstill in front of Snape instead. “It’s Mr. Crouch\\n... he’s just turned up ... he’s in the forest ... he’s\\nasking — ”\\n“What is this rubbish?” said Snape, his black eyes\\nglittering. “What are you talking about?”\\n“Mr. Crouch!” Harry shouted. “From the Ministry!\\nHe’s ill or something — he’s in the forest, he wants to\\nsee Dumbledore! Just give me the password up to — ”\\n“The headmaster is busy, Potter,” said Snape, his thin\\nmouth curling into an unpleasant smile.\\n“I’ve got to tell Dumbledore!” Harry yelled.\\n“Didn’t you hear me, Potter?”\\nHarry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying\\nhimself, denying Harry the thing he wanted when he\\nwas so panicky.\\n“Look,” said Harry angrily, “Crouch isn’t right — he’s\\n— he’s out of his mind — he says he wants to warn —\\nThe stone wall behind Snape slid open. Dumbledore\\nwas standing there, wearing long green robes and a\\nmildly curious expression. “Is there a problem?” he\\nsaid, looking between Harry and Snape.\\n \\n“Professor!” Harry said, sidestepping Snape before\\nSnape could speak, “Mr. Crouch is here — he’s down\\nin the forest, he wants to speak to you!”\\nHarry expected Dumbledore to ask questions, but to\\nhis relief, Dumbledore did nothing of the sort.\\n“Lead the way,” he said promptly, and he swept off\\nalong the corridor behind Harry, leaving Snape\\nstanding next to the gargoyle and looking twice as\\nugly.\\n“What did Mr. Crouch say, Harry?” said Dumbledore\\nas they walked swiftly down the marble staircase.\\n“Said he wants to warn you ... said he’s done\\nsomething terrible ... he mentioned his son . . . and\\nBertha Jorkins ... and — and Voldemort ... something\\nabout Voldemort getting stronger. ...”\\n“Indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he quickened his\\npace as they hurried out into the pitch-darkness.\\n“He’s not acting normally,” Harry said, hurrying along\\nbeside Dumbledore. “He doesn’t seem to know where\\nhe is. He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley’s\\nthere, and then he changes, and says he needs to see\\nyou. ... I left him with Viktor Krum.”\\n“You did?” said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to\\ntake longer strides still, so that Harry was running to\\nkeep up. “Do you know if anybody else saw Mr.\\nCrouch?”\\n“No,” said Harry. “Krum and I were talking, Mr.\\nBagman had just finished telling us about the third\\ntask, we stayed behind, and then we saw Mr. Crouch\\ncoming out of the forest — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Where are they?” said Dumbledore as the\\nBeauxbatons carriage emerged from the darkness.\\n“Over here,” said Harry, moving in front of\\nDumbledore, leading the way through the trees. He\\ncouldn’t hear Crouch’s voice anymore, but he knew\\nwhere he was going; it hadn’t been much past the\\nBeauxbatons carriage ... somewhere around here. ...\\n“Viktor?” Harry shouted.\\nNo one answered.\\n“They were here,” Harry said to Dumbledore. “They\\nwere definitely somewhere around here. ...”\\n“Lumos,” Dumbledore said, lighting his wand and\\nholding it up.\\nIts narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black\\ntrunk, illuminating the ground. And then it fell upon\\na pair of feet.\\nHarry and Dumbledore hurried forward. Krum was\\nsprawled on the forest floor. He seemed to be\\nunconscious. There was no sign at all of Mr. Crouch.\\nDumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of\\nhis eyelids.\\n“Stunned,” he said softly. His half-moon glasses\\nglittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the\\nsurrounding trees.\\n“Should I go and get someone?” said Harry. “Madam\\nPomfrey?”\\n“No,” said Dumbledore swiftly. “Stay here.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHe raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the\\ndirection of Hagrid ’s cabin. Harry saw something\\nsilvery dart out of it and streak away through the\\ntrees like a ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore bent over\\nKrum again, pointed his wand at him, and muttered,\\n“Renneruate.”\\nKrum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw\\nDumbledore, he tried to sit up, but Dumbledore put a\\nhand on his shoulder and made him lie still.\\n“He attacked me!” Krum muttered, putting a hand up\\nto his head. “The old madman attacked me! I vos\\nlooking around to see vare Potter had gone and he\\nattacked from behind!”\\n“Lie still for a moment,” Dumbledore said.\\nThe sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and\\nHagrid came panting into sight with Fang at his\\nheels. He was carrying his crossbow.\\n“Professor Dumbledore!” he said, his eyes widening.\\n“Harry — what the — ?”\\n“Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,” said\\nDumbledore. “His student has been attacked. When\\nyou’ve done that, kindly alert Professor Moody — ”\\n“No need, Dumbledore,” said a wheezy growl. “I’m\\nhere.”\\nMoody was limping toward them, leaning on his staff,\\nhis wand lit.\\n“Damn leg,” he said furiously. “Would’ve been here\\nquicker ... what’s happened? Snape said something\\nabout Crouch — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Crouch?” said Hagrid blankly.\\n“Karkaroff, please, Hagrid!” said Dumbledore sharply.\\n“Oh yeah ... right y’are, Professor ...” said Hagrid, and\\nhe turned and disappeared into the dark trees, Fang\\ntrotting after him.\\n“I don’t know where Barty Crouch is,” Dumbledore\\ntold Moody, “but it is essential that we find him.”\\n“I’m onto it,” growled Moody, and he pulled out his\\nwand and limped off into the forest.\\nNeither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they\\nheard the unmistakable sounds of Hagrid and Fang\\nreturning. Karkaroff was hurrying along behind them.\\nHe was wearing his sleek silver furs, and he looked\\npale and agitated.\\n“What is this?” he cried when he saw Krum on the\\nground and Dumbledore and Harry beside him.\\n“What’s going on?”\\n“I vos attacked!” said Krum, sitting up now and\\nrubbing his head. “Mr. Crouch or votever his name —\\n“Crouch attacked you? Crouch attacked you? The\\nTriwizard judge?”\\n“Igor,” Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn\\nhimself up, clutching his furs around him, looking\\nlivid.\\n“Treachery!” he bellowed, pointing at Dumbledore. “It\\nis a plot! You and your Ministry of Magic have lured\\nme here under false pretenses, Dumbledore! This is\\nnot an equal competition! First you sneak Potter into\\n \\nthe tournament, though he is underage! Now one of\\nyour Ministry friends attempts to put my champion\\nout of action! I smell double-dealing and corruption in\\nthis whole affair, and you, Dumbledore, you, with\\nyour talk of closer international wizarding links, of\\nrebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences —\\nhere’s what I think of you!”\\nKarkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore’s feet.\\nIn one swift movement, Hagrid seized the front of\\nKarkaroff’s furs, lifted him into the air, and slammed\\nhim against a nearby tree.\\n“Apologize!” Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for\\nbreath, Hagrid’s massive fist at his throat, his feet\\ndangling in midair.\\n“Hagrid, no\\\\” Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.\\nHagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the\\ntree, and Karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk\\nand slumped in a huddle at its roots; a few twigs and\\nleaves showered down upon his head.\\n“Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid,”\\nsaid Dumbledore sharply.\\nBreathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering\\nlook.\\n“Maybe I’d better stay here, Headmaster. ...”\\n“You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid,”\\nDumbledore repeated firmly. “Take him right up to\\nGryffindor Tower. And Harry — I want you to stay\\nthere. Anything you might want to do — any owls you\\nmight want to send — they can wait until morning, do\\nyou understand me?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Er — yes,” said Harry, staring at him. How had\\nDumbledore known that, at that very moment, he had\\nbeen thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to\\nSirius, to tell him what had happened?\\n“Ill leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster,” Hagrid said,\\nstaring menacingly at Karkaroff, who was still\\nsprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and\\ntree roots. “Stay, Fang. C’mon, Harry.”\\nThey marched in silence past the Beauxbatons\\ncarriage and up toward the castle.\\n“How dare he,” Hagrid growled as they strode past the\\nlake. “How dare he accuse Dumbledore. Like\\nDumbledore ’d do anythin’ like that. Like Dumbledore\\nwanted you in the tournament in the firs’ place.\\nWorried! I dunno when I seen Dumbledore more\\nworried than he’s bin lately. An’ you!” Hagrid\\nsuddenly said angrily to Harry, who looked up at him,\\ntaken aback. “What were yeh doin’, wanderin’ off with\\nruddy Krum? He’s from Durmstrang, Harry! Coulda\\njinxed yeh right there, couldn’ he? Hasn’ Moody\\ntaught yeh nothin’? ’Magine lettin’ him lure yeh off on\\nyer own — ”\\n“Krum’s all right!” said Harry as they climbed the\\nsteps into the entrance hall. “He wasn’t trying to jinx\\nme, he just wanted to talk about Hermione — ”\\n“I’ll be havin’ a few words with her, an’ all,” said\\nHagrid grimly, stomping up the stairs. “The less you\\nlot ’ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh’ll\\nbe. Yeh can’ trust any of ’em.”\\n“You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime,”\\nHarry said, annoyed.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Don’ you talk ter me abou’ her!” said Hagrid, and he\\nlooked quite frightening for a moment. “I’ve got her\\nnumber now! Tryin’ ter get back in me good books,\\ntryin’ ter get me ter tell her what’s cornin’ in the third\\ntask. Ha! You can’ trust any of ’em!”\\nHagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad\\nto say good-bye to him in front of the Fat Lady. He\\nclambered through the portrait hole into the common\\nroom and hurried straight for the corner where Ron\\nand Hermione were sitting, to tell them what had\\nhappened.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nz?\\nTHE DREAM\\n“It comes down to this,” said Hermione, rubbing her\\nforehead. “Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or\\nsomebody else attacked both of them when Viktor\\nwasn’t looking.”\\n“It must’ve been Crouch,” said Ron at once. “That’s\\nwhy he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got\\nthere. He’d done a runner.”\\n“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shaking his head. “He\\nseemed really weak — I don’t reckon he was up to\\nDisapparating or anything.”\\n“You can’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds,\\nhaven’t I told you enough times?” said Hermione.\\n“Okay ... how’s this for a theory,” said Ron excitedly.\\n“Krum attacked Crouch — no, wait for it — and then\\nStunned himself!”\\n“And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?” said Hermione\\ncoldly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Oh yeah ...”\\nIt was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept\\nout of their dormitories very early and hurried up to\\nthe Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they\\nwere standing looking out at the misty grounds. All\\nthree of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they\\nhad been talking late into the night about Mr.\\nCrouch.\\n“Just go through it again, Harry,” said Hermione.\\n“What did Mr. Crouch actually say?”\\n“I’ve told you, he wasn’t making much sense,” said\\nHarry. “He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about\\nsomething. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins,\\nand he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying\\nstuff was his fault. ... He mentioned his son.”\\n“Well, that was his fault,” said Hermione testily.\\n“He was out of his mind,” said Harry. “Half the time\\nhe seemed to think his wife and son were still alive,\\nand he kept talking to Percy about work and giving\\nhim instructions.”\\n“And ... remind me what he said about You-Know-\\nWho?” said Ron tentatively.\\n“I’ve told you,” Harry repeated dully. “He said he’s\\ngetting stronger.”\\nThere was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely\\nconfident voice, “But he was out of his mind, like you\\nsaid, so half of it was probably just raving. ...”\\n“He was sanest when he was trying to talk about\\nVoldemort,” said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound\\nof the name. “He was having real trouble stringing\\n \\ntwo words together, but that was when he seemed to\\nknow where he was, and know what he wanted to do.\\nHe just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.”\\nHarry turned away from the window and stared up\\ninto the rafters. The many perches were half-empty;\\nevery now and then, another owl would swoop in\\nthrough one of the windows, returning from its night’s\\nhunting with a mouse in its beak.\\n“If Snape hadn’t held me up,” Harry said bitterly, “we\\nmight’ve got there in time. The headmaster is busy,\\nPotter ... what’s this rubbish, Potter?’ Why couldn’t he\\nhave just got out of the way?”\\n“Maybe he didn’t want you to get there!” said Ron\\nquickly. “Maybe — hang on — how fast d’you reckon\\nhe could’ve gotten down to the forest? D’you reckon\\nhe could’ve beaten you and Dumbledore there?”\\n“Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or\\nsomething,” said Harry.\\n“Wouldn’t put it past him,” Ron muttered.\\n“We need to see Professor Moody,” said Hermione.\\n“We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch.”\\n“If he had the Marauder’s Map on him, it would’ve\\nbeen easy,” said Harry.\\n“Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,”\\nsaid Ron, “because it only shows up to the\\nboundaries, doesn’t — ”\\n“Shh!” said Hermione suddenly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nSomebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery.\\nHarry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer\\nand closer.\\n“ — that’s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of\\ntrouble for that — ”\\n“ — we’ve tried being polite; it’s time to play dirty, like\\nhim. He wouldn’t like the Ministry of Magic knowing\\nwhat he did — ”\\n“I’m telling you, if you put that in writing, it’s\\nblackmail!”\\n“Yeah, and you won’t be complaining if we get a nice\\nfat payoff, will you?”\\nThe Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came\\nover the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione.\\n“What’re you doing here?” Ron and Fred said at the\\nsame time.\\n“Sending a letter,” said Harry and George in unison.\\n“What, at this time?” said Hermione and Fred.\\nFred grinned.\\n“Fine — we won’t ask you what you’re doing, if you\\ndon’t ask us,” he said.\\nHe was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry\\nglanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on\\npurpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was\\ncovered.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Well, don’t let us hold you up,” Fred said, making a\\nmock bow and pointing at the door.\\nRon didn’t move. “Who’re you blackmailing?” he said.\\nThe grin vanished from Fred’s face. Harry saw George\\nhalf glance at Fred, before smiling at Ron.\\n“Don’t be stupid, I was only joking,” he said easily.\\n“Didn’t sound like that,” said Ron.\\nFred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said\\nabruptly, “I’ve told you before, Ron, keep your nose\\nout if you like it the shape it is. Can’t see why you\\nwould, but — ”\\n“It’s my business if you’re blackmailing someone,”\\nsaid Ron. “George’s right, you could end up in serious\\ntrouble for that.”\\n“Told you, I was joking,” said George. He walked over\\nto Fred, pulled the letter out of his hands, and began\\nattaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl. “You’re\\nstarting to sound a bit like our dear older brother,\\nyou are, Ron. Carry on like this and you’ll be made a\\nprefect.”\\n“No, I won’t!” said Ron hotly.\\nGeorge carried the barn owl over to the window and it\\ntook off. George turned around and grinned at Ron.\\n“Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you\\nlater.”\\nHe and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione stared at one another.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You don’t think they know something about all this,\\ndo you?” Hermione whispered. “About Crouch and\\neverything?”\\n“No,” said Harry. “If it was something that serious,\\nthey’d tell someone. They’d tell Dumbledore.”\\nRon, however, was looking uncomfortable.\\n“What’s the matter?” Hermione asked him.\\n“Well ...” said Ron slowly, “I dunno if they would.\\nThey’re ... they’re obsessed with making money lately,\\nI noticed it when I was hanging around with them —\\nwhen — you know — ”\\n“We weren’t talking.” Harry finished the sentence for\\nhim. “Yeah, but blackmail ...”\\n“It’s this joke shop idea they’ve got,” said Ron. “I\\nthought they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but\\nthey really mean it, they want to start one. They’ve\\nonly got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on\\nabout how it’s time to think about their future, and\\nDad can’t help them, and they need gold to get\\nstarted.”\\nHermione was looking uncomfortable now.\\n“Yes, but ... they wouldn’t do anything against the law\\nto get gold.”\\n“Wouldn’t they?” said Ron, looking skeptical. “I dunno\\n... they don’t exactly mind breaking rules, do they?”\\n“Yes, but this is the law,” said Hermione, looking\\nscared. “This isn’t some silly school rule. ... They’ll get\\na lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron ... maybe\\nyou’d better tell Percy. ...”\\n \\n“Are you mad?” said Ron. “Tell Percy? He’d probably\\ndo a Crouch and turn them in.” He stared at the\\nwindow through which Fred and Georges owl had\\ndeparted, then said, “Come on, let’s get some\\nbreakfast.”\\n“D’you think it’s too early to go and see Professor\\nMoody?” Hermione said as they went down the spiral\\nstaircase.\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “He’d probably blast us through the\\ndoor if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he’ll think\\nwe’re trying to attack him while he’s asleep. Let’s give\\nit till break.”\\nHistory of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept\\nchecking Ron’s watch, having finally discarded his\\nown, but Ron’s was moving so slowly he could have\\nsworn it had stopped working too. All three of them\\nwere so tired they could happily have put their heads\\ndown on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn’t\\ntaking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head\\non her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes\\nout of focus.\\nWhen the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the\\ncorridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found\\nProfessor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they\\nfelt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving\\nhis face an even more lopsided appearance than\\nusual.\\n“Professor Moody?” Harry called as they made their\\nway toward him through the crowd.\\n“Hello, Potter,” growled Moody. His magical eye\\nfollowed a couple of passing first years, who sped up,\\nlooking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody’s\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nhead and watched them around the corner before he\\nspoke again.\\n“Come in here.”\\nHe stood back to let them into his empty classroom,\\nlimped in after them, and closed the door.\\n“Did you find him?” Harry asked without preamble.\\n“Mr. Crouch?”\\n“No,” said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat\\ndown, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight\\ngroan, and pulled out his hip flask.\\n“Did you use the map?” Harry said.\\n“Of course,” said Moody, taking a swig from his flask.\\n“Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it\\nfrom my office into the forest. He wasn’t anywhere on\\nthere.”\\n“So he did Disapparate?” said Ron.\\n“You can’t Disapparate on the grounds, Ron\\\\” said\\nHermione. “There are other ways he could have\\ndisappeared, aren’t there, Professor?”\\nMoody’s magical eye quivered as it rested on\\nHermione. “You’re another one who might think about\\na career as an Auror,” he told her. “Mind works the\\nright way, Granger.”\\nHermione flushed pink with pleasure.\\n“Well, he wasn’t invisible,” said Harry. “The map\\nshows invisible people. He must’ve left the grounds,\\nthen.”\\n \\n“But under his own steam?” said Hermione eagerly,\\n“or because someone made him?”\\n“Yeah, someone could’ve — could’ve pulled him onto a\\nbroom and flown off with him, couldn’t they?” said\\nRon quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too\\nwanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.\\n“We can’t rule out kidnap,” growled Moody.\\n“So,” said Ron, “d’you reckon he’s somewhere in\\nHogsmeade?”\\n“Could be anywhere,” said Moody, shaking his head.\\n“Only thing we know for sure is that he’s not here.”\\nHe yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and\\nhis lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing\\nteeth. Then he said, “Now, Dumbledore’s told me you\\nthree fancy yourselves as investigators, but there’s\\nnothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry’ll be\\nlooking for him now, Dumbledore’s notified them.\\nPotter, you just keep your mind on the third task.”\\n“What?” said Harry. “Oh yeah ...”\\nHe hadn’t given the maze a single thought since he’d\\nleft it with Krum the previous night.\\n“Should be right up your street, this one,” said\\nMoody, looking up at Harry and scratching his\\nscarred and stubbly chin. “From what Dumbledore’s\\nsaid, you’ve managed to get through stuff like this\\nplenty of times. Broke your way through a series of\\nobstacles guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone in your first\\nyear, didn’t you?”\\n“We helped,” Ron said quickly. “Me and Hermione\\nhelped.”\\n \\nMoody grinned.\\n“Well, help him practice for this one, and I’ll be very\\nsurprised if he doesn’t win,” said Moody. “In the\\nmeantime ... constant vigilance, Potter. Constant\\nvigilance.” He took another long draw from his hip\\nflask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window.\\nThe topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible\\nthrough it.\\n“You two,” counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron\\nand Hermione, “you stick close to Potter, all right? I’m\\nkeeping an eye on things, but all the same ... you can\\nnever have too many eyes out.”\\n•k k k\\nSirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It\\nfluttered down beside Harry at the same moment that\\na tawny owl landed in front of Hermione, clutching a\\ncopy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took the\\nnewspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, “Ha!\\nShe hasn’t got wind of Crouch!” then joined Ron and\\nHarry in reading what Sirius had to say on the\\nmysterious events of the night before last.\\nHarry — what do you think you are playing at,\\nwalking off into the forest with Viktor Krum? I want\\nyou to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to\\ngo walking with anyone else at night. There is\\nsomebody highly dangerous at Hogwarts. It is clear to\\nme that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing\\nDumbledore and you were probably feet away from\\nthem in the dark. You could have been killed.\\nYour name didn’t get into the Goblet of Fire by\\naccident. If someone’s trying to attack you, they’re on\\n \\ntheir last chance. Stay close to Ron and Hermione, do\\nnot leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm\\nyourself for the third task. Practice Stunning and\\nDisarming. A few hexes wouldn’t go amiss either.\\nThere’s nothing you can do about Crouch. Keep your\\nhead down and look after yourself. I’m waiting for your\\nletter giving me your word you won’t stray out-of-\\nbounds again.\\nSirius\\n“Who’s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?”\\nsaid Harry in mild indignation as he folded up Sirius’s\\nletter and put it inside his robes. “After all the stuff he\\ndid at school!”\\n“He’s worried about you!” said Hermione sharply.\\n“Just like Moody and Hagrid! So listen to them!”\\n“No one’s tried to attack me all year,” said Harry. “No\\none’s done anything to me at all — ”\\n“Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,” said\\nHermione. “And they must’ve done that for a reason,\\nHarry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they’ve been biding\\ntheir time. Maybe this is the task they’re going to get\\nyou.”\\n“Look,” said Harry impatiently, “let’s say Sirius is\\nright, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch.\\nWell, they would’ve been in the trees near us,\\nwouldn’t they? But they waited till I was out of the\\nway until they acted, didn’t they? So it doesn’t look\\nlike I’m their target, does it?”\\n“They couldn’t have made it look like an accident if\\nthey’d murdered you in the forest!” said Hermione.\\n“But if you die during a task — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“They didn’t care about attacking Krum, did they?”\\nsaid Harry. “Why didn’t they just polish me off at the\\nsame time? They could’ve made it look like Krum and\\nI had a duel or something.”\\n“Harry, I don’t understand it either,” said Hermione\\ndesperately. “I just know there are a lot of odd things\\ngoing on, and I don’t like it. ... Moody’s right — Sirius\\nis right — you’ve got to get in training for the third\\ntask, straight away. And you make sure you write\\nback to Sirius and promise him you’re not going to go\\nsneaking off alone again.”\\nThe Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting\\nthan when Harry had to stay indoors. For the next\\nfew days he spent all of his free time either in the\\nlibrary with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or\\nelse in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to\\npractice. Harry was concentrating on the Stunning\\nSpell, which he had never used before. The trouble\\nwas that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on\\nRon’s and Hermione ’s part.\\n“Can’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris?” Ron suggested on\\nMonday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the\\nmiddle of their Charms classroom, having just been\\nStunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a\\nrow. “Let’s Stun her for a bit. Or you could use\\nDobby, Harry, I bet he’d do anything to help you. I’m\\nnot complaining or anything” — he got gingerly to his\\nfeet, rubbing his backside — “but I’m aching all over.\\n“Well, you keep missing the cushions, don’t you!” said\\nHermione impatiently, rearranging the pile of\\ncushions they had used for the Banishing Spell,\\nwhich Flitwick had left in a cabinet. “Just try and fall\\nbackward!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well,\\nHermione!” said Ron angrily. “Why don’t you take a\\nturn?”\\n“Well, I think Harry’s got it now, anyway,” said\\nHermione hastily. “And we don’t have to worry about\\nDisarming, because he’s been able to do that for ages.\\n... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes\\nthis evening.”\\nShe looked down the list they had made in the\\nlibrary.\\n“I like the look of this one,” she said, “this\\nImpediment Curse. Should slow down anything that’s\\ntrying to attack you, Harry. We’ll start with that one.”\\nThe bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back\\ninto Flitwick’s cupboard and slipped out of the\\nclassroom.\\n“See you at dinner!” said Hermione, and she set off for\\nArithmancy, while Harry and Ron headed toward\\nNorth Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of dazzling\\ngold sunlight fell across the corridor from the high\\nwindows. The sky outside was so brightly blue it\\nlooked as though it had been enameled.\\n“It’s going to be boiling in Trelawney’s room, she never\\nputs out that fire,” said Ron as they started up the\\nstaircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor.\\nHe was quite right. The dimly lit room was\\nswelteringly hot. The fumes from the perfumed fire\\nwere heavier than ever. Harry’s head swam as he\\nmade his way over to one of the curtained windows.\\nWhile Professor Trelawney was looking the other way,\\ndisentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an\\ninch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so\\n \\nthat a soft breeze played across his face. It was\\nextremely comfortable.\\n“My dears,” said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in\\nher winged armchair in front of the class and peering\\naround at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes,\\n“we have almost finished our work on planetary\\ndivination. Today, however, will be an excellent\\nopportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he is\\nplaced most interestingly at the present time. If you\\nwill all look this way, I will dim the lights. ...”\\nShe waved her wand and the lamps went out. The fire\\nwas the only source of light now. Professor Trelawney\\nbent down and lifted, from under her chair, a\\nminiature model of the solar system, contained within\\na glass dome. It was a beautiful thing; each of the\\nmoons glimmered in place around the nine planets\\nand the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air\\nbeneath the glass. Harry watched lazily as Professor\\nTrelawney began to point out the fascinating angle\\nMars was making to Neptune. The heavily perfumed\\nfumes washed over him, and the breeze from the\\nwindow played across his face. He could hear an\\ninsect humming gently somewhere behind the\\ncurtain. His eyelids began to droop. ...\\nHe was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring\\nthrough the clear blue sky toward an old, ivy-covered\\nhouse set high on a hillside. Lower and lower they\\nflew, the wind blowing pleasantly in Harry’s face, until\\nthey reached a dark and broken window in the upper\\nstory of the house and entered. Now they were flying\\nalong a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end\\n. . . through the door they went, into a dark room\\nwhose windows were boarded up. ...\\nHarry had left the owl’s back ... he was watching,\\nnow, as it fluttered across the room, into a chair with\\n \\nits back to him. ... There were two dark shapes on the\\nfloor beside the chair . . . both of them were stirring. . . .\\nOne was a huge snake . . . the other was a man ... a\\nshort, balding man, a man with watery eyes and a\\npointed nose ... he was wheezing and sobbing on the\\nhearth rug. . . .\\n“You are in luck, Wormtail,” said a cold, high-pitched\\nvoice from the depths of the chair in which the owl\\nhad landed. “You are very fortunate indeed. Your\\nblunder has not ruined everything. He is dead.”\\n“My Lord!” gasped the man on the floor. “My Lord, I\\nam ... 1 am so pleased ... and so sorry. ...”\\n“Nagini,” said the cold voice, “you are out of luck. 1\\nwill not be feeding Wormtail to you, after all ... but\\nnever mind, never mind . . . there is still Harry Potter.\\nThe snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue\\nfluttering.\\n“Now, Wormtail,” said the cold voice, “perhaps one\\nmore little reminder why I will not tolerate another\\nblunder from you. ...”\\n“My Lord ... no ... I beg you ...”\\nThe tip of a wand emerged from around the back of\\nthe chair, ft was pointing at Wormtail.\\n“Crucio\\\\” said the cold voice.\\nWormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve\\nin his body were on fire, the screaming filled Harry’s\\nears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nwas yelling too. ... Voldemort would hear him, would\\nknow he was there. ...\\n“Harry! Harry\\\\”\\nHarry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of\\nProfessor Trelawney’s room with his hands over his\\nface. His scar was still burning so badly that his eyes\\nwere watering. The pain had been real. The whole\\nclass was standing around him, and Ron was\\nkneeling next to him, looking terrified.\\n“You all right?” he said.\\n“Of course he isn’t!” said Professor Trelawney, looking\\nthoroughly excited. Her great eyes loomed over Harry,\\ngazing at him. “What was it, Potter? A premonition?\\nAn apparition? What did you see?”\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself\\nshaking. He couldn’t stop himself from looking\\naround, into the shadows behind him; Voldemort’s\\nvoice had sounded so close. ...\\n“You were clutching your scar!” said Professor\\nTrelawney. “You were rolling on the floor, clutching\\nyour scar! Come now, Potter, I have experience in\\nthese matters!”\\nHarry looked up at her.\\n“I need to go to the hospital wing, I think,” he said.\\n“Bad headache.”\\n“My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the\\nextraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!” said\\nProfessor Trelawney “If you leave now, you may lose\\nthe opportunity to see further than you have ever — ”\\n \\n“I don’t want to see anything except a headache cure,”\\nsaid Harry.\\nHe stood up. The class backed away. They all looked\\nunnerved.\\n“See you later,” Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked\\nup his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring\\nProfessor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression\\nof great frustration, as though she had just been\\ndenied a real treat.\\nWhen Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder,\\nhowever, he did not set off for the hospital wing. He\\nhad no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius\\nhad told him what to do if his scar hurt him again,\\nand Harry was going to follow his advice: He was\\ngoing straight to Dumbledore’s office. He marched\\ndown the corridors, thinking about what he had seen\\nin the dream ... it had been as vivid as the one that\\nhad awoken him on Privet Drive. ... He ran over the\\ndetails in his mind, trying to make sure he could\\nremember them. ... He had heard Voldemort accusing\\nWormtail of making a blunder ... but the owl had\\nbrought good news, the blunder had been repaired,\\nsomebody was dead ... so Wormtail was not going to\\nbe fed to the snake ... he, Harry, was going to be fed\\nto it instead. ...\\nHarry had walked right past the stone gargoyle\\nguarding the entrance to Dumbledore’s office without\\nnoticing. He blinked, looked around, realized what he\\nhad done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of\\nit. Then he remembered that he didn’t know the\\npassword.\\n“Sherbet lemon?” he tried tentatively.\\nThe gargoyle did not move.\\n \\n“Okay,” said Harry, staring at it, “Pear Drop. Er —\\nLicorice Wand. Fizzing Whizbee. Drooble’s Best\\nBlowing Gum. Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans ... oh\\nno, he doesn’t like them, does he? ... oh just open,\\ncan’t you?” he said angrily. “I really need to see him,\\nit’s urgent!”\\nThe gargoyle remained immovable.\\nHarry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating\\npain in his big toe.\\n“Chocolate Frog!” he yelled angrily, standing on one\\nleg. “Sugar Quill! Cockroach Cluster!”\\nThe gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry\\nblinked.\\n“Cockroach Cluster?” he said, amazed. “I was only\\njoking. ...”\\nHe hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped\\nonto the foot of a spiral stone staircase, which moved\\nslowly upward as the doors closed behind him, taking\\nhim up to a polished oak door with a brass door\\nknocker.\\nHe could hear voices from inside the office. He\\nstepped off the moving staircase and hesitated,\\nlistening.\\n“Dumbledore, I’m afraid I don’t see the connection,\\ndon’t see it at all!” It was the voice of the Minister of\\nMagic, Cornelius Fudge. “Ludo says Bertha’s perfectly\\ncapable of getting herself lost. I agree we would have\\nexpected to have found her by now, but all the same,\\nwe’ve no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at\\nall. As for her disappearance being linked with Barty\\nCrouch’s!”\\n \\n“And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch,\\nMinister?” said Moody’s growling voice.\\n“I see two possibilities, Alastor,” said Fudge. “Either\\nCrouch has finally cracked — more than likely, I’m\\nsure you’ll agree, given his personal history — lost his\\nmind, and gone wandering off somewhere — ”\\n“He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case,\\nCornelius,” said Dumbledore calmly.\\n“Or else — well ...” Fudge sounded embarrassed.\\n“Well, I’ll reserve judgment until after I’ve seen the\\nplace where he was found, but you say it was just\\npast the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you\\nknow what that woman is?”\\n“I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and\\nan excellent dancer,” said Dumbledore quietly.\\n“Dumbledore, come!” said Fudge angrily. “Don’t you\\nthink you might be prejudiced in her favor because of\\nHagrid? They don’t all turn out harmless — if, indeed,\\nyou can call Hagrid harmless, with that monster\\nfixation he’s got — ”\\n“I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid,”\\nsaid Dumbledore, just as calmly. “I think it possible\\nthat it is you who are prejudiced, Cornelius.”\\n“Can we wrap up this discussion?” growled Moody.\\n“Yes, yes, let’s go down to the grounds, then,” said\\nFudge impatiently.\\n“No, it’s not that,” said Moody, “it’s just that Potter\\nwants a word with you, Dumbledore. He’s just outside\\nthe door.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE PENSIEVE\\nThe door of the office opened.\\n“Hello, Potter,” said Moody. “Come in, then.”\\nHarry walked inside. He had been inside\\nDumbledore’s office once before; it was a very\\nbeautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of\\nprevious headmasters and headmistresses of\\nHogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, their chests\\nrising and falling gently.\\nCornelius Fudge was standing beside Dumbledore’s\\ndesk, wearing his usual pinstriped cloak and holding\\nhis lime-green bowler hat.\\n“Harry!” said Fudge jovially, moving forward. “How are\\nyou?”\\n“Fine,” Harry lied.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“We were just talking about the night when Mr.\\nCrouch turned up on the grounds,” said Fudge. “It\\nwas you who found him, was it not?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry. Then, feeling it was pointless to\\npretend that he hadn’t overheard what they had been\\nsaying, he added, “I didn’t see Madame Maxime\\nanywhere, though, and she’d have a job hiding,\\nwouldn’t she?”\\nDumbledore smiled at Harry behind Fudge’s back, his\\neyes twinkling.\\n“Yes, well,” said Fudge, looking embarrassed, “we’re\\nabout to go for a short walk on the grounds, Harry, if\\nyou’ll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your\\nclass — ”\\n“I wanted to talk to you, Professor,” Harry said\\nquickly, looking at Dumbledore, who gave him a swift,\\nsearching look.\\n“Wait here for me, Harry,” he said. “Our examination\\nof the grounds will not take long.”\\nThey trooped out in silence past him and closed the\\ndoor. After a minute or so, Harry heard the clunks of\\nMoody’s wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor\\nbelow. He looked around.\\n“Hello, Fawkes,” he said.\\nFawkes, Professor Dumbledore’s phoenix, was\\nstanding on his golden perch beside the door. The\\nsize of a swan, with magnificent scarlet-and-gold\\nplumage, he swished his long tail and blinked\\nbenignly at Harry.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHarry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore’s\\ndesk. For several minutes, he sat and watched the old\\nheadmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their\\nframes, thinking about what he had just heard, and\\nrunning his fingers over his scar. It had stopped\\nhurting now.\\nHe felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in\\nDumbledore’s office, knowing he would shortly be\\ntelling him about the dream. Harry looked up at the\\nwalls behind the desk. The patched and ragged\\nSorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next\\nto it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies\\nset into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he\\nhimself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his\\nsecond year. The sword had once belonged to Godric\\nGryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing\\nat it, remembering how it had come to his aid when\\nhe had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a\\npatch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the\\nglass case. He looked around for the source of the\\nlight and saw a sliver of silver-white shining brightly\\nfrom within a black cabinet behind him, whose door\\nhad not been closed properly. Harry hesitated,\\nglanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the\\noffice, and pulled open the cabinet door.\\nA shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings\\naround the edge: runes and symbols that Harry did\\nnot recognize. The silvery light was coming from the\\nbasin’s contents, which were like nothing Harry had\\never seen before. He could not tell whether the\\nsubstance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish\\nsilver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it\\nbecame ruffled like water beneath wind, and then,\\nlike clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked\\nlike light made liquid — or like wind made solid —\\nHarry couldn’t make up his mind.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHe wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but\\nnearly four years’ experience of the magical world told\\nhim that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some\\nunknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He\\ntherefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his\\nrobes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked\\nback at the contents of the basin, and prodded them.\\nThe surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began\\nto swirl very fast.\\nHarry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet.\\nThe silvery substance had become transparent; it\\nlooked like glass. He looked down into it, expecting to\\nsee the stone bottom of the basin — and saw instead\\nan enormous room below the surface of the\\nmysterious substance, a room into which he seemed\\nto be looking through a circular window in the ceiling.\\nThe room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be\\nunderground, for there were no windows, merely\\ntorches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated\\nthe walls of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his\\nnose was a mere inch away from the glassy\\nsubstance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches\\nand wizards were seated around every wall on what\\nseemed to be benches rising in levels. An empty chair\\nstood in the very center of the room. There was\\nsomething about the chair that gave Harry an\\nominous feeling. Chains encircled the arms of it, as\\nthough its occupants were usually tied to it.\\nWhere was this place? It surely wasn’t Hogwarts; he\\nhad never seen a room like that here in the castle.\\nMoreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the\\nbottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and\\nHarry knew there were not nearly that many teachers\\nat Hogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be waiting\\nfor something; even though he could only see the tops\\n \\nof their hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing\\nin one direction, and none of them were talking to one\\nanother.\\nThe basin being circular, and the room he was\\nobserving square, Harry could not make out what was\\ngoing on in the corners of it. He leaned even closer,\\ntilting his head, trying to see . . .\\nThe tip of his nose touched the strange substance\\ninto which he was staring.\\nDumbledore’s office gave an almighty lurch — Harry\\nwas thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the\\nsubstance inside the basin —\\nBut his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was\\nfalling through something icy-cold and black; it was\\nlike being sucked into a dark whirlpool —\\nAnd suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench\\nat the end of the room inside the basin, a bench\\nraised high above the others. He looked up at the\\nhigh stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular\\nwindow through which he had just been staring, but\\nthere was nothing there but dark, solid stone.\\nBreathing hard and fast, Harry looked around him.\\nNot one of the witches and wizards in the room (and\\nthere were at least two hundred of them) was looking\\nat him. Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a\\nfourteen-year- old boy had just dropped from the\\nceiling into their midst. Harry turned to the wizard\\nnext to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of\\nsurprise that reverberated around the silent room.\\nHe was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Professor!” Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper.\\n“I’m sorry — I didn’t mean to — I was just looking at\\nthat basin in your cabinet — I — where are we?”\\nBut Dumbledore didn’t move or speak. He ignored\\nHarry completely. Like every other wizard on the\\nbenches, he was staring into the far corner of the\\nroom, where there was a door.\\nHarry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then\\naround at the silently watchful crowd, then back at\\nDumbledore. And then it dawned on him. ...\\nOnce before, Harry had found himself somewhere that\\nnobody could see or hear him. That time, he had\\nfallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right\\ninto somebody else’s memory ... and unless he was\\nvery much mistaken, something of the sort had\\nhappened again. ...\\nHarry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then\\nwaved it energetically in front of Dumbledore ’s face.\\nDumbledore did not blink, look around at Harry, or\\nindeed move at all. And that, in Harry’s opinion,\\nsettled the matter. Dumbledore wouldn’t ignore him\\nlike that. He was inside a memory, and this was not\\nthe present-day Dumbledore. Yet it couldn’t be that\\nlong ago . . . the Dumbledore sitting next to him now\\nwas silver-haired, just like the present-day\\nDumbledore. But what was this place? What were all\\nthese wizards waiting for?\\nHarry looked around more carefully. The room, as he\\nhad suspected when observing it from above, was\\nalmost certainly underground — more of a dungeon\\nthan a room, he thought. There was a bleak and\\nforbidding air about the place; there were no pictures\\non the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried\\nrows of benches, rising in levels all around the room,\\n \\nall positioned so that they had a clear view of that\\nchair with the chains on its arms.\\nBefore Harry could reach any conclusions about the\\nplace in which they were, he heard footsteps. The\\ndoor in the corner of the dungeon opened and three\\npeople entered — or at least one man, flanked by two\\ndementors.\\nHarry’s insides went cold. The dementors — tall,\\nhooded creatures whose faces were concealed — were\\ngliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the\\nroom, each grasping one of the man’s arms with their\\ndead and rotten-looking hands. The man between\\nthem looked as though he was about to faint, and\\nHarry couldn’t blame him ... he knew the dementors\\ncould not touch him inside a memory, but he\\nremembered their power only too well. The watching\\ncrowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the\\nman in the chained chair and glided back out of the\\nroom. The door swung shut behind them.\\nHarry looked down at the man now sitting in the\\nchair and saw that it was Karkaroff.\\nUnlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger;\\nhis hair and goatee were black. He was not dressed in\\nsleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes. He was\\nshaking. Even as Harry watched, the chains on the\\narms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked\\ntheir way up Karkaroff’s arms, binding him there.\\n“Igor Karkaroff,” said a curt voice to Harry’s left.\\nHarry looked around and saw Mr. Crouch standing\\nup in the middle of the bench beside him. Crouch’s\\nhair was dark, his face was much less lined, he\\nlooked fit and alert. “You have been brought from\\nAzkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nYou have given us to understand that you have\\nimportant information for us.”\\nKarkaroff straightened himself as best he could,\\ntightly bound to the chair.\\n“I have, sir,” he said, and although his voice was very\\nscared, Harry could still hear the familiar unctuous\\nnote in it. “I wish to be of use to the Ministry. I wish\\nto help. I — I know that the Ministry is trying to — to\\nround up the last of the Dark Lord’s supporters. I am\\neager to assist in any way I can. ...”\\nThere was a murmur around the benches. Some of\\nthe wizards and witches were surveying Karkaroff\\nwith interest, others with pronounced mistrust. Then\\nHarry heard, quite distinctly, from Dumbledore’s\\nother side, a familiar, growling voice saying, “Filth.”\\nHarry leaned forward so that he could see past\\nDumbledore. Mad-Eye Moody was sitting there —\\nexcept that there was a very noticeable difference in\\nhis appearance. He did not have his magical eye, but\\ntwo normal ones. Both were looking down upon\\nKarkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike.\\n“Crouch is going to let him out,” Moody breathed\\nquietly to Dumbledore. “He’s done a deal with him.\\nTook me six months to track him down, and Crouch\\nis going to let him go if he’s got enough new names.\\nLet’s hear his information, I say, and throw him\\nstraight back to the dementors.”\\nDumbledore made a small noise of dissent through\\nhis long, crooked nose.\\n“Ah, I was forgetting ... you don’t like the dementors,\\ndo you, Albus?” said Moody with a sardonic smile.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“No,” said Dumbledore calmly, “I’m afraid I don’t. I\\nhave long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with\\nsuch creatures.”\\n“But for filth like this ...” Moody said softly.\\n“You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,” said Mr.\\nCrouch. “Let us hear them, please.”\\n“You must understand,” said Karkaroff hurriedly,\\n“that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named operated always in\\nthe greatest secrecy. . . . He preferred that we — I\\nmean to say, his supporters — and I regret now, very\\ndeeply, that I ever counted myself among them — ”\\n“Get on with it,” sneered Moody.\\n“ — we never knew the names of every one of our\\nfellows — He alone knew exactly who we all were — ”\\n“Which was a wise move, wasn’t it, as it prevented\\nsomeone like you, Karkaroff, from turning all of them\\nin,” muttered Moody.\\n“Yet you say you have some names for us?” said Mr.\\nCrouch.\\n“I — I do,” said Karkaroff breathlessly. “And these\\nwere important supporters, mark you. People I saw\\nwith my own eyes doing his bidding. I give this\\ninformation as a sign that I fully and totally renounce\\nhim, and am filled with a remorse so deep I can\\nbarely — ”\\n“These names are?” said Mr. Crouch sharply.\\nKarkaroff drew a deep breath.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“There was Antonin Dolohov,” he said. “I — I saw him\\ntorture countless Muggles and — and non-supporters\\nof the Dark Lord.”\\n“And helped him do it,” murmured Moody.\\n“We have already apprehended Dolohov,” said\\nCrouch. “He was caught shortly after yourself.”\\n“Indeed?” said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. “I — I am\\ndelighted to hear it!”\\nBut he didn’t look it. Harry could tell that this news\\nhad come as a real blow to him. One of his names\\nwas worthless.\\n“Any others?” said Crouch coldly.\\n“Why, yes ... there was Rosier,” said Karkaroff\\nhurriedly. “Evan Rosier.”\\n“Rosier is dead,” said Crouch. “He was caught shortly\\nafter you were too. He preferred to fight rather than\\ncome quietly and was killed in the struggle.”\\n“Took a bit of me with him, though,” whispered\\nMoody to Harry’s right. Harry looked around at him\\nonce more, and saw him indicating the large chunk\\nout of his nose to Dumbledore.\\n“No — no more than Rosier deserved!” said Karkaroff,\\na real note of panic in his voice now. Harry could see\\nthat he was starting to worry that none of his\\ninformation would be of any use to the Ministry.\\nKarkaroff’s eyes darted toward the door in the corner,\\nbehind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood,\\nwaiting.\\n“Any more?” said Crouch.\\n \\n“Yes!” said Karkaroff. “There was Travers — he helped\\nmurder the McKinnons! Mulciber — he specialized in\\nthe Imperius Curse, forced countless people to do\\nhorrific things! Rookwood, who was a spy, and passed\\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named useful information from\\ninside the Ministry itself!”\\nHarry could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck\\ngold. The watching crowd was all murmuring\\ntogether.\\n“Rookwood?” said Mr. Crouch, nodding to a witch\\nsitting in front of him, who began scribbling upon her\\npiece of parchment. “Augustus Rookwood of the\\nDepartment of Mysteries?”\\n“The very same,” said Karkaroff eagerly. “I believe he\\nused a network of well-placed wizards, both inside the\\nMinistry and out, to collect information — ”\\n“But Travers and Mulciber we have,” said Mr. Crouch.\\n“Very well, Karkaroff, if that is all, you will be\\nreturned to Azkaban while we decide — ”\\n“Not yet!” cried Karkaroff, looking quite desperate.\\n“Wait, I have more!”\\nHarry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his\\nwhite skin contrasting strongly with the black of his\\nhair and beard.\\n“Snape!” he shouted. “Severus Snape!”\\n“Snape has been cleared by this council,” said Crouch\\ndisdainfully. “He has been vouched for by Albus\\nDumbledore.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“No!” shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that\\nbound him to the chair. “I assure you! Severus Snape\\nis a Death Eater!”\\nDumbledore had gotten to his feet.\\n“I have given evidence already on this matter,” he said\\ncalmly. “Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater.\\nHowever, he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort’s\\ndownfall and turned spy for us, at great personal risk.\\nHe is now no more a Death Eater than I am.”\\nHarry turned to look at Mad-Eye Moody. He was\\nwearing a look of deep skepticism behind\\nDumbledore ’s back.\\n“Very well, Karkaroff,” Crouch said coldly, “you have\\nbeen of assistance. I shall review your case. You will\\nreturn to Azkaban in the meantime. ...”\\nMr. Crouch’s voice faded. Harry looked around; the\\ndungeon was dissolving as though it were made of\\nsmoke; everything was fading; he could see only his\\nown body — all else was swirling darkness. ...\\nAnd then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in\\na different seat, still on the highest bench, but now to\\nthe left side of Mr. Crouch. The atmosphere seemed\\nquite different: relaxed, even cheerful. The witches\\nand wizards all around the walls were talking to one\\nanother, almost as though they were at some sort of\\nsporting event. Harry noticed a witch halfway up the\\nrows of benches opposite. She had short blonde hair,\\nwas wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end\\nof an acid-green quill. It was, unmistakably, a\\nyounger Rita Skeeter. Harry looked around;\\nDumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing\\ndifferent robes. Mr. Crouch looked more tired and\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nsomehow fiercer, gaunter. ... Harry understood. It was\\na different memory, a different day ... a different trial.\\nThe door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman\\nwalked into the room.\\nThis was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed,\\nbut a Ludo Bagman who was clearly at the height of\\nhis Quidditch-playing fitness. His nose wasn’t broken\\nnow; he was tall and lean and muscular. Bagman\\nlooked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair,\\nbut it did not bind him there as it had bound\\nKarkaroff, and Bagman, perhaps taking heart from\\nthis, glanced around at the watching crowd, waved at\\na couple of them, and managed a small smile.\\n“Ludo Bagman, you have been brought here in front\\nof the Council of Magical Law to answer charges\\nrelating to the activities of the Death Eaters,” said Mr.\\nCrouch. “We have heard the evidence against you,\\nand are about to reach our verdict. Do you have\\nanything to add to your testimony before we\\npronounce judgment?”\\nHarry couldn’t believe his ears. Ludo Bagman, a\\nDeath Eater?\\n“Only,” said Bagman, smiling awkwardly, “well — I\\nknow I’ve been a bit of an idiot — ”\\nOne or two wizards and witches in the surrounding\\nseats smiled indulgently. Mr. Crouch did not appear\\nto share their feelings. He was staring down at Ludo\\nBagman with an expression of the utmost severity\\nand dislike.\\n“You never spoke a truer word, boy,” someone\\nmuttered dryly to Dumbledore behind Harry. He\\nlooked around and saw Moody sitting there again. “If I\\n \\ndidn’t know he’d always been dim, I’d have said some\\nof those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain.\\n“Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing\\ninformation to Lord Voldemort’s supporters,” said Mr.\\nCrouch. “For this, I suggest a term of imprisonment\\nin Azkaban lasting no less than — ”\\nBut there was an angry outcry from the surrounding\\nbenches. Several of the witches and wizards around\\nthe walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even\\ntheir fists, at Mr. Crouch.\\n“But I’ve told you, I had no idea!” Bagman called\\nearnestly over the crowd’s babble, his round blue eyes\\nwidening. “None at all! Old Rookwood was a friend of\\nmy dad’s ... never crossed my mind he was in with\\nYou-Know-Who! I thought I was collecting information\\nfor our side! And Rookwood kept talking about getting\\nme a job in the Ministry later on ... once my\\nQuidditch days are over, you know ... I mean, I can’t\\nkeep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life,\\ncan I?”\\nThere were titters from the crowd.\\n“It will be put to the vote,” said Mr. Crouch coldly. He\\nturned to the right-hand side of the dungeon. “The\\njury will please raise their hands ... those in favor of\\nimprisonment ...”\\nHarry looked toward the right-hand side of the\\ndungeon. Not one person raised their hand. Many of\\nthe witches and wizards around the walls began to\\nclap. One of the witches on the jury stood up.\\n“Yes?” barked Crouch.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“We’d just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his\\nsplendid performance for England in the Quidditch\\nmatch against Turkey last Saturday,” the witch said\\nbreathlessly.\\nMr. Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing\\nwith applause now. Bagman got to his feet and\\nbowed, beaming.\\n“Despicable,” Mr. Crouch spat at Dumbledore, sitting\\ndown as Bagman walked out of the dungeon.\\n“Rookwood get him a job indeed. ... The day Ludo\\nBagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the\\nMinistry. ...”\\nAnd the dungeon dissolved again. When it had\\nreturned, Harry looked around. He and Dumbledore\\nwere still sitting beside Mr. Crouch, but the\\natmosphere could not have been more different. There\\nwas total silence, broken only by the dry sobs of a\\nfrail, wispy-looking witch in the seat next to Mr.\\nCrouch. She was clutching a handkerchief to her\\nmouth with trembling hands. Harry looked up at\\nCrouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer\\nthan ever before. A nerve was twitching in his temple.\\n“Bring them in,” he said, and his voice echoed\\nthrough the silent dungeon.\\nThe door in the corner opened yet again. Six\\ndementors entered this time, flanking a group of four\\npeople. Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to\\nlook up at Mr. Crouch. A few of them whispered to\\none another.\\nThe dementors placed each of the four people in the\\nfour chairs with chained arms that now stood on the\\ndungeon floor. There was a thickset man who stared\\nblankly up at Crouch; a thinner and more nervous-\\n \\nlooking man, whose eyes were darting around the\\ncrowd; a woman with thick, shining dark hair and\\nheavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained\\nchair as though it were a throne; and a boy in his late\\nteens, who looked nothing short of petrified. He was\\nshivering, his straw-colored hair all over his face, his\\nfreckled skin milk-white. The wispy little witch beside\\nCrouch began to rock backward and forward in her\\nseat, whimpering into her handkerchief.\\nCrouch stood up. He looked down upon the four in\\nfront of him, and there was pure hatred in his face.\\n“You have been brought here before the Council of\\nMagical Law,” he said clearly, “so that we may pass\\njudgment on you, for a crime so heinous — ”\\n“Father,” said the boy with the straw-colored hair.\\n“Father ... please ...”\\n“ — that we have rarely heard the like of it within this\\ncourt,” said Crouch, speaking more loudly, drowning\\nout his son’s voice. “We have heard the evidence\\nagainst you. The four of you stand accused of\\ncapturing an Auror — Frank Longbottom — and\\nsubjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him\\nto have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your\\nexiled master, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named — ”\\n“Father, I didn’t!” shrieked the boy in chains below. “I\\ndidn’t, I swear it, Father, don’t send me back to the\\ndementors — ”\\n“You are further accused,” bellowed Mr. Crouch, “of\\nusing the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom’s\\nwife, when he would not give you information. You\\nplanned to restore He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to\\npower, and to resume the lives of violence you\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\npresumably led while he was strong. I now ask the\\njury — ”\\n“Mother!” screamed the boy below, and the wispy little\\nwitch beside Crouch began to sob, rocking backward\\nand forward. “Mother, stop him, Mother, I didn’t do it,\\nit wasn’t me!”\\n“I now ask the jury,” shouted Mr. Crouch, “to raise\\ntheir hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes\\ndeserve a life sentence in Azkaban!”\\nIn unison, the witches and wizards along the right-\\nhand side of the dungeon raised their hands. The\\ncrowd around the walls began to clap as it had for\\nBagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy\\nbegan to scream.\\n“No! Mother, no! I didn’t do it, I didn’t do it, I didn’t\\nknow! Don’t send me there, don’t let him!”\\nThe dementors were gliding back into the room. The\\nboys’ three companions rose quietly from their seats;\\nthe woman with the heavy-lidded eyes looked up at\\nCrouch and called, “The Dark Lord will rise again,\\nCrouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will\\nrise again and will come for us, he will reward us\\nbeyond any of his other supporters! We alone were\\nfaithful! We alone tried to find him!”\\nBut the boy was trying to fight off the dementors,\\neven though Harry could see their cold, draining\\npower starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering,\\nsome of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of\\nthe dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle.\\n“I’m your son!” he screamed up at Crouch. “I’m your\\nson!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You are no son of mine!” bellowed Mr. Crouch, his\\neyes bulging suddenly. “I have no son!”\\nThe wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and\\nslumped in her seat. She had fainted. Crouch\\nappeared not to have noticed.\\n“Take them away!” Crouch roared at the dementors,\\nspit flying from his mouth. “Take them away, and\\nmay they rot there!”\\n“Father! Father, I wasn’t involved! No! No! Father,\\nplease!”\\n“I think, Harry, it is time to return to my office,” said\\na quiet voice in Harry’s ear.\\nHarry started. He looked around. Then he looked on\\nhis other side.\\nThere was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right,\\nwatching Crouch’s son being dragged away by the\\ndementors — and there was an Albus Dumbledore on\\nhis left, looking right at him.\\n“Come,” said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put\\nhis hand under Harry’s elbow. Harry felt himself\\nrising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him;\\nfor a moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as\\nthough he had done a slow-motion somersault,\\nsuddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like\\nthe dazzling light of Dumbledore ’s sunlit office. The\\nstone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of\\nhim, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside\\nhim.\\n“Professor,” Harry gasped, “I know I shouldn’t’ve — I\\ndidn’t mean — the cabinet door was sort of open and\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“I quite understand,” said Dumbledore. He lifted the\\nbasin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the\\npolished top, and sat down in the chair behind it. He\\nmotioned for Harry to sit down opposite him.\\nHarry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents\\nhad returned to their original, silvery-white state,\\nswirling and rippling beneath his gaze.\\n“What is it?” Harry asked shakily.\\n“This? It is called a Pensieve,” said Dumbledore. “I\\nsometimes find, and I am sure you know the feeling,\\nthat I simply have too many thoughts and memories\\ncrammed into my mind.”\\n“Er,” said Harry, who couldn’t truthfully say that he\\nhad ever felt anything of the sort.\\n“At these times,” said Dumbledore, indicating the\\nstone basin, “I use the Pensieve. One simply siphons\\nthe excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into\\nthe basin, and examines them at one’s leisure. It\\nbecomes easier to spot patterns and links, you\\nunderstand, when they are in this form.”\\n“You mean . . . that stuff’s your thoughts?” Harry said,\\nstaring at the swirling white substance in the basin.\\n“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Let me show you.”\\nDumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his\\nrobes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair,\\nnear his temple. When he took the wand away, hair\\nseemed to be clinging to it — but then Harry saw that\\nit was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange\\nsilvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve.\\nDumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin,\\nand Harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming\\n \\naround the surface of the bowl. Dumbledore placed\\nhis long hands on either side of the Pensieve and\\nswirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for\\nfragments of gold . . . and Harry saw his own face\\nchange smoothly into Snape’s, who opened his mouth\\nand spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.\\n“It’s coming back ... Karkaroff’s too ... stronger and\\nclearer than ever ...”\\n“A connection I could have made without assistance,”\\nDumbledore sighed, “but never mind.” He peered over\\nthe top of his half-moon spectacles at Harry, who was\\ngaping at Snape’s face, which was continuing to swirl\\naround the bowl. “I was using the Pensieve when Mr.\\nFudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather\\nhastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door\\nproperly. Naturally, it would have attracted your\\nattention.”\\n“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled.\\nDumbledore shook his head. “Curiosity is not a sin,”\\nhe said. “But we should exercise caution with our\\ncuriosity ... yes, indeed ...”\\nFrowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the\\nbasin with the tip of his wand. Instantly, a figure rose\\nout of it, a plump, scowling girl of about sixteen, who\\nbegan to revolve slowly, with her feet still in the basin.\\nShe took no notice whatsoever of Harry or Professor\\nDumbledore. When she spoke, her voice echoed as\\nSnape’s had done, as though it were coming from the\\ndepths of the stone basin. “He put a hex on me,\\nProfessor Dumbledore, and I was only teasing him,\\nsir. I only said I’d seen him kissing Florence behind\\nthe greenhouses last Thursday. ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“But why, Bertha,” said Dumbledore sadly, looking up\\nat the now silently revolving girl, “why did you have to\\nfollow him in the first place?”\\n“Bertha?” Harry whispered, looking up at her. “Is that\\n— was that Bertha Jorkins?”\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the\\nbasin again; Bertha sank back into them, and they\\nbecame silvery and opaque once more. “That was\\nBertha as I remember her at school.”\\nThe silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated\\nDumbledore’s face, and it struck Harry suddenly how\\nvery old he was looking. He knew, of course, that\\nDumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he\\nnever really thought of Dumbledore as an old man.\\n“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Before you got\\nlost in my thoughts, you wanted to tell me\\nsomething.”\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “Professor — I was in Divination\\njust now, and — er — I fell asleep.”\\nHe hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was\\ncoming, but Dumbledore merely said, “Quite\\nunderstandable. Continue.”\\n“Well, I had a dream,” said Harry. “A dream about\\nLord Voldemort. He was torturing Wormtail ... you\\nknow who Wormtail — ”\\n“I do know,” said Dumbledore promptly. “Please\\ncontinue.”\\n“Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said\\nsomething like, Wormtail’s blunder had been\\nrepaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said,\\n \\nWormtail wouldn’t be fed to the snake — there was a\\nsnake beside his chair. He said — he said he’d be\\nfeeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus\\nCurse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt,” Harry said.\\n“It woke me up, it hurt so badly.”\\nDumbledore merely looked at him.\\n“Er — that’s all,” said Harry.\\n“I see,” said Dumbledore quietly. “I see. Now, has your\\nscar hurt at any other time this year, excepting the\\ntime it woke you up over the summer?”\\n“No, I — how did you know it woke me up over the\\nsummer?” said Harry, astonished.\\n“You are not Sirius’s only correspondent,” said\\nDumbledore. “I have also been in contact with him\\never since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who\\nsuggested the mountainside cave as the safest place\\nfor him to stay.”\\nDumbledore got up and began walking up and down\\nbehind his desk. Every now and then, he placed his\\nwand tip to his temple, removed another shining\\nsilver thought, and added it to the Pensieve. The\\nthoughts inside began to swirl so fast that Harry\\ncouldn’t make out anything clearly: It was merely a\\nblur of color.\\n“Professor?” he said quietly, after a couple of minutes.\\nDumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.\\n“My apologies,” he said quietly. He sat back down at\\nhis desk.\\n“D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?”\\n \\nDumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a\\nmoment, and then said, “I have a theory, no more\\nthan that. ... It is my belief that your scar hurts both\\nwhen Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is\\nfeeling a particularly strong surge of hatred.”\\n“But ... why?”\\n“Because you and he are connected by the curse that\\nfailed,” said Dumbledore. “That is no ordinary scar.”\\n“So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?”\\n“It is possible,” said Dumbledore. “I would say —\\nprobable. Harry — did you see Voldemort?”\\n“No,” said Harry. “Just the back of his chair. But —\\nthere wouldn’t have been anything to see, would\\nthere? I mean, he hasn’t got a body, has he? But ...\\nbut then how could he have held the wand?” Harry\\nsaid slowly.\\n“How indeed?” muttered Dumbledore. “How indeed\\nNeither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while.\\nDumbledore was gazing across the room, and, every\\nnow and then, placing his wand tip to his temple and\\nadding another shining silver thought to the seething\\nmass within the Pensieve.\\n“Professor,” Harry said at last, “do you think he’s\\ngetting stronger?”\\n“Voldemort?” said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over\\nthe Pensieve. It was the characteristic, piercing look\\nDumbledore had given him on other occasions, and\\nalways made Harry feel as though Dumbledore were\\nseeing right through him in a way that even Moody’s\\n \\nmagical eye could not. “Once again, Harry, I can only\\ngive you my suspicions.”\\nDumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and\\nwearier, than ever.\\n“The years of Voldemort’s ascent to power,” he said,\\n“were marked with disappearances. Bertha Jorkins\\nhas vanished without a trace in the place where\\nVoldemort was certainly known to be last. Mr. Crouch\\ntoo has disappeared ... within these very grounds.\\nAnd there was a third disappearance, one which the\\nMinistry, I regret to say, do not consider of any\\nimportance, for it concerns a Muggle. His name was\\nFrank Bryce, he lived in the village where Voldemort’s\\nfather grew up, and he has not been seen since last\\nAugust. You see, I read the Muggle newspapers,\\nunlike most of my Ministry friends.”\\nDumbledore looked very seriously at Harry.\\n“These disappearances seem to me to be linked. The\\nMinistry disagrees — as you may have heard, while\\nwaiting outside my office.”\\nHarry nodded. Silence fell between them again,\\nDumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then.\\nHarry felt as though he ought to go, but his curiosity\\nheld him in his chair.\\n“Professor?” he said again.\\n“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore.\\n“Er . . . could I ask you about . . . that court thing I was\\nin ... in the Pensieve?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You could,” said Dumbledore heavily. “I attended it\\nmany times, but some trials come back to me more\\nclearly than others ... particularly now. ...”\\n“You know — you know the trial you found me in?\\nThe one with Crouch’s son? Well ... were they talking\\nabout Neville’s parents?”\\nDumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look. “Has\\nNeville never told you why he has been brought up by\\nhis grandmother?” he said.\\nHarry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how\\nhe could have failed to ask Neville this, in almost four\\nyears of knowing him.\\n“Yes, they were talking about Neville’s parents,” said\\nDumbledore. “His father, Frank, was an Auror just\\nlike Professor Moody. He and his wife were tortured\\nfor information about Voldemort’s whereabouts after\\nhe lost his powers, as you heard.”\\n“So they’re dead?” said Harry quietly.\\n“No,” said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness\\nHarry had never heard there before. “They are insane.\\nThey are both in St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical\\nMaladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them,\\nwith his grandmother, during the holidays. They do\\nnot recognize him.”\\nHarry sat there, horror-struck. He had never known\\n... never, in four years, bothered to find out ...\\n“The Longbottoms were very popular,” said\\nDumbledore. “The attacks on them came after\\nVoldemort’s fall from power, just when everyone\\nthought they were safe. Those attacks caused a wave\\nof fury such as I have never known. The Ministry was\\n \\nunder great pressure to catch those who had done it.\\nUnfortunately, the Longbottoms’ evidence was —\\ngiven their condition — none too reliable.”\\n“Then Mr. Crouch’s son might not have been\\ninvolved?” said Harry slowly.\\nDumbledore shook his head.\\n“As to that, I have no idea.”\\nHarry sat in silence once more, watching the contents\\nof the Pensieve swirl. There were two more questions\\nhe was burning to ask . . . but they concerned the guilt\\nof living people. ...\\n“Er,” he said, “Mr. Bagman ...”\\n\"... has never been accused of any Dark activity\\nsince,” said Dumbledore calmly.\\n“Right,” said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of\\nthe Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly\\nnow that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts.\\n“And ... er ...”\\nBut the Pensieve seemed to be asking his question for\\nhim. Snape’s face was swimming on the surface\\nagain. Dumbledore glanced down into it, and then up\\nat Harry.\\n“No more has Professor Snape,” he said.\\nHarry looked into Dumbledore ’s light blue eyes, and\\nthe thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his\\nmouth before he could stop it.\\n“What made you think he’d really stopped supporting\\nVoldemort, Professor?”\\n \\nDumbledore held Harry’s gaze for a few seconds, and\\nthen said, “That, Harry, is a matter between Professor\\nSnape and myself.”\\nHarry knew that the interview was over; Dumbledore\\ndid not look angry, yet there was a finality in his tone\\nthat told Harry it was time to go. He stood up, and so\\ndid Dumbledore.\\n“Harry,” he said as Harry reached the door. “Please do\\nnot speak about Neville’s parents to anybody else. He\\nhas the right to let people know, when he is ready.”\\n“Yes, Professor,” said Harry, turning to go.\\n“And — ”\\nHarry looked back. Dumbledore was standing over\\nthe Pensieve, his face lit from beneath by its silvery\\nspots of light, looking older than ever. He stared at\\nHarry for a moment, and then said, “Good luck with\\nthe third task.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE THIRD TASK\\n“Dumbledore reckons You- Know- Who’s getting\\nstronger again as well?” Ron whispered.\\nEverything Harry had seen in the Pensieve, nearly\\neverything Dumbledore had told and shown him\\nafterward, he had now shared with Ron and\\nHermione — and, of course, with Sirius, to whom\\nHarry had sent an owl the moment he had left\\nDumbledore’s office. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat\\nup late in the common room once again that night,\\ntalking it all over until Harry’s mind was reeling, until\\nhe understood what Dumbledore had meant about a\\nhead becoming so full of thoughts that it would have\\nbeen a relief to siphon them off.\\nRon stared into the common room fire. Harry thought\\nhe saw Ron shiver slightly, even though the evening\\nwas warm.\\n“And he trusts Snape?” Ron said. “He really trusts\\nSnape, even though he knows he was a Death Eater?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\nHermione had not spoken for ten minutes. She was\\nsitting with her forehead in her hands, staring at her\\nknees. Harry thought she too looked as though she\\ncould have done with a Pensieve.\\n“Rita Skeeter,” she muttered finally.\\n“How can you be worrying about her now?” said Ron,\\nin utter disbelief.\\n“I’m not worrying about her,” Hermione said to her\\nknees. “I’m just thinking ... remember what she said\\nto me in the Three Broomsticks? ‘I know things about\\nLudo Bagman that would make your hair curl.’ This\\nis what she meant, isn’t it? She reported his trial, she\\nknew he’d passed information to the Death Eaters.\\nAnd Winky too, remember ... ‘Ludo Bagman’s a bad\\nwizard.’ Mr. Crouch would have been furious he got\\noff, he would have talked about it at home.”\\n“Yeah, but Bagman didn’t pass information on\\npurpose, did he?”\\nHermione shrugged.\\n“And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked\\nCrouch?” Ron said, turning back to Harry.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he’s only saying that because\\nCrouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.”\\n“We never thought of her, did we?” said Ron slowly.\\n“Mind you, she’s definitely got giant blood, and she\\ndoesn’t want to admit it — ”\\n“Of course she doesn’t,” said Hermione sharply,\\nlooking up. “Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita\\n \\nfound out about his mother. Look at Fudge, jumping\\nto conclusions about her, just because she’s part\\ngiant. Who needs that sort of prejudice? I’d probably\\nsay I had big bones if I knew that’s what I’d get for\\ntelling the truth.”\\nHermione looked at her watch. “We haven’t done any\\npracticing!” she said, looking shocked. “We were going\\nto do the Impediment Curse! We’ll have to really get\\ndown to it tomorrow! Come on, Harry, you need to get\\nsome sleep.”\\nHarry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their\\ndormitory. As Harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked\\nover at Neville’s bed. True to his word to Dumbledore,\\nhe had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville’s\\nparents. As Harry took off his glasses and climbed\\ninto his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to\\nhave parents still living but unable to recognize you.\\nHe often got sympathy from strangers for being an\\norphan, but as he listened to Neville’s snores, he\\nthought that Neville deserved it more than he did.\\nLying in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and\\nhate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and\\nMrs. Longbottom. ... He remembered the jeers of the\\ncrowd as Crouch’s son and his companions had been\\ndragged from the court by the dementors. ... He\\nunderstood how they had felt. ... Then he\\nremembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy\\nand realized with a jolt that he had died a year later.\\nIt was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the\\ncanopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to\\nVoldemort. ... He was the one who had torn these\\nfamilies apart, who had ruined all these lives. ...\\nRon and Hermione were supposed to be studying for\\ntheir exams, which would finish on the day of the\\n \\nthird task, but they were putting most of their efforts\\ninto helping Harry prepare.\\n“Don’t worry about it,” Hermione said shortly when\\nHarry pointed this out to them and said he didn’t\\nmind practicing on his own for a while, “at least we’ll\\nget top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts. We’d\\nnever have found out about all these hexes in class.”\\n“Good training for when we’re all Aurors,” said Ron\\nexcitedly, attempting the Impediment Curse on a\\nwasp that had buzzed into the room and making it\\nstop dead in midair.\\nThe mood in the castle as they entered June became\\nexcited and tense again. Everyone was looking\\nforward to the third task, which would take place a\\nweek before the end of term. Harry was practicing\\nhexes at every available moment. He felt more\\nconfident about this task than either of the others.\\nDifficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly\\nbe, Moody was right: Harry had managed to find his\\nway past monstrous creatures and enchanted\\nbarriers before now, and this time he had some\\nnotice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay\\nahead.\\nTired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all\\nover the school, Professor McGonagall had given them\\npermission to use the empty Transfiguration\\nclassroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered\\nthe Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and\\nobstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would\\nenable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and\\nthe Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione’s\\nthat would make his wand point due north, therefore\\nenabling him to check whether he was going in the\\nright direction within the maze. He was still having\\ntrouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was\\n \\nsupposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around\\nhimself that deflected minor curses; Hermione\\nmanaged to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs\\nJinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten\\nminutes afterward before she had looked up the\\ncounter-jinx.\\n“You’re still doing really well, though,” Hermione said\\nencouragingly, looking down her list and crossing off\\nthose spells they had already learned. “Some of these\\nare bound to come in handy.”\\n“Come and look at this,” said Ron, who was standing\\nby the window. He was staring down onto the\\ngrounds. “What’s Malfoy doing?”\\nHarry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and\\nGoyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below.\\nCrabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout;\\nboth were smirking. Malfoy was holding his hand up\\nto his mouth and speaking into it.\\n“He looks like he’s using a walkie-talkie,” said Harry\\ncuriously.\\n“He can’t be,” said Hermione, “I’ve told you, those\\nsorts of things don’t work around Hogwarts. Come on,\\nHarry,” she added briskly, turning away from the\\nwindow and moving back into the middle of the room,\\n“let’s try that Shield Charm again.”\\nSirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he\\nseemed to want to concentrate on getting Harry\\nthrough the last task before they concerned\\nthemselves with anything else. He reminded Harry in\\nevery letter that whatever might be going on outside\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nthe walls of Hogwarts was not Harry’s responsibility,\\nnor was it within his power to influence it.\\nIf Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote,\\nmy priority is to ensure your safety. He cannot hope to\\nlay hands on you while you are under Dumbledore’s\\nprotection, but all the same, take no risks : Concentrate\\non getting through that maze safely, and then we can\\nturn our attention to other matters.\\nHarry’s nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth\\ndrew closer, but they were not as bad as those he had\\nfelt before the first and second tasks. For one thing,\\nhe was confident that, this time, he had done\\neverything in his power to prepare for the task. For\\nanother, this was the final hurdle, and however well\\nor badly he did, the tournament would at last be over,\\nwhich would be an enormous relief.\\nBreakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor\\ntable on the morning of the third task. The post owls\\nappeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from\\nSirius. It was only a piece of parchment, folded over\\nand bearing a muddy paw print on its front, but\\nHarry appreciated it all the same. A screech owl\\narrived for Hermione, carrying her morning copy of\\nthe Daily Prophet as usual. She unfolded the paper,\\nglanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of\\npumpkin juice all over it.\\n“What?” said Harry and Ron together, staring at her.\\n“Nothing,” said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the\\npaper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it. He stared at\\nthe headline and said, “No way. Not today. That old\\ncow.”\\n“What?” said Harry. “Rita Skeeter again?”\\n \\n“No,” said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted\\nto push the paper out of sight.\\n“It’s about me, isn’t it?” said Harry.\\n“No,” said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone.\\nBut before Harry could demand to see the paper,\\nDraco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the\\nSlytherin table.\\n“Hey, Potter! Potteri How’s your head? You feeling all\\nright? Sure you’re not going to go berserk on us?”\\nMalfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet too.\\nSlytherins up and down the table were sniggering,\\ntwisting in their seats to see Harry’s reaction.\\n“Let me see it,” Harry said to Ron. “Give it here.”\\nVery reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper.\\nHarry turned it over and found himself staring at his\\nown picture, beneath the banner headline:\\nHARRY POTTER\\n“DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS”\\nThe boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is\\nunstable and possibly dangerous, writes Rita Skeeter,\\nSpecial Correspondent. Alarming evidence has\\nrecently come to light about Harry Potter’s strange\\nbehavior, which casts doubts upon his suitability to\\ncompete in a demanding competition like the Triwizard\\nTournament, or even to attend Hogwarts School.\\nPotter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal,\\nregularly collapses at school, and is often heard to\\ncomplain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic of the\\n \\ncurse with which You-Know-Who attempted to kill him).\\nOn Monday last, midway through a Divination lesson,\\nyour Daily Prophet reporter witnessed Potter storming\\nfrom the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too\\nbadly to continue studying.\\nIt is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo’s Hospital\\nfor Magical Maladies and Injuries, that Potter’s brain\\nwas affected by the attack inflicted upon him by You-\\nKnow-Who, and that his insistence that the scar is\\nstill hurting is an expression of his deep-seated\\nconfusion.\\n“He might even be pretending,” said one specialist.\\n“This could be a plea for attention.”\\nThe Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying\\nfacts about Harry Potter thatAlbus Dumbledore,\\nHeadmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from\\nthe wizarding public.\\n“Potter can speak Parseltongue, ” reveals Draco Malfoy,\\na Hogwarts fourth year. “There were a lot of attacks\\non students a couple of years ago, and most people\\nthought Potter was behind them after they saw him\\nlose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on\\nanother boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he’s\\nmade friends with werewolves and giants too. We\\nthink he’d do anything for a bit of power.”\\nParseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has\\nlong been considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most\\nfamous Parselmouth of our times is none other than\\nYou-Know-Who himself. A member of the Dark Force\\nDefense League, who wished to remain unnamed,\\nstated that he would regard any wizard who could\\nspeak Parseltongue “as worthy of investigation.\\nPersonally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody\\nwho could converse with snakes, as serpents are\\n \\noften used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are\\nhistorically associated with evildoers.” Similarly,\\n“anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious\\ncreatures as werewolves and giants would appear to\\nhave a fondness for violence.”\\nAlbus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a\\nboy such as this should be allowed to compete in the\\nTriwizard Tournament. Some fear that Potter might\\nresort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the\\ntournament, the third task of which takes place this\\nevening.\\n“Gone off me a bit, hasn’t she?” said Harry lightly,\\nfolding up the paper.\\nOver at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\\nwere laughing at him, tapping their heads with their\\nfingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling\\ntheir tongues like snakes.\\n“How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?”\\nRon said. “There’s no way she was there, there’s no\\nway she could’ve heard — ”\\n“The window was open,” said Harry. “I opened it to\\nbreathe.”\\n“You were at the top of North Tower!” Hermione said.\\n“Your voice couldn’t have carried all the way down to\\nthe grounds!”\\n“Well, you’re the one who’s supposed to be\\nresearching magical methods of bugging!” said Harry.\\n“You tell me how she did it!”\\n“I’ve been trying!” said Hermione. “But I ... but ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nAn odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over\\nHermione ’s face. She slowly raised a hand and ran\\nher fingers through her hair.\\n“Are you all right?” said Ron, frowning at her.\\n“Yes,” said Hermione breathlessly. She ran her fingers\\nthrough her hair again, and then held her hand up to\\nher mouth, as though speaking into an invisible\\nwalkie-talkie. Harry and Ron stared at each other.\\n“I’ve had an idea,” Hermione said, gazing into space.\\n“I think I know . . . because then no one would be able\\nto see ... even Moody ... and she’d have been able to\\nget onto the window ledge ... but she’s not allowed ...\\nshe’s definitely not allowed ... I think we’ve got her!\\nJust give me two seconds in the library — just to\\nmake sure!”\\nWith that, Hermione seized her school bag and\\ndashed out of the Great Hall.\\n“Oi!” Ron called after her. “We’ve got our History of\\nMagic exam in ten minutes! Blimey,” he said, turning\\nback to Harry, “she must really hate that Skeeter\\nwoman to risk missing the start of an exam. What’re\\nyou going to do in Binns’s class — read again?”\\nExempt from the end-of-term tests as a Triwizard\\nchampion, Harry had been sitting in the back of every\\nexam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for the third\\ntask.\\n“S’pose so,” Harry said to Ron; but just then,\\nProfessor McGonagall came walking alongside the\\nGryffindor table toward him.\\n“Potter, the champions are congregating in the\\nchamber off the Hall after breakfast,” she said.\\n \\n“But the task’s not till tonight!” said Harry,\\naccidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front,\\nafraid he had mistaken the time.\\n“I’m aware of that, Potter,” she said. “The champions’\\nfamilies are invited to watch the final task, you know.\\nThis is simply a chance for you to greet them.”\\nShe moved away. Harry gaped after her.\\n“She doesn’t expect the Dursleys to turn up, does\\nshe?” he asked Ron blankly.\\n“Dunno,” said Ron. “Harry, I’d better hurry, I’m going\\nto be late for Binns. See you later.”\\nHarry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great\\nHall. He saw Fleur Delacour get up from the\\nRavenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the\\nside chamber and entered. Krum slouched off to join\\nthem shortly afterward. Harry stayed where he was.\\nHe really didn’t want to go into the chamber. He had\\nno family — no family who would turn up to see him\\nrisk his life, anyway. But just as he was getting up,\\nthinking that he might as well go up to the library\\nand do a spot more hex research, the door of the side\\nchamber opened, and Cedric stuck his head out.\\n“Harry, come on, they’re waiting for you!”\\nUtterly perplexed, Harry got up. The Dursleys\\ncouldn’t possibly be here, could they? He walked\\nacross the Hall and opened the door into the\\nchamber.\\nCedric and his parents were just inside the door.\\nViktor Krum was over in a corner, conversing with his\\ndark-haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian. He\\nhad inherited his father’s hooked nose. On the other\\n \\nside of the room, Fleur was jabbering away in French\\nto her mother. Fleur’s little sister, Gabrielle, was\\nholding her mother’s hand. She waved at Harry, who\\nwaved back, grinning. Then he saw Mrs. Weasley and\\nBill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him.\\n“Surprise!” Mrs. Weasley said excitedly as he smiled\\nbroadly and walked over to them. “Thought we’d come\\nand watch you, Harry!” She bent down and kissed\\nhim on the cheek.\\n“You all right?” said Bill, grinning at Harry and\\nshaking his hand. “Charlie wanted to come, but he\\ncouldn’t get time off. He said you were incredible\\nagainst the Horntail.”\\nFleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with\\ngreat interest over her mother’s shoulder. Harry could\\ntell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or\\nearrings with fangs on them.\\n“This is really nice of you,” Harry muttered to Mrs.\\nWeasley. “I thought for a moment — the Dursleys — ”\\n“Hmm,” said Mrs. Weasley, pursing her lips. She had\\nalways refrained from criticizing the Dursleys in front\\nof Harry, but her eyes flashed every time they were\\nmentioned.\\n“It’s great being back here,” said Bill, looking around\\nthe chamber (Violet, the Fat Lady’s friend, winked at\\nhim from her frame). “Haven’t seen this place for five\\nyears. Is that picture of the mad knight still around?\\nSir Cadogan?”\\n“Oh yeah,” said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the\\nprevious year.\\n“And the Fat Lady?” said Bill.\\n \\n“She was here in my time,” said Mrs. Weasley. “She\\ngave me such a telling off one night when I got back\\nto the dormitory at four in the morning — ”\\n“What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in\\nthe morning?” said Bill, surveying his mother with\\namazement.\\nMrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling.\\n“Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll,”\\nshe said. “He got caught by Apollyon Pringle — he\\nwas the caretaker in those days — your father’s still\\ngot the marks.”\\n“Fancy giving us a tour, Harry?” said Bill.\\n“Yeah, okay,” said Harry, and they made their way\\nback toward the door into the Great Hall. As they\\npassed Amos Diggory, he looked around.\\n“There you are, are you?” he said, looking Harry up\\nand down. “Bet you’re not feeling quite as full of\\nyourself now Cedric’s caught you up on points, are\\nyou?”\\n“What?” said Harry.\\n“Ignore him,” said Cedric in a low voice to Harry,\\nfrowning after his father. “He’s been angry ever since\\nRita Skeeter’s article about the Triwizard Tournament\\n— you know, when she made out you were the only\\nHogwarts champion.”\\n“Didn’t bother to correct her, though, did he?” said\\nAmos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he\\nstarted to walk out of the door with Mrs. Weasley and\\nBill. “Still ... you’ll show him, Ced. Beaten him once\\nbefore, haven’t you?”\\n \\n“Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble,\\nAmos!” Mrs. Weasley said angrily. “I would have\\nthought you’d know that, working at the Ministry!”\\nMr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say\\nsomething angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm,\\nand he merely shrugged and turned away.\\nHarry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the\\nsunny grounds with Bill and Mrs. Weasley, showing\\nthem the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang\\nship. Mrs. Weasley was intrigued by the Whomping\\nWillow, which had been planted after she had left\\nschool, and reminisced at length about the\\ngamekeeper before Hagrid, a man called Ogg.\\n“How’s Percy?” Harry asked as they walked around\\nthe greenhouses.\\n“Not good,” said Bill.\\n“He’s very upset,” said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her\\nvoice and glancing around. “The Ministry wants to\\nkeep Mr. Crouch’s disappearance quiet, but Percy’s\\nbeen hauled in for questioning about the instructions\\nMr. Crouch has been sending in. They seem to think\\nthere’s a chance they weren’t genuinely written by\\nhim. Percy’s been under a lot of strain. They’re not\\nletting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge\\ntonight. Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it.”\\nThey returned to the castle for lunch.\\n“Mum — Bill!” said Ron, looking stunned, as he\\njoined the Gryffindor table. “What ’re you doing here?”\\n“Come to watch Harry in the last task!” said Mrs.\\nWeasley brightly. “I must say, it makes a lovely\\nchange, not having to cook. How was your exam?”\\n \\n“Oh ... okay,” said Ron. “Couldn’t remember all the\\ngoblin rebels’ names, so I invented a few. It’s all\\nright,” he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty,\\nwhile Mrs. Weasley looked stern, “they’re all called\\nstuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it\\nwasn’t hard.”\\nFred, George, and Ginny came to sit next to them too,\\nand Harry was having such a good time he felt almost\\nas though he were back at the Burrow; he had\\nforgotten to worry about that evening’s task, and not\\nuntil Hermione turned up, halfway through lunch,\\ndid he remember that she had had a brainwave about\\nRita Skeeter.\\n“Are you going to tell us — ?”\\nHermione shook her head warningly and glanced at\\nMrs. Weasley.\\n“Hello, Hermione,” said Mrs. Weasley, much more\\nstiffly than usual.\\n“Hello,” said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold\\nexpression on Mrs. Weasley’s face.\\nHarry looked between them, then said, “Mrs. Weasley,\\nyou didn’t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in\\nWitch Weekly, did you? Because Hermione ’s not my\\ngirlfriend.”\\n“Oh!” said Mrs. Weasley. “No — of course I didn’t!”\\nBut she became considerably warmer toward\\nHermione after that.\\nHarry, Bill, and Mrs. Weasley whiled away the\\nafternoon with a long walk around the castle, and\\nthen returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast.\\n \\nLudo Bagman and Cornelius Fudge had joined the\\nstaff table now. Bagman looked quite cheerful, but\\nCornelius Fudge, who was sitting next to Madame\\nMaxime, looked stern and was not talking. Madame\\nMaxime was concentrating on her plate, and Harry\\nthought her eyes looked red. Hagrid kept glancing\\nalong the table at her.\\nThere were more courses than usual, but Harry, who\\nwas starting to feel really nervous now, didn’t eat\\nmuch. As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to\\nfade from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to\\nhis feet at the staff table, and silence fell.\\n“Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes’ time, I will be\\nasking you to make your way down to the Quidditch\\nfield for the third and final task of the Triwizard\\nTournament. Will the champions please follow Mr.\\nBagman down to the stadium now.”\\nHarry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were\\napplauding him; the Weasleys and Hermione all\\nwished him good luck, and he headed off out of the\\nGreat Hall with Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor.\\n“Feeling all right, Harry?” Bagman asked as they went\\ndown the stone steps onto the grounds. “Confident?”\\n“I’m okay,” said Harry. It was sort of true; he was\\nnervous, but he kept running over all the hexes and\\nspells he had been practicing in his mind as they\\nwalked, and the knowledge that he could remember\\nthem all made him feel better.\\nThey walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now\\ncompletely unrecognizable. A twenty-foot-high hedge\\nran all the way around the edge of it. There was a gap\\nright in front of them: the entrance to the vast maze.\\nThe passage beyond it looked dark and creepy.\\n \\nFive minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the\\nair was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet\\nas the hundreds of students filed into their seats. The\\nsky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars\\nwere starting to appear. Hagrid, Professor Moody,\\nProfessor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came\\nwalking into the stadium and approached Bagman\\nand the champions. They were wearing large, red,\\nluminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who\\nhad his on the back of his moleskin vest.\\n“We are going to be patrolling the outside of the\\nmaze,” said Professor McGonagall to the champions.\\n“If you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued,\\nsend red sparks into the air, and one of us will come\\nand get you, do you understand?”\\nThe champions nodded.\\n“Off you go, then!” said Bagman brightly to the four\\npatrollers.\\n“Good luck, Harry,” Hagrid whispered, and the four of\\nthem walked away in different directions, to station\\nthemselves around the maze. Bagman now pointed\\nhis wand at his throat, muttered, “ Sonorus,” and his\\nmagically magnified voice echoed into the stands.\\n“Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the\\nTriwizard Tournament is about to begin! Let me\\nremind you how the points currently stand! Tied in\\nfirst place, with eighty-five points each — Mr. Cedric\\nDiggory and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts\\nSchool!” The cheers and applause sent birds from the\\nForbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky.\\n“In second place, with eighty points — Mr. Viktor\\nKrum, of Durmstrang Institute!” More applause. “And\\nin third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons\\nAcademy!”\\n \\nHarry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron,\\nand Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up\\nthe stands. He waved up at them, and they waved\\nback, beaming at him.\\n“So ... on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said\\nBagman. “Three — two — one — ”\\nHe gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and\\nCedric hurried forward into the maze.\\nThe towering hedges cast black shadows across the\\npath, and, whether because they were so tall and\\nthick or because they had been enchanted, the sound\\nof the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment\\nthey entered the maze. Harry felt almost as though he\\nwere underwater again. He pulled out his wand,\\nmuttered, “Lumos,” and heard Cedric do the same\\njust behind him.\\nAfter about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They\\nlooked at each other.\\n“See you,” Harry said, and he took the left one, while\\nCedric took the right.\\nHarry heard Bagman’s whistle for the second time.\\nKrum had entered the maze. Harry sped up. His\\nchosen path seemed completely deserted. He turned\\nright, and hurried on, holding his wand high over his\\nhead, trying to see as far ahead as possible. Still,\\nthere was nothing in sight.\\nBagman’s whistle blew in the distance for the third\\ntime. All of the champions were now inside.\\nHarry kept looking behind him. The old feeling that\\nhe was being watched was upon him. The maze was\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ngrowing darker with every passing minute as the sky\\noverhead deepened to navy. He reached a second fork.\\n“ Point Me,” he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in\\nhis palm.\\nThe wand spun around once and pointed toward his\\nright, into solid hedge. That way was north, and he\\nknew that he needed to go northwest for the center of\\nthe maze. The best he could do was to take the left\\nfork and go right again as soon as possible.\\nThe path ahead was empty too, and when Harry\\nreached a right turn and took it, he again found his\\nway unblocked. Harry didn’t know why, but the lack\\nof obstacles was unnerving him. Surely he should\\nhave met something by now? It felt as though the\\nmaze were luring him into a false sense of security.\\nThen he heard movement right behind him. He held\\nout his wand, ready to attack, but its beam fell only\\nupon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on\\nthe right-hand side. Cedric looked severely shaken.\\nThe sleeve of his robe was smoking.\\n“Hagrid’s Blast-Ended Skrewts!” he hissed. “They’re\\nenormous — I only just got away!”\\nHe shook his head and dived out of sight, along\\nanother path. Keen to put plenty of distance between\\nhimself and the skrewts, Harry hurried off again.\\nThen, as he turned a corner, he saw ... a dementor\\ngliding toward him. Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by\\nits hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it\\nadvanced, sensing its way blindly toward him. Harry\\ncould hear its rattling breath; he felt clammy coldness\\nstealing over him, but knew what he had to do. ...\\nHe summoned the happiest thought he could,\\nconcentrated with all his might on the thought of\\n \\ngetting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and\\nHermione, raised his wand, and cried, “Expecto\\nPatronum).”\\nA silver stag erupted from the end of Harry’s wand\\nand galloped toward the dementor, which fell back\\nand tripped over the hem of its robes. ... Harry had\\nnever seen a dementor stumble.\\n“Hang on!” he shouted, advancing in the wake of his\\nsilver Patronus. “You’re a boggart! Riddikulusl”\\nThere was a loud crack, and the shape-shifter\\nexploded in a wisp of smoke. The silver stag faded\\nfrom sight. Harry wished it could have stayed, he\\ncould have used some company . . . but he moved on,\\nquickly and quietly as possible, listening hard, his\\nwand held high once more.\\nLeft . . . right . . . left again . . . Twice he found himself\\nfacing dead ends. He did the Four-Point Spell again\\nand found that he was going too far east. He turned\\nback, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist\\nfloating ahead of him.\\nHarry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand’s\\nbeam at it. This looked like some kind of\\nenchantment. He wondered whether he might be able\\nto blast it out of the way.\\n“Reductol” he said.\\nThe spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it\\nintact. He supposed he should have known better; the\\nReductor Curse was for solid objects. What would\\nhappen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth\\nchancing it, or should he double back?\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHe was still hesitating when a scream shattered the\\nsilence.\\n“Fleur?” Harry yelled.\\nThere was silence. He stared all around him. What\\nhad happened to her? Her scream seemed to have\\ncome from somewhere ahead. He took a deep breath\\nand ran through the enchanted mist.\\nThe world turned upside down. Harry was hanging\\nfrom the ground, with his hair on end, his glasses\\ndangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the\\nbottomless sky. He clutched them to the end of his\\nnose and hung there, terrified. It felt as though his\\nfeet were glued to the grass, which had now become\\nthe ceiling. Below him the dark, star-spangled\\nheavens stretched endlessly. He felt as though if he\\ntried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from\\nthe earth completely.\\nThink , he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his\\nhead, think ...\\nBut not one of the spells he had practiced had been\\ndesigned to combat a sudden reversal of ground and\\nsky. Did he dare move his foot? He could hear the\\nblood pounding in his ears. He had two choices — try\\nand move, or send up red sparks, and get rescued\\nand disqualified from the task.\\nHe shut his eyes, so he wouldn’t be able to see the\\nview of endless space below him, and pulled his right\\nfoot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling.\\nImmediately, the world righted itself. Harry fell\\nforward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid\\nground. He felt temporarily limp with shock. He took\\na deep, steadying breath, then got up again and\\n \\nhurried forward, looking back over his shoulder as he\\nran away from the golden mist, which twinkled\\ninnocently at him in the moonlight.\\nHe paused at a junction of two paths and looked\\naround for some sign of Fleur. He was sure it had\\nbeen she who had screamed. What had she met? Was\\nshe all right? There was no sign of red sparks — did\\nthat mean she had got herself out of trouble, or was\\nshe in such trouble that she couldn’t reach her\\nwand? Harry took the right fork with a feeling of\\nincreasing unease ... but at the same time, he\\ncouldn’t help thinking, One champion down ...\\nThe cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as\\nthough Fleur was no longer in the running. He’d got\\nthis far, hadn’t he? What if he actually managed to\\nwin? Fleetingly, and for the first time since he’d found\\nhimself champion, he saw again that image of\\nhimself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest\\nof the school. ...\\nHe met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running\\ninto dead ends. Twice he took the same wrong\\nturning. Finally, he found a new route and started to\\njog along it, his wandlight waving, making his shadow\\nflicker and distort on the hedge walls. Then he\\nrounded another corner and found himself facing a\\nBlast-Ended Skrewt.\\nCedric was right — it was enormous. Ten feet long, it\\nlooked more like a giant scorpion than anything. Its\\nlong sting was curled over its back. Its thick armor\\nglinted in the light from Harry’s wand, which he\\npointed at it.\\n“Stupefy\\'.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThe spell hit the skrewt’s armor and rebounded;\\nHarry ducked just in time, but could smell burning\\nhair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt\\nissued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward\\ntoward him.\\n“ Impedimental ” Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s\\narmor again and ricocheted off; Harry staggered back\\na few paces and fell over. a IMPEDIMENT A\\\\”\\nThe skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he\\nhad managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell-less\\nunderside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from\\nit and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the\\nImpediment Curse was not permanent; the skrewt\\nwould be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.\\nHe took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and\\nhit another; forcing himself to stop, heart hammering,\\nhe performed the Four-Point Spell again,\\nbacktracked, and chose a path that would take him\\nnorthwest.\\nHe had been hurrying along the new path for a few\\nminutes, when he heard something in the path\\nrunning parallel to his own that made him stop dead.\\n“What are you doing?” yelled Cedric’s voice. “What the\\nhell d’you think you’re doing?”\\nAnd then Harry heard Krum’s voice.\\n“ Crucio \\\\ ”\\nThe air was suddenly full of Cedric’s yells. Horrified,\\nHarry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a\\nway into Cedric’s. When none appeared, he tried the\\nReductor Curse again. It wasn’t very effective, but it\\nburned a small hole in the hedge through which\\n \\nHarry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles\\nand branches until they broke and made an opening;\\nhe struggled through it, tearing his robes, and looking\\nto his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the\\nground, Krum standing over him.\\nHarry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at\\nKrum just as Krum looked up. Krum turned and\\nbegan to run.\\n“ Stupefy]” Harry yelled.\\nThe spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in\\nhis tracks, fell forward, and lay motionless, facedown\\nin the grass. Harry dashed over to Cedric, who had\\nstopped twitching and was lying there panting, his\\nhands over his face.\\n“Are you all right?” Harry said roughly, grabbing\\nCedric’s arm.\\n“Yeah,” panted Cedric. “Yeah ... I don’t believe it ... he\\ncrept up behind me. ... I heard him, I turned around,\\nand he had his wand on me. ...”\\nCedric got up. He was still shaking. He and Harry\\nlooked down at Krum.\\n“I can’t believe this ... I thought he was all right,”\\nHarry said, staring at Krum.\\n“So did I,” said Cedric.\\n“Did you hear Fleur scream earlier?” said Harry.\\n“Yeah,” said Cedric. “You don’t think Krum got her\\ntoo?”\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry slowly.\\n \\n“Should we leave him here?” Cedric muttered.\\n“No,” said Harry. “I reckon we should send up red\\nsparks. Someone’ll come and collect him ... otherwise\\nhe’ll probably be eaten by a skrewt.”\\n“He’d deserve it,” Cedric muttered, but all the same,\\nhe raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks\\ninto the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking\\nthe spot where he lay.\\nHarry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a\\nmoment, looking around them. Then Cedric said,\\n“Well ... I s’pose we’d better go on . ...”\\n“What?” said Harry. “Oh ... yeah ... right ...”\\nIt was an odd moment. He and Cedric had been\\nbriefly united against Krum — now the fact that they\\nwere opponents came back to Harry. The two of them\\nproceeded up the dark path without speaking, then\\nHarry turned left, and Cedric right. Cedric’s footsteps\\nsoon died away.\\nHarry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point\\nSpell, making sure he was moving in the right\\ndirection. It was between him and Cedric now. His\\ndesire to reach the cup first was now burning\\nstronger than ever, but he could hardly believe what\\nhe’d just seen Krum do. The use of an Unforgivable\\nCurse on a fellow human being meant a life term in\\nAzkaban, that was what Moody had told them. Krum\\nsurely couldn’t have wanted the Triwizard Cup that\\nbadly. ... Harry sped up.\\nEvery so often he hit more dead ends, but the\\nincreasing darkness made him feel sure he was\\ngetting near the heart of the maze. Then, as he strode\\ndown a long, straight path, he saw movement once\\n \\nagain, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary\\ncreature, one which he had only seen in picture form,\\nin his Monster Book of Monsters.\\nIt was a sphinx. It had the body of an over-large lion:\\ngreat clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in\\na brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman.\\nShe turned her long, almond-shaped eyes upon Harry\\nas he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating.\\nShe was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing\\nfrom side to side of the path, blocking his progress.\\nThen she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.\\n“You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past\\nme.”\\n“So ... so will you move, please?” said Harry, knowing\\nwhat the answer was going to be.\\n“No,” she said, continuing to pace. “Not unless you\\ncan answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess — I\\nlet you pass. Answer wrongly — I attack. Remain\\nsilent — I will let you walk away from me unscathed.”\\nHarry’s stomach slipped several notches. It was\\nHermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him.\\nHe weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he\\ncould keep silent, get away from the sphinx\\nunharmed, and try and find an alternative route to\\nthe center.\\n“Okay,” he said. “Can I hear the riddle?”\\nThe sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very\\nmiddle of the path, and recited:\\n“First think of the person who lives in disguise,\\nWho deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.\\n \\nNext, tell me what’s always the last thing to mend,\\nThe middle of middle and end of the end?\\nAnd finally give me the sound often heard\\nDuring the search for a hard-to-find word.\\nNow string them together, and answer me this,\\nWhich creature would you be unwilling to kiss?”\\nHarry gaped at her.\\n“Could I have it again . . . more slowly?” he asked\\ntentatively.\\nShe blinked at him, smiled, and repeated the poem.\\n“All the clues add up to a creature I wouldn’t want to\\nkiss?” Harry asked.\\nShe merely smiled her mysterious smile. Harry took\\nthat for a “yes.” Harry cast his mind around. There\\nwere plenty of animals he wouldn’t want to kiss; his\\nimmediate thought was a Blast-Ended Skrewt, but\\nsomething told him that wasn’t the answer. He’d have\\nto try and work out the clues. ...\\n“A person in disguise,” Harry muttered, staring at her,\\n“who lies ... er ... that’d be a — an imposter. No,\\nthat’s not my guess! A — a spy? I’ll come back to that\\n. . . could you give me the next clue again, please?”\\nShe repeated the next lines of the poem.\\n“ The last thing to mend,’ ” Harry repeated. “Er ... no\\nidea ... ‘middle of middle’ ... could I have the last bit\\nagain?”\\n \\nShe gave him the last four lines.\\n“ The sound often heard during the search for a hard-\\nto-find word,’ ” said Harry. “Er ... that’d be ... er ...\\nhang on — ‘er’! Er’s a sound!”\\nThe sphinx smiled at him.\\n“Spy ... er ... spy ... er ...” said Harry, pacing up and\\ndown. “A creature I wouldn’t want to kiss ... a spiderl”\\nThe sphinx smiled more broadly. She got up,\\nstretched her front legs, and then moved aside for\\nhim to pass.\\n“Thanks!” said Harry, and, amazed at his own\\nbrilliance, he dashed forward.\\nHe had to be close now, he had to be. ... His wand\\nwas telling him he was bang on course; as long as he\\ndidn’t meet anything too horrible, he might have a\\nchance. ...\\nHarry broke into a run. He had a choice of paths up\\nahead. “Point Mel” he whispered again to his wand,\\nand it spun around and pointed him to the right-\\nhand one. He dashed up this one and saw light\\nahead.\\nThe Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a\\nhundred yards away. Suddenly a dark figure hurtled\\nout onto the path in front of him.\\nCedric was going to get there first. Cedric was\\nsprinting as fast as he could toward the cup, and\\nHarry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was\\nmuch taller, had much longer legs —\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThen Harry saw something immense over a hedge to\\nhis left, moving quickly along a path that intersected\\nwith his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about\\nto run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had\\nnot seen it —\\n“Cedric!” Harry bellowed. “On your left!”\\nCedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past\\nthe thing and avoid colliding with it, but in his haste,\\nhe tripped. Harry saw Cedric’s wand fly out of his\\nhand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and\\nbegan to bear down upon Cedric.\\n“Stupefy\\'.” Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider’s\\ngigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did,\\nhe might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider\\njerked, scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.\\n“ Stupefy ! Impedimenta ! Stupefy !”\\nBut it was no use — the spider was either so large, or\\nso magical, that the spells were doing no more than\\naggravating it. Harry had one horrifying glimpse of\\neight shining black eyes and razor-sharp pincers\\nbefore it was upon him.\\nHe was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling\\nmadly, he tried to kick it; his leg connected with the\\npincers and next moment he was in excruciating\\npain. He could hear Cedric yelling “Stupefy\\'.” too, but\\nhis spell had no more effect than Harry’s — Harry\\nraised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once\\nmore and shouted “ Expelliarmus\\'.”\\nIt worked — the Disarming Spell made the spider\\ndrop him, but that meant that Harry fell twelve feet\\nonto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath\\nhim. Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the\\n \\nspider’s underbelly, as he had done with the skrewt,\\nand shouted “Stupefyl” just as Cedric yelled the same\\nthing.\\nThe two spells combined did what one alone had not:\\nThe spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby\\nhedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy\\nlegs.\\n“Harry!” he heard Cedric shouting. “You all right? Did\\nit fall on you?”\\n“No,” Harry called back, panting. He looked down at\\nhis leg. It was bleeding freely. He could see some sort\\nof thick, gluey secretion from the spider’s pincers on\\nhis torn robes. He tried to get up, but his leg was\\nshaking badly and did not want to support his weight.\\nHe leaned against the hedge, gasping for breath, and\\nlooked around.\\nCedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup,\\nwhich was gleaming behind him.\\n“Take it, then,” Harry panted to Cedric. “Go on, take\\nit. You’re there.”\\nBut Cedric didn’t move. He merely stood there,\\nlooking at Harry. Then he turned to stare at the cup.\\nHarry saw the longing expression on his face in its\\ngolden light. Cedric looked around at Harry again,\\nwho was now holding onto the hedge to support\\nhimself. Cedric took a deep breath.\\n“You take it. You should win. That’s twice you’ve\\nsaved my neck in here.”\\n“That’s not how it’s supposed to work,” Harry said. He\\nfelt angry; his leg was very painful, he was aching all\\nover from trying to throw off the spider, and after all\\n \\nhis efforts, Cedric had beaten him to it, just as he’d\\nbeaten Harry to ask Cho to the ball. “The one who\\nreaches the cup first gets the points. That’s you. I’m\\ntelling you, I’m not going to win any races on this leg.”\\nCedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider,\\naway from the cup, shaking his head.\\n“No,” he said.\\n“Stop being noble,” said Harry irritably. “Just take it,\\nthen we can get out of here.”\\nCedric watched Harry steadying himself, holding tight\\nto the hedge.\\n“You told me about the dragons,” Cedric said. “I\\nwould’ve gone down in the first task if you hadn’t told\\nme what was coming.”\\n“I had help on that too,” Harry snapped, trying to mop\\nup his bloody leg with his robes. “You helped me with\\nthe egg — we’re square.”\\n“I had help on the egg in the first place,” said Cedric.\\n“We’re still square,” said Harry, testing his leg\\ngingerly; it shook violently as he put weight on it; he\\nhad sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped\\nhim.\\n“You should’ve got more points on the second task,”\\nsaid Cedric mulishly. “You stayed behind to get all the\\nhostages. I should’ve done that.”\\n“I was the only one who was thick enough to take that\\nsong seriously!” said Harry bitterly. “Just take the\\ncup!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“No,” said Cedric.\\nHe stepped over the spider’s tangled legs to join\\nHarry, who stared at him. Cedric was serious. He was\\nwalking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff House\\nhadn’t had in centuries.\\n“Go on,” Cedric said. He looked as though this was\\ncosting him every ounce of resolution he had, but his\\nface was set, his arms were folded, he seemed\\ndecided.\\nHarry looked from Cedric to the cup. For one shining\\nmoment, he saw himself emerging from the maze,\\nholding it. He saw himself holding the Triwizard Cup\\naloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw Cho’s face\\nshining with admiration, more clearly than he had\\never seen it before ... and then the picture faded, and\\nhe found himself staring at Cedric’s shadowy,\\nstubborn face.\\n“Both of us,” Harry said.\\n“What?”\\n“Well take it at the same time. It’s still a Hogwarts\\nvictory. We’ll tie for it.”\\nCedric stared at Harry. He unfolded his arms.\\n“You — you sure?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah ... we’ve helped each other\\nout, haven’t we? We both got here. Let’s just take it\\ntogether.”\\nFor a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn’t\\nbelieve his ears; then his face split in a grin.\\n \\n“You’re on,” he said. “Come here.”\\nHe grabbed Harry’s arm below the shoulder and\\nhelped Harry limp toward the plinth where the cup\\nstood. When they had reached it, they both held a\\nhand out over one of the cup’s gleaming handles.\\n“On three, right?” said Harry. “One — two — three — ”\\nHe and Cedric both grasped a handle.\\nInstantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his\\nnavel. His feet had left the ground. He could not\\nunclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was\\npulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling\\ncolor, Cedric at his side.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nFLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE\\nHarry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured\\nleg gave way, and he fell forward; his hand let go of\\nthe Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his head.\\n“Where are we?” he said.\\nCedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his\\nfeet, and they looked around.\\nThey had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they\\nhad obviously traveled miles — perhaps hundreds of\\nmiles — for even the mountains surrounding the\\ncastle were gone. They were standing instead in a\\ndark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a\\nsmall church was visible beyond a large yew tree to\\ntheir right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry\\ncould just make out the outline of a fine old house on\\nthe hillside.\\nCedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up\\nat Harry.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?” he\\nasked.\\n“Nope,” said Harry. He was looking around the\\ngraveyard. It was completely silent and slightly eerie.\\n“Is this supposed to be part of the task?”\\n“I dunno,” said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous.\\n“Wands out, d’you reckon?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the\\nsuggestion rather than him.\\nThey pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking\\naround him. He had, yet again, the strange feeling\\nthat they were being watched.\\n“Someone’s coming,” he said suddenly.\\nSquinting tensely through the darkness, they watched\\nthe figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward\\nthem between the graves. Harry couldn’t make out a\\nface, but from the way it was walking and holding its\\narms, he could tell that it was carrying something.\\nWhoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded\\ncloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And\\n— several paces nearer, the gap between them closing\\nall the time — Harry saw that the thing in the\\nperson’s arms looked like a baby ... or was it merely a\\nbundle of robes?\\nHarry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways\\nat Cedric. Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both\\nturned back to watch the approaching figure.\\nIt stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only\\nsix feet from them. For a second, Harry and Cedric\\nand the short figure simply looked at one another.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nAnd then, without warning, Harry’s scar exploded\\nwith pain. It was agony such as he had never felt in\\nall his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put\\nhis hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on\\nthe ground and he could see nothing at all; his head\\nwas about to split open.\\nFrom far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold\\nvoice say, “Kill the spare.”\\nA swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched\\nthe words to the night: “Avada KedavraV’\\nA blast of green light blazed through Harry’s eyelids,\\nand he heard something heavy fall to the ground\\nbeside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch\\nthat he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of\\nwhat he was about to see, he opened his stinging\\neyes.\\nCedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside\\nhim. He was dead.\\nFor a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared\\ninto Cedric’s face, at his open gray eyes, blank and\\nexpressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at\\nhis half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised.\\nAnd then, before Harry’s mind had accepted what he\\nwas seeing, before he could feel anything but numb\\ndisbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.\\nThe short man in the cloak had put down his bundle,\\nlit his wand, and was dragging Harry toward the\\nmarble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it\\nflickering in the wandlight before he was forced\\naround and slammed against it.\\nTOM RIDDLE\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThe cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords\\naround Harry, tying him from neck to ankles to the\\nheadstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing\\nfrom the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the\\nman hit him — hit him with a hand that had a finger\\nmissing. And Harry realized who was under the hood.\\nIt was Wormtail.\\n“You!” he gasped.\\nBut Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes,\\ndid not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of\\nthe cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably,\\nfumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was\\nbound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn’t\\nmove an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black\\nmaterial from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it\\nroughly into Harry’s mouth; then, without a word, he\\nturned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn’t\\nmake a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had\\ngone; he couldn’t turn his head to see beyond the\\nheadstone; he could see only what was right in front\\nof him.\\nCedric’s body was lying some twenty feet away. Some\\nway beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the\\nTriwizard Cup. Harry’s wand was on the ground at\\nCedric’s feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had\\nthought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the\\ngrave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched\\nit, and his scar seared with pain again . . . and he\\nsuddenly knew that he didn’t want to see what was in\\nthose robes ... he didn’t want that bundle opened. ...\\nHe could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and\\nsaw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass,\\ncircling the headstone where he was tied. Wormtail’s\\nfast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It\\nsounded as though he was forcing something heavy\\n \\nacross the ground. Then he came back within Harry’s\\nrange of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone\\ncauldron to the foot of the grave. It was full of what\\nseemed to be water — Harry could hear it slopping\\naround — and it was larger than any cauldron Harry\\nhad ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a\\nfull-grown man to sit in.\\nThe thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground\\nwas stirring more persistently, as though it was trying\\nto free itself. Now Wormtail was busying himself at\\nthe bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly\\nthere were crackling flames beneath it. The large\\nsnake slithered away into the darkness.\\nThe liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast.\\nThe surface began not only to bubble, but to send out\\nfiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam was\\nthickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending\\nthe fire. The movements beneath the robes became\\nmore agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice\\nagain.\\n“Hurry\\\\”\\nThe whole surface of the water was alight with sparks\\nnow. It might have been encrusted with diamonds.\\n“It is ready, Master.”\\n“Now ...” said the cold voice.\\nWormtail pulled open the robes on the ground,\\nrevealing what was inside them, and Harry let out a\\nyell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking\\nhis mouth.\\nIt was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone\\nand revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind — but\\n \\nworse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail\\nhad been carrying had the shape of a crouched\\nhuman child, except that Harry had never seen\\nanything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly -\\nlooking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs\\nwere thin and feeble, and its face — no child alive\\never had a face like that — flat and snakelike, with\\ngleaming red eyes.\\nThe thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin\\narms, put them around Wormtail’s neck, and\\nWormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood fell back,\\nand Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail’s\\nweak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the\\ncreature to the rim of the cauldron. For one moment,\\nHarry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks\\ndancing on the surface of the potion. And then\\nWormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron;\\nthere was a hiss, and it vanished below the surface;\\nHarry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft\\nthud.\\nLet it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost\\npast endurance, please ... let it drown. ...\\nWormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed\\nfrightened beyond his wits. He raised his wand,\\nclosed his eyes, and spoke to the night.\\n“Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew\\nyour son!”\\nThe surface of the grave at Harry’s feet cracked.\\nHorrified, Harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose\\ninto the air at Wormtail’s command and fell softly into\\nthe cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke\\nand hissed; it sent sparks in all directions and turned\\na vivid, poisonous-looking blue.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nAnd now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long,\\nthin, shining silver dagger from inside his cloak. His\\nvoice broke into petrified sobs.\\n“ Flesh — of the servant — w-willingly given — you will\\n— revive — your master.”\\nHe stretched his right hand out in front of him — the\\nhand with the missing finger. He gripped the dagger\\nvery tightly in his left hand and swung it upward.\\nHarry realized what Wormtail was about to do a\\nsecond before it happened — he closed his eyes as\\ntightly as he could, but he could not block the scream\\nthat pierced the night, that went through Harry as\\nthough he had been stabbed with the dagger too. He\\nheard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail’s\\nanguished panting, then a sickening splash, as\\nsomething was dropped into the cauldron. Harry\\ncouldn’t stand to look ... but the potion had turned a\\nburning red; the light of it shone through Harry’s\\nclosed eyelids...\\nWormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not\\nuntil Harry felt Wormtail’s anguished breath on his\\nface did he realize that Wormtail was right in front of\\nhim.\\n“B-blood of the enemy ... forcibly taken ... you will ...\\nresurrect your foe.”\\nHarry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too\\ntightly. ... Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at\\nthe ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver\\ndagger shaking in Wormtail’s remaining hand. He felt\\nits point penetrate the crook of his right arm and\\nblood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes.\\nWormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled in his\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\npocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry’s cut, so\\nthat a dribble of blood fell into it.\\nHe staggered back to the cauldron with Harry’s blood.\\nHe poured it inside. The liquid within turned,\\ninstantly, a blinding white. Wormtail, his job done,\\ndropped to his knees beside the cauldron, then\\nslumped sideways and lay on the ground, cradling the\\nbleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing.\\nThe cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond\\nsparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it\\nturned all else to velvety blackness. Nothing\\nhappened. ...\\nLet it have drowned, Harry thought, let it have gone\\nwrong. ...\\nAnd then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the\\ncauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam\\nbillowed thickly from the cauldron instead,\\nobliterating everything in front of Harry, so that he\\ncouldn’t see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor\\nhanging in the air. . . It’s gone wrong, he thought . . . it’s\\ndrowned . . . please . . . please let it be dead. . .\\nBut then, through the mist in front of him, he saw,\\nwith an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man,\\ntall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the\\ncauldron.\\n“Robe me,” said the high, cold voice from behind the\\nsteam, and Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still\\ncradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the\\nblack robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached\\nup, and pulled them one-handed over his master’s\\nhead.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nThe thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at\\nHarry . . . and Harry stared back into the face that had\\nhaunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a\\nskull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that\\nwas flat as a snake’s with slits for nostrils ...\\nLord Voldemort had risen again.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE DEATH EATERS\\nVoldemort looked away from Harry and began\\nexamining his own body. His hands were like large,\\npale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own\\nchest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils\\nwere slits, like a cat’s, gleamed still more brightly\\nthrough the darkness. He held up his hands and\\nflexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant.\\nHe took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay\\ntwitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great\\nsnake, which had slithered back into sight and was\\ncircling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of\\nthose unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep\\npocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently\\ntoo; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail,\\nwho was lifted off the ground and thrown against the\\nheadstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of\\nit and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort\\nturned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high,\\ncold, mirthless laugh.\\nWormtail’s robes were shining with blood now; he had\\nwrapped the stump of his arm in them.\\n \\n“My Lord ...” he choked, “my Lord ... you promised ...\\nyou did promise ...”\\n“Hold out your arm,” said Voldemort lazily.\\n“Oh Master ... thank you, Master ...”\\nHe extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort\\nlaughed again.\\n“The other arm, Wormtail.”\\n“Master, please ... please ...”\\nVoldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail’s left\\narm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail’s robes up past\\nhis elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin\\nthere, something like a vivid red tattoo — a skull with\\na snake protruding from its mouth — the image that\\nhad appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup:\\nthe Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully,\\nignoring Wormtail’s uncontrollable weeping.\\n“It is back,” he said softly, “they will all have noticed it\\n... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...”\\nHe pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on\\nWormtail’s arm.\\nThe scar on Harry’s forehead seared with a sharp\\npain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl;\\nVoldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail’s mark,\\nand Harry saw that it had turned jet black.\\nA look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort\\nstraightened up, threw back his head, and stared\\naround at the dark graveyard.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“How many will be brave enough to return when they\\nfeel it?” he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed\\nupon the stars. “And how many will be foolish enough\\nto stay away?”\\nHe began to pace up and down before Harry and\\nWormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while.\\nAfter a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again,\\na cruel smile twisting his snakelike face.\\n“You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late\\nfather,” he hissed softly. “A Muggle and a fool ... very\\nlike your dear mother. But they both had their uses,\\ndid they not? Your mother died to defend you as a\\nchild . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he\\nhas proved himself, in death. ...”\\nVoldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced,\\nlooking all around him as he walked, and the snake\\ncontinued to circle in the grass.\\n“You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My\\nfather lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here\\nin this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned\\nher when she told him what she was. ... He didn’t like\\nmagic, my father . . .\\n“He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before\\nI was even born, Potter, and she died giving birth to\\nme, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage ...\\nbut I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon\\nhim, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle.\\nStill he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to\\ngrave.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Listen to me, reliving family history ...” he said\\nquietly, “why, I am growing quite sentimental. ... But\\nlook, Harry! My true family returns. ...”\\nThe air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks.\\nBetween graves, behind the yew tree, in every\\nshadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them\\nwere hooded and masked. And one by one they moved\\nforward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could\\nhardly believe their eyes. Voldemort stood in silence,\\nwaiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to\\nhis knees, crawled toward Voldemort, and kissed the\\nhem of his black robes.\\n“Master ... Master ...” he murmured.\\nThe Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of\\nthem approaching Voldemort on his knees and\\nkissing his robes, before backing away and standing\\nup, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom\\nRiddle’s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and\\ntwitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps\\nin the circle, as though waiting for more people.\\nVoldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He\\nlooked around at the hooded faces, and though there\\nwas no wind, a rustling seemed to run around the\\ncircle, as though it had shivered.\\n“Welcome, Death Eaters,” said Voldemort quietly.\\n“Thirteen years ... thirteen years since last we met.\\nYet you answer my call as though it were yesterday.\\n... We are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or\\nare we?”\\nHe put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like\\nnostrils widening.\\n“I smell guilt,” he said. “There is a stench of guilt\\nupon the air.”\\n \\nA second shiver ran around the circle, as though each\\nmember of it longed, but did not dare, to step back\\nfrom him.\\n“I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers\\nintact — such prompt appearances! — and I ask\\nmyself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to\\nthe aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal\\nloyalty?”\\nNo one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who\\nwas upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding\\narm.\\n“And I answer myself,” whispered Voldemort, “they\\nmust have believed me broken, they thought I was\\ngone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they\\npleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment.\\n“And then I ask myself, but how could they have\\nbelieved I would not rise again? They, who knew the\\nsteps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal\\ndeath? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of\\nmy power in the times when I was mightier than any\\nwizard living?\\n“And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still\\ngreater power could exist, one that could vanquish\\neven Lord Voldemort ... perhaps they now pay\\nallegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of\\ncommoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus\\nDumbledore?”\\nAt the mention of Dumbledore’s name, the members\\nof the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook\\ntheir heads. Voldemort ignored them.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself\\ndisappointed. ...”\\nOne of the men suddenly flung himself forward,\\nbreaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he\\ncollapsed at Voldemort’s feet.\\n“Master!” he shrieked, “Master, forgive me! Forgive us\\nall!”\\nVoldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.\\n“ Cruciol ”\\nThe Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked;\\nHarry was sure the sound must carry to the houses\\naround. ... Let the police come, he thought desperately\\n... anyone ... anything ...\\nVoldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater\\nlay flat upon the ground, gasping.\\n“Get up, Avery,” said Voldemort softly. “Stand up. You\\nask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget.\\nThirteen long years ... I want thirteen years’\\nrepayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has\\npaid some of his debt already, have you not,\\nWormtail?”\\nHe looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.\\n“You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear\\nof your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail.\\nYou know that, don’t you?”\\n“Yes, Master,” moaned Wormtail, “please, Master ...\\nplease ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Yet you helped return me to my body,” said\\nVoldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the\\nground. “Worthless and traitorous as you are, you\\nhelped me . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his\\nhelpers. ...”\\nVoldemort raised his wand again and whirled it\\nthrough the air. A streak of what looked like molten\\nsilver hung shining in the wand’s wake. Momentarily\\nshapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a\\ngleaming replica of a human hand, bright as\\nmoonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself\\nupon Wormtail’s bleeding wrist.\\nWormtail’s sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing\\nharsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in\\ndisbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly\\nto his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling\\nglove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling,\\npicked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it\\ninto powder.\\n“My Lord,” he whispered. “Master ... it is beautiful ...\\nthank you ... thank you. ...”\\nHe scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the\\nhem of Voldemort’s robes.\\n“May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,” said\\nVoldemort.\\n“No, my Lord ... never, my Lord ...”\\nWormtail stood up and took his place in the circle,\\nstaring at his powerful new hand, his face still\\nshining with tears. Voldemort now approached the\\nman on Wormtail’s right.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Lucius, my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting\\nbefore him. “I am told that you have not renounced\\nthe old ways, though to the world you present a\\nrespectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in\\na spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried\\nto find me, Lucius. ... Your exploits at the Quidditch\\nWorld Cup were fun, I daresay ... but might not your\\nenergies have been better directed toward finding and\\naiding your master?”\\n“My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,” came Lucius\\nMalfoy’s voice swiftly from beneath the hood. “Had\\nthere been any sign from you, any whisper of your\\nwhereabouts, I would have been at your side\\nimmediately, nothing could have prevented me — ”\\n“And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful\\nDeath Eater sent it into the sky last summer?” said\\nVoldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking\\nabruptly. “Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. ... You\\nhave disappointed me. ... I expect more faithful\\nservice in the future.”\\n“Of course, my Lord, of course. ... You are merciful,\\nthank you. ...”\\nVoldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the\\nspace — large enough for two people — that\\nseparated Malfoy and the next man.\\n“The Lestranges should stand here,” said Voldemort\\nquietly. “But they are entombed in Azkaban. They\\nwere faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than\\nrenounce me. ... When Azkaban is broken open, the\\nLestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The\\ndementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ...\\nwe will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all\\nmy devoted servants returned to me, and an army of\\ncreatures whom all fear. ...”\\n \\nHe walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in\\nsilence, but he paused before others and spoke to\\nthem.\\n“Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the\\nMinistry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall\\nhave better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord\\nVoldemort will provide. ...”\\n“Thank you, Master ... thank you,” murmured\\nMacnair.\\n“And here” — Voldemort moved on to the two largest\\nhooded figures — “we have Crabbe . . . you will do\\nbetter this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you,\\nGoyle?”\\nThey bowed clumsily, muttering dully.\\n“Yes, Master ...”\\n“We will, Master. ...”\\n“The same goes for you, Nott,” said Voldemort quietly\\nas he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyle ’s\\nshadow.\\n“My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your\\nmost faithful — ”\\n“That will do,” said Voldemort.\\nHe had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood\\nsurveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he\\ncould see people standing there.\\n“And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three\\ndead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... he\\nwill pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he\\n \\nwill be killed, of course ... and one, who remains my\\nmost faithful servant, and who has already reentered\\nmy service.”\\nThe Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes\\ndart sideways at one another through their masks.\\n“He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was\\nthrough his efforts that our young friend arrived here\\ntonight. ...\\n“Yes,” said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth\\nas the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry’s direction.\\n“Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing\\nparty. One might go so far as to call him my guest of\\nhonor.”\\nThere was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right\\nof Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy’s\\nvoice spoke from under the mask.\\n“Master, we crave to know . . . we beg you to tell us . . .\\nhow you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how\\nyou managed to return to us. ...”\\n“Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,” said Voldemort. “And\\nit begins — and ends — with my young friend here.”\\nHe walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that\\nthe eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of\\nthem. The snake continued to circle.\\n“You know, of course, that they have called this boy\\nmy downfall?” Voldemort said softly, his red eyes\\nupon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that\\nhe almost screamed in agony. “You all know that on\\nthe night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill\\nhim. His mother died in the attempt to save him —\\nand unwittingly provided him with a protection I\\n \\nadmit I had not foreseen. ... I could not touch the\\nboy.”\\nVoldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put\\nit very close to Harry’s cheek.\\n“His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice.\\n. . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I\\nwas foolish to overlook it . . . but no matter. I can\\ntouch him now.”\\nHarry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch\\nhim, and thought his head would burst with the pain.\\nVoldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the\\nfinger away and continued addressing the Death\\nEaters.\\n“I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was\\ndeflected by the woman’s foolish sacrifice, and it\\nrebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain,\\nmy friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I\\nwas ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less\\nthan the meanest ghost ... but still, I was alive. What\\nI was, even I do not know ... I, who have gone further\\nthan anybody along the path that leads to\\nimmortality. You know my goal — to conquer death.\\nAnd now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or\\nmore of my experiments had worked . . . for I had not\\nbeen killed, though the curse should have done it.\\nNevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest\\ncreature alive, and without the means to help myself\\n. . . for I had no body, and every spell that might have\\nhelped me required the use of a wand. ...\\n“I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly,\\nendlessly, second by second, to exist. ... I settled in a\\nfaraway place, in a forest, and I waited. ... Surely, one\\nof my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me . . .\\none of them would come and perform the magic I\\n \\ncould not, to restore me to a body . . . but I waited in\\nvain. ...”\\nThe shiver ran once more around the circle of\\nlistening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence\\nspiral horribly before continuing.\\n“Only one power remained to me. I could possess the\\nbodies of others. But I dared not go where other\\nhumans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors\\nwere still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes\\ninhabited animals — snakes, of course, being my\\npreference — but I was little better off inside them\\nthan as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to\\nperform magic ... and my possession of them\\nshortened their lives; none of them lasted long. ...\\n“Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return\\nseemed assured. A wizard — young, foolish, and\\ngullible — wandered across my path in the forest I\\nhad made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I\\nhad been dreaming of . . . for he was a teacher at\\nDumbledore’s school ... he was easy to bend to my\\nwill ... he brought me back to this country, and after\\na while, I took possession of his body, to supervise\\nhim closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan\\nfailed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer’s Stone. I\\nwas not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted ...\\nthwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ...”\\nSilence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the\\nleaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite\\nmotionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed\\nupon Voldemort, and upon Harry.\\n“The servant died when I left his body, and I was left\\nas weak as ever I had been,” Voldemort continued. “I\\nreturned to my hiding place far away, and I will not\\npretend to you that I didn’t then fear that I might\\n \\nnever regain my powers. ... Yes, that was perhaps my\\ndarkest hour ... I could not hope that I would be sent\\nanother wizard to possess ... and I had given up hope,\\nnow, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had\\nbecome of me. ...”\\nOne or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved\\nuncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice.\\n“And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost\\nabandoned hope, it happened at last ... a servant\\nreturned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his\\nown death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding\\nby those he had once counted friends, and decided to\\nreturn to his master. He sought me in the country\\nwhere it had long been rumored I was hiding . . .\\nhelped, of course, by the rats he met along the way.\\nWormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not,\\nWormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a\\nplace, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided,\\nwhere small animals like themselves had met their\\ndeaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. ...\\n“But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it,\\nWormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the\\nvery forest where he had hoped to find me, he\\nfoolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who\\nshould he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a\\nwitch from the Ministry of Magic.\\n“Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort.\\nThis might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my\\nlast hope for regeneration. But Wormtail — displaying\\na presence of mind I would never have expected from\\nhim — convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him\\non a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her ... he\\nbrought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might\\nhave ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nwildest dreams . . . for — with a little persuasion — she\\nbecame a veritable mine of information.\\n“She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be\\nplayed at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she\\nknew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too\\nwilling to help me, if I could only contact him. She\\ntold me many things . . . but the means I used to break\\nthe Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and\\nwhen I had extracted all useful information from her,\\nher mind and body were both damaged beyond repair.\\nShe had now served her purpose. I could not possess\\nher. I disposed of her.”\\nVoldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes\\nblank and pitiless.\\n“Wormtail’s body, of course, was ill adapted for\\npossession, as all assumed him dead, and would\\nattract far too much attention if noticed. However, he\\nwas the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor\\nwizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the\\ninstructions I gave him, which would return me to a\\nrudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be\\nable to inhabit while awaiting the essential\\ningredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my\\nown invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini,”\\nVoldemort’s red eyes fell upon the continually circling\\nsnake, “a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and\\nthe snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon\\nreturned to an almost human form, and strong\\nenough to travel.\\n“There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer’s Stone\\nanymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have\\nseen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to\\nembrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality.\\nI set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body\\nback again, and my old strength.\\n \\n“I knew that to achieve this — it is an old piece of\\nDark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight — I\\nwould need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of\\nthem was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail?\\nFlesh given by a servant. ...\\n“My father’s bone, naturally, meant that we would\\nhave to come here, where he was buried. But the\\nblood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any\\nwizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who\\nhad hated me ... as so many of them still do. But I\\nknew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more\\npowerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted\\nHarry Potter’s blood. I wanted the blood of the one\\nwho had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . .\\nfor the lingering protection his mother once gave him\\nwould then reside in my veins too. ...\\n“But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been\\nbetter protected than I think even he knows,\\nprotected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago,\\nwhen it fell to him to arrange the boy’s future.\\nDumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the\\nboy’s protection as long as he is in his relations’ care.\\nNot even I can touch him there. ... Then, of course,\\nthere was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I thought his\\nprotection might be weaker there, away from his\\nrelations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong\\nenough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of\\nMinistry wizards. And then, the boy would return to\\nHogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that\\nMuggle-loving fool from morning until night. So how\\ncould I take him?\\n“Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins’s information, of\\ncourse. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at\\nHogwarts, to ensure that the boy’s name was entered\\ninto the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure\\nthat the boy won the tournament — that he touched\\n \\nthe Triwizard Cup first — the cup which my Death\\nEater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring\\nhim here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore’s help and\\nprotection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is\\n... the boy you all believed had been my downfall...”\\nVoldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face\\nHarry. He raised his wand.\\n“Crucio\\\\”\\nIt was pain beyond anything Harry had ever\\nexperienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was\\nsurely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling\\nmadly in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out\\n...to die ...\\nAnd then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the\\nropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort’s\\nfather, looking up into those bright red eyes through\\na kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound\\nof the Death Eaters’ laughter.\\n“You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that\\nthis boy could ever have been stronger than me,” said\\nVoldemort. “But I want there to be no mistake in\\nanybody’s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky\\nchance. And I am now going to prove my power by\\nkilling him, here and now, in front of you all, when\\nthere is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to\\ndie for him. I will give him his chance. He will be\\nallowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt\\nwhich of us is the stronger. Just a little longer,\\nNagini,” he whispered, and the snake glided away\\nthrough the grass to where the Death Eaters stood\\nwatching.\\n“Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his\\nwand.”\\n \\nPRIORI INCANTATEM\\nWormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find\\nhis feet, to support his own weight before the ropes\\nwere untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand,\\npulled out the wad of material gagging Harry, and\\nthen, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying\\nHarry to the gravestone.\\nThere was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might\\nhave considered running for it, but his injured leg\\nshook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave,\\nas the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter\\ncircle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps\\nwhere the missing Death Eaters should have stood\\nwere filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the\\nplace where Cedric’s body lay and returned with\\nHarry’s wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry’s\\nhand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed\\nhis place in the circle of watching Death Eaters.\\n“You have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?”\\nsaid Voldemort softly, his red eyes glinting through\\nthe darkness.\\n \\nAt these words Harry remembered, as though from a\\nformer life, the dueling club at Hogwarts he had\\nattended briefly two years ago. ... All he had learned\\nthere was the Disarming Spell, “ Expelliarmus” ... and\\nwhat use would it be to deprive Voldemort of his\\nwand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by\\nDeath Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one?\\nHe had never learned anything that could possibly fit\\nhim for this. He knew he was facing the thing against\\nwhich Moody had always warned . . . the un-blockable\\nAvada Kedavra curse — and Voldemort was right —\\nhis mother was not here to die for him this time. ...\\nHe was quite unprotected. ...\\n“We bow to each other, Harry,” said Voldemort,\\nbending a little, but keeping his snakelike face\\nupturned to Harry. “Come, the niceties must be\\nobserved. ... Dumbledore would like you to show\\nmanners. ... Bow to death, Harry. ...”\\nThe Death Eaters were laughing again. Voldemort’s\\nlipless mouth was smiling. Harry did not bow. He was\\nnot going to let Voldemort play with him before killing\\nhim ... he was not going to give him that satisfaction.\\n“I said, bow,” Voldemort said, raising his wand — and\\nHarry felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible\\nhand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the\\nDeath Eaters laughed harder than ever.\\n“Very good,” said Voldemort softly, and as he raised\\nhis wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted\\ntoo. “And now you face me, like a man ... straight-\\nbacked and proud, the way your father died. ...\\n“And now — we duel.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nVoldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do\\nanything to defend himself, before he could even\\nmove, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse.\\nThe pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no\\nlonger knew where he was. ... White-hot knives were\\npiercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely\\ngoing to burst with pain, he was screaming more\\nloudly than he’d ever screamed in his life —\\nAnd then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled\\nto his feet; he was shaking as uncontrollably as\\nWormtail had done when his hand had been cut off;\\nhe staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death\\nEaters, and they pushed him away, back toward\\nVoldemort.\\n“A little break,” said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils\\ndilating with excitement, “a little pause . . . That hurt,\\ndidn’t it, Harry? You don’t want me to do that again,\\ndo you?”\\nHarry didn’t answer. He was going to die like Cedric,\\nthose pitiless red eyes were telling him so ... he was\\ngoing to die, and there was nothing he could do about\\nit... but he wasn’t going to play along. He wasn’t going\\nto obey Voldemort ... he wasn’t going to beg. ...\\n“I asked you whether you want me to do that again,”\\nsaid Voldemort softly. “Answer me! ImperioV’\\nAnd Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the\\nsensation that his mind had been wiped of all\\nthought. ... Ah, it was bliss, not to think, it was as\\nthough he were floating, dreaming ... just answer no\\n. . . say no ... just answer no. . . .\\nI will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his\\nhead, I won’t answer. ...\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nJust answer no. ...\\nI won’t do it, I won’t say it. ...\\nJust answer no. ...\\n“I WONT!”\\nAnd these words burst from Harry’s mouth; they\\nechoed through the graveyard, and the dream state\\nwas lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been\\nthrown over him — back rushed the aches that the\\nCruciatus Curse had left all over his body — back\\nrushed the realization of where he was, and what he\\nwas facing. ...\\n“You won’t?” said Voldemort quietly, and the Death\\nEaters were not laughing now. “You won’t say no?\\nHarry, obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before\\nyou die. ... Perhaps another little dose of pain?”\\nVoldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was\\nready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch\\ntraining, he flung himself sideways onto the ground;\\nhe rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort’s\\nfather, and he heard it crack as the curse missed\\nhim.\\n“We are not playing hide-and-seek, Harry,” said\\nVoldemort’s soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the\\nDeath Eaters laughed. “You cannot hide from me.\\nDoes this mean you are tired of our duel? Does this\\nmean that you would prefer me to finish it now,\\nHarry? Come out, Harry . . . come out and play, then\\n...it will be quick ... it might even be painless ... I\\nwould not know ... I have never died. ...”\\nHarry crouched behind the headstone and knew the\\nend had come. There was no hope ... no help to be\\n \\nhad. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he\\nknew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or\\nreason: He was not going to die crouching here like a\\nchild playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die\\nkneeling at Voldemort’s feet ... he was going to die\\nupright like his father, and he was going to die trying\\nto defend himself, even if no defense was possible. ...\\nBefore Voldemort could stick his snakelike face\\naround the headstone, Harry stood up ... he gripped\\nhis wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of\\nhim, and threw himself around the headstone, facing\\nVoldemort.\\nVoldemort was ready. As Harry shouted,\\n“ ExpelliarmusV’ Voldemort cried, “Avada KedavraV’\\nA jet of green light issued from Voldemort’s wand just\\nas a jet of red light blasted from Harry’s — they met\\nin midair — and suddenly Harry’s wand was vibrating\\nas though an electric charge were surging through it;\\nhis hand seized up around it; he couldn’t have\\nreleased it if he’d wanted to — and a narrow beam of\\nlight connected the two wands, neither red nor green,\\nbut bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with\\nhis astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort’s long white\\nfingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking\\nand vibrating.\\nAnd then — nothing could have prepared Harry for\\nthis — he felt his feet lift from the ground. He and\\nVoldemort were both being raised into the air, their\\nwands still connected by that thread of shimmering\\ngolden light. They glided away from the tombstone of\\nVoldemort’s father and then came to rest on a patch\\nof ground that was clear and free of graves. ... The\\nDeath Eaters were shouting; they were asking\\nVoldemort for instructions; they were closing in,\\nreforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort, the\\n \\nsnake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing\\ntheir wands —\\nThe golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort\\nsplintered; though the wands remained connected, a\\nthousand more beams arced high over Harry and\\nVoldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they\\nwere enclosed in a golden, dome-shaped web, a cage\\nof light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like\\njackals, their cries strangely muffled now. ...\\n“Do nothing!” Voldemort shrieked to the Death\\nEaters, and Harry saw his red eyes wide with\\nastonishment at what was happening, saw him\\nfighting to break the thread of light still connecting\\nhis wand with Harry’s; Harry held onto his wand\\nmore tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread\\nremained unbroken. “Do nothing unless I command\\nyou!” Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters.\\nAnd then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the\\nair. ... It was coming from every thread of the light-\\nspun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort. It\\nwas a sound Harry recognized, though he had heard\\nit only once before in his life: phoenix song.\\nIt was the sound of hope to Harry . . . the most\\nbeautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his\\nlife. ... He felt as though the song were inside him\\ninstead of just around him. ... It was the sound he\\nconnected with Dumbledore, and it was almost as\\nthough a friend were speaking in his ear. . . .\\nDon’t break the connection.\\nI know, Harry told the music, I know I mustn’t ... but\\nno sooner had he thought it, than the thing became\\nmuch harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more\\npowerfully than ever . . . and now the beam between\\n \\nhim and Voldemort changed too ... it was as though\\nlarge beads of light were sliding up and down the\\nthread connecting the wands — Harry felt his wand\\ngive a shudder under his hand as the light beads\\nbegan to slide slowly and steadily his way. . . . The\\ndirection of the beam’s movement was now toward\\nhim, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder\\nangrily. ...\\nAs the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harry’s\\nwand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he\\nfeared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead\\nmoved, the harder Harry’s wand vibrated; he was sure\\nhis wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as\\nthough it was about to shatter under his fingers —\\nHe concentrated every last particle of his mind upon\\nforcing the bead back toward Voldemort, his ears full\\nof phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed ... and slowly,\\nvery slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then,\\njust as slowly, they began to move the other way ...\\nand it was Voldemort ’s wand that was vibrating extra-\\nhard now ... Voldemort who looked astonished, and\\nalmost fearful. ...\\nOne of the beads of light was quivering, inches from\\nthe tip of Voldemort’s wand. Harry didn’t understand\\nwhy he was doing it, didn’t know what it might\\nachieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never\\ndone in his life on forcing that bead of light right back\\ninto Voldemort’s wand ... and slowly ... very slowly ...\\nit moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a\\nmoment... and then it connected. ...\\nAt once, Voldemort’s wand began to emit echoing\\nscreams of pain ... then — Voldemort’s red eyes\\nwidened with shock — a dense, smoky hand flew out\\nof the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand\\nhe had made Wormtail ... more shouts of pain ... and\\n \\nthen something much larger began to blossom from\\nVoldemort’s wand tip, a great, grayish something,\\nthat looked as though it were made of the solidest,\\ndensest smoke. ... It was a head ... now a chest and\\narms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory.\\nIf ever Harry might have released his wand from\\nshock, it would have been then, but instinct kept him\\nclutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of\\ngolden light remained unbroken, even though the\\nthick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost? it\\nlooked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of\\nVoldemort’s wand, as though it were squeezing itself\\nout of a very narrow tunnel . . . and this shade of\\nCedric stood up, and looked up and down the golden\\nthread of light, and spoke.\\n“Hold on, Harry,” it said.\\nIts voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at\\nVoldemort . . . his wide red eyes were still shocked . . .\\nhe had no more expected this than Harry had . . . and,\\nvery dimly, Harry heard the frightened yells of the\\nDeath Eaters, prowling around the edges of the\\ngolden dome. ...\\nMore screams of pain from the wand . . . and then\\nsomething else emerged from its tip . . . the dense\\nshadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms\\nand torso ... an old man Harry had seen only in a\\ndream was now pushing himself out of the end of the\\nwand just as Cedric had done ... and his ghost, or his\\nshadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric’s, and\\nsurveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web,\\nand the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning\\non his walking stick. . . .\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K.

You\\nfight him, boy. ...”\\nBut already, yet another head was emerging . . . and\\nthis head, gray as a smoky statue, was a woman’s. ...\\nHarry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep\\nhis wand still, saw her drop to the ground and\\nstraighten up like the others, staring. ...\\nThe shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle\\nbefore her with wide eyes.\\n“Don’t let go, now!” she cried, and her voice echoed\\nlike Cedric’s as though from very far away. “Don’t let\\nhim get you, Harry — don’t let go!”\\nShe and the other two shadowy figures began to pace\\naround the inner walls of the golden web, while the\\nDeath Eaters flitted around the outside of it ... and\\nVoldemort’s dead victims whispered as they circled\\nthe duelers, whispered words of encouragement to\\nHarry, and hissed words Harry couldn’t hear to\\nVoldemort.\\nAnd now another head was emerging from the tip of\\nVoldemort’s wand ... and Harry knew when he saw it\\nwho it would be ... he knew, as though he had\\nexpected it from the moment when Cedric had\\nappeared from the wand . . . knew, because the woman\\nwas the one he’d thought of more than any other\\ntonight. ...\\nThe smoky shadow of a young woman with long hair\\nfell to the ground as Bertha had done, straightened\\nup, and looked at him ... and Harry, his arms shaking\\nmadly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his\\nmother.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Your father’s coming ...” she said quietly. “Hold on\\nfor your father ... it will be all right ... hold on. ...”\\nAnd he came . . . first his head, then his body . . . tall\\nand untidy-haired like Harry, the smoky, shadowy\\nform of James Potter blossomed from the end of\\nVoldemort’s wand, fell to the ground, and\\nstraightened like his wife. He walked close to Harry,\\nlooking down at him, and he spoke in the same\\ndistant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so\\nthat Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his\\nvictims prowled around him, could not hear. . . .\\n“When the connection is broken, we will linger for\\nonly moments . . . but we will give you time . . . you\\nmust get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts\\n... do you understand, Harry?”\\n“Yes,” Harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on\\nhis wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his\\nfingers.\\n“Harry ...” whispered the figure of Cedric, “take my\\nbody back, will you? Take my body back to my\\nparents. ...”\\n“I will,” said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort\\nof holding the wand.\\n“Do it now,” whispered his father’s voice, “be ready to\\nrun ... do it now. ...”\\n“NOW!” Harry yelled; he didn’t think he could have\\nheld on for another moment anyway — he pulled his\\nwand upward with an almighty wrench, and the\\ngolden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the\\nphoenix song died — but the shadowy figures of\\nVoldemort’s victims did not disappear — they were\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nclosing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his\\ngaze —\\nAnd Harry ran as he had never run in his life,\\nknocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he\\npassed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their\\ncurses following him, hearing them hit the\\nheadstones — he was dodging curses and graves,\\npelting toward Cedric’s body, no longer aware of the\\npain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what\\nhe had to do —\\n“Stun him\\\\” he heard Voldemort scream.\\nTen feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble\\nangel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of\\nits wing shatter as the spells hit it. Gripping his wand\\nmore tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel —\\n“Impedimental” he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly\\nover his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him.\\nFrom a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at\\nleast one of them, but there was no time to stop and\\nlook; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard\\nmore wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew\\nover his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to\\ngrab Cedric’s arm —\\n“Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!” shrieked\\nVoldemort.\\nHarry’s hand had closed on Cedric’s wrist; one\\ntombstone stood between him and Voldemort, but\\nCedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of\\nreach —\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K.

Harry\\nsaw his mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his\\nwand.\\n“Acciol” Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the\\nTriwizard Cup.\\nIt flew into the air and soared toward him. Harry\\ncaught it by the handle —\\nHe heard Voldemort’s scream of fury at the same\\nmoment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that\\nmeant the Portkey had worked — it was speeding him\\naway in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along\\nwith him. ... They were going back.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K.

He had closed his eyes while the Portkey\\ntransported him, and he kept them closed now. He\\ndid not move. All the breath seemed to have been\\nknocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly\\nhe felt as though the ground beneath him were\\nswaying like the deck of a ship. To hold himself\\nsteady, he tightened his hold on the two things he\\nwas still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Tri-\\nwizard Cup and Cedric’s body. He felt as though he\\nwould slide away into the blackness gathering at the\\nedges of his brain if he let go of either of them. Shock\\nand exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in\\nthe smell of the grass, waiting ... waiting for someone\\nto do something . . . something to happen . . . and all\\nthe while, his scar burned dully on his forehead. ...\\nA torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there\\nwere voices everywhere, footsteps, screams. ... He\\nremained where he was, his face screwed up against\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K.

HarryV’\\nHe opened his eyes.\\nHe was looking up at the starry sky, and Albus\\nDumbledore was crouched over him. The dark\\nshadows of a crowd of people pressed in around\\nthem, pushing nearer; Harry felt the ground beneath\\nhis head reverberating with their footsteps.\\nHe had come back to the edge of the maze. He could\\nsee the stands rising above him, the shapes of people\\nmoving in them, the stars above.\\nHarry let go of the cup, but he clutched Cedric to him\\neven more tightly. He raised his free hand and seized\\nDumbledore ’s wrist, while Dumbledore ’s face swam in\\nand out of focus.\\n“He’s back,” Harry whispered. “He’s back. Voldemort.”\\n“What’s going on? What’s happened?”\\nThe face of Cornelius Fudge appeared upside down\\nover Harry; it looked white, appalled.\\n“My God — Diggory!” it whispered. “Dumbledore —\\nhe’s dead!”\\nThe words were repeated, the shadowy figures\\npressing in on them gasped it to those around them\\n. . . and then others shouted it — screeched it — into\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K.

Then\\nDumbledore’s face, which was still blurred and\\nmisted, came closer.\\n“Harry, you can’t help him now. It’s over. Let go.”\\n“He wanted me to bring him back,” Harry muttered —\\nit seemed important to explain this. “He wanted me to\\nbring him back to his parents. ...”\\n“That’s right, Harry ... just let go now. ...”\\nDumbledore bent down, and with extraordinary\\nstrength for a man so old and thin, raised Harry from\\nthe ground and set him on his feet. Harry swayed. His\\nhead was pounding. His injured leg would no longer\\nsupport his weight. The crowd around them jostled,\\nfighting to get closer, pressing darkly in on him —\\n“What’s happened?” “What’s wrong with him?”\\n“Dig gory’s dead\\\\”\\n“He’ll need to go to the hospital wing!” Fudge was\\nsaying loudly. “He’s ill, he’s injured — Dumbledore,\\nDiggory’s parents, they’re here, they’re in the stands.\\n“I’ll take Harry, Dumbledore, I’ll take him — ”\\n“No, I would prefer — ”\\n“Dumbledore, Amos Diggory’s running ... he’s coming\\nover. ...

Come on now. ...”\\nSomeone larger and stronger than he was was half\\npulling, half carrying him through the frightened\\ncrowd. Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and\\nshouting as the man supporting him pushed a path\\nthrough them, taking him back to the castle. Across\\nthe lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship,\\nHarry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the\\nman helping him walk.\\n“What happened, Harry?” the man asked at last as he\\nlifted Harry up the stone steps. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk.\\nIt was Mad-Eye Moody.\\n“Cup was a Portkey,” said Harry as they crossed the\\nentrance hall. “Took me and Cedric to a graveyard ...\\nand Voldemort was there ...

Moody’s\\noffice came into sharper focus, and so did Moody\\nhimself. ... He looked as white as Fudge had looked,\\nand both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry’s\\nface.\\n“Voldemort’s back, Harry? You’re sure he’s back? How\\ndid he do it?”\\n“He took stuff from his father’s grave, and from\\nWormtail, and me,” said Harry. His head felt clearer;\\nhis scar wasn’t hurting so badly; he could now see\\nMoody’s face distinctly, even though the office was\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ndark. He could still hear screaming and shouting\\nfrom the distant Quidditch field.\\n“What did the Dark Lord take from you?” said Moody.\\n“Blood,” said Harry, raising his arm. His sleeve was\\nripped where Wormtail’s dagger had torn it.\\nMoody let out his breath in a long, low hiss.\\n“And the Death Eaters? They returned?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “Loads of them ...”\\n“How did he treat them?” Moody asked quietly. “Did\\nhe forgive them?”\\nBut Harry had suddenly remembered. He should have\\ntold Dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway\\n“There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There’s a Death\\nEater here — they put my name in the Goblet of Fire,\\nthey made sure I got through to the end — ”\\nHarry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back\\ndown.\\n“I know who the Death Eater is,” he said quietly.\\n“Karkaroff?” said Harry wildly. “Where is he? Have\\nyou got him? Is he locked up?”\\n“Karkaroff?” said Moody with an odd laugh.\\n“Karkaroff fled tonight, when he felt the Dark Mark\\nburn upon his arm. He betrayed too many faithful\\nsupporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them . . .\\nbut I doubt he will get far. The Dark Lord has ways of\\ntracking his enemies.”\\n \\n“Karkaroff’s gone? He ran away? But then — he didn’t\\nput my name in the goblet?”\\n“No,” said Moody slowly. “No, he didn’t. It was I who\\ndid that.”\\nHarry heard, but didn’t believe.\\n“No, you didn’t,” he said. “You didn’t do that ... you\\ncan’t have done ...”\\n“I assure you I did,” said Moody, and his magical eye\\nswung around and fixed upon the door, and Harry\\nknew he was making sure that there was no one\\noutside it. At the same time, Moody drew out his\\nwand and pointed it at Harry.\\n“He forgave them, then?” he said. “The Death Eaters\\nwho went free? The ones who escaped Azkaban?”\\n“What?” said Harry.\\nHe was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at\\nhim. This was a bad joke, it had to be.\\n“I asked you,” said Moody quietly, “whether he forgave\\nthe scum who never even went to look for him. Those\\ntreacherous cowards who wouldn’t even brave\\nAzkaban for him. The faithless, worthless bits of filth\\nwho were brave enough to cavort in masks at the\\nQuidditch World Cup, but fled at the sight of the Dark\\nMark when I fired it into the sky.”\\n“ You fired . . . What are you talking about ... ?”\\n“I told you, Harry ... I told you. If there’s one thing I\\nhate more than any other, it’s a Death Eater who\\nwalked free. They turned their backs on my master\\nwhen he needed them most. I expected him to punish\\n \\nthem. I expected him to torture them. Tell me he hurt\\nthem, Harry. ...” Moody’s face was suddenly lit with\\nan insane smile. “Tell me he told them that I, I alone\\nremained faithful . . . prepared to risk everything to\\ndeliver to him the one thing he wanted above all ...\\nyou.”\\n“You didn’t ... it — it can’t be you. ...”\\n“Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire, under the\\nname of a different school? I did. Who frightened off\\nevery person I thought might try to hurt you or\\nprevent you from winning the tournament? I did. Who\\nnudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons? I did.\\nWho helped you see the only way you could beat the\\ndragon? I did.”\\nMoody’s magical eye had now left the door. It was\\nfixed upon Harry. His lopsided mouth leered more\\nwidely than ever.\\n“It hasn’t been easy, Harry, guiding you through these\\ntasks without arousing suspicion. I have had to use\\nevery ounce of cunning I possess, so that my hand\\nwould not be detectable in your success. Dumbledore\\nwould have been very suspicious if you had managed\\neverything too easily. As long as you got into that\\nmaze, preferably with a decent head start — then, I\\nknew, I would have a chance of getting rid of the\\nother champions and leaving your way clear. But I\\nalso had to contend with your stupidity. The second\\ntask . . . that was when I was most afraid we would\\nfail. I was keeping watch on you, Potter. I knew you\\nhadn’t worked out the egg’s clue, so I had to give you\\nanother hint — ”\\n“You didn’t,” Harry said hoarsely. “Cedric gave me the\\nclue — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Who told Cedric to open it underwater? I did. I\\ntrusted that he would pass the information on to you.\\nDecent people are so easy to manipulate, Potter. I was\\nsure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him\\nabout the dragons, and so he did. But even then,\\nPotter, even then you seemed likely to fail. I was\\nwatching all the time ... all those hours in the library.\\nDidn’t you realize that the book you needed was in\\nyour dormitory all along? I planted it there early on, I\\ngave it to the Longbottom boy, don’t you remember?\\nMagical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. It would\\nhave told you all you needed to know about gillyweed.\\nI expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could\\nfor help. Longbottom would have told you in an\\ninstant. But you did not ... you did not. ... You have a\\nstreak of pride and independence that might have\\nruined all.\\n“So what could I do? Feed you information from\\nanother innocent source. You told me at the Yule Ball\\na house-elf called Dobby had given you a Christmas\\npresent. I called the elf to the staffroom to collect\\nsome robes for cleaning. I staged a loud conversation\\nwith Professor McGonagall about the hostages who\\nhad been taken, and whether Potter would think to\\nuse gillyweed. And your little elf friend ran straight to\\nSnape’s office and then hurried to find you. ...”\\nMoody’s wand was still pointing directly at Harry’s\\nheart. Over his shoulder, foggy shapes were moving in\\nthe Foe-Glass on the wall.\\n“You were so long in that lake, Potter, I thought you\\nhad drowned. But luckily, Dumbledore took your\\nidiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it. I\\nbreathed again.\\n“You had an easier time of it than you should have in\\nthat maze tonight, of course,” said Moody. “I was\\n \\npatrolling around it, able to see through the outer\\nhedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way.\\nI Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed. I put the\\nImperius Curse on Krum, so that he would finish\\nDiggory and leave your path to the cup clear.”\\nHarry stared at Moody. He just didn’t see how this\\ncould be. ... Dumbledore’s friend, the famous Auror\\n. . . the one who had caught so many Death Eaters . . .\\nIt made no sense ... no sense at all. ...\\nThe foggy shapes in the Foe-Glass were sharpening,\\nhad become more distinct. Harry could see the\\noutlines of three people over Moody’s shoulder,\\nmoving closer and closer. But Moody wasn’t watching\\nthem. His magical eye was upon Harry.\\n“The Dark Lord didn’t manage to kill you, Potter, and\\nhe so wanted to,” whispered Moody. “Imagine how he\\nwill reward me when he finds I have done it for him. I\\ngave you to him — the thing he needed above all to\\nregenerate — and then I killed you for him. I will be\\nhonored beyond all other Death Eaters. I will be his\\ndearest, his closest supporter ... closer than a son. ...”\\nMoody’s normal eye was bulging, the magical eye\\nfixed upon Harry. The door was barred, and Harry\\nknew he would never reach his own wand in time. ...\\n“The Dark Lord and I,” said Moody, and he looked\\ncompletely insane now, towering over Harry, leering\\ndown at him, “have much in common. Both of us, for\\ninstance, had very disappointing fathers ... very\\ndisappointing indeed. Both of us suffered the\\nindignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers.\\nAnd both of us had the pleasure . . . the very great\\npleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the\\ncontinued rise of the Dark Order!”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You’re mad,” Harry said — he couldn’t stop himself\\n— “you’re mad!”\\n“Mad, am I?” said Moody, his voice rising\\nuncontrollably. “We’ll see! We’ll see who’s mad, now\\nthat the Dark Lord has returned, with me at his side!\\nHe is back, Harry Potter, you did not conquer him —\\nand now — I conquer you!”\\nMoody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; Harry\\nplunged his own hand into his robes —\\n“Stupefy\\\\” There was a blinding flash of red light, and\\nwith a great splintering and crashing, the door of\\nMoody’s office was blasted apart —\\nMoody was thrown backward onto the office floor.\\nHarry, still staring at the place where Moody’s face\\nhad been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape,\\nand Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of\\nthe Foe-Glass. He looked around and saw the three of\\nthem standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front,\\nhis wand outstretched.\\nAt that moment, Harry fully understood for the first\\ntime why people said Dumbledore was the only wizard\\nVoldemort had ever feared. The look upon\\nDumbledore ’s face as he stared down at the\\nunconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more\\nterrible than Harry could have ever imagined. There\\nwas no benign smile upon Dumbledore ’s face, no\\ntwinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There was\\ncold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of\\npower radiated from Dumbledore as though he were\\ngiving off burning heat.\\nHe stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath\\nMoody’s unconscious body, and kicked him over onto\\nhis back, so that his face was visible. Snape followed\\n \\nhim, looking into the Foe-Glass, where his own face\\nwas still visible, glaring into the room. Professor\\nMcGonagall went straight to Harry.\\n“Come along, Potter,” she whispered. The thin line of\\nher mouth was twitching as though she was about to\\ncry. “Come along ... hospital wing ...”\\n“No,” said Dumbledore sharply.\\n“Dumbledore, he ought to — look at him — he’s been\\nthrough enough tonight — ”\\n“He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to\\nunderstand,” said Dumbledore curtly. “Understanding\\nis the first step to acceptance, and only with\\nacceptance can there be recovery. He needs to know\\nwho has put him through the ordeal he has suffered\\ntonight, and why.”\\n“Moody,” Harry said. He was still in a state of\\ncomplete disbelief. “How can it have been Moody?”\\n“This is not Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore quietly.\\n“You have never known Alastor Moody. The real\\nMoody would not have removed you from my sight\\nafter what happened tonight. The moment he took\\nyou, I knew — and I followed.”\\nDumbledore bent down over Moody’s limp form and\\nput a hand inside his robes. He pulled out Moody’s\\nhip flask and a set of keys on a ring. Then he turned\\nto Professors McGonagall and Snape.\\n“Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion\\nyou possess, and then go down to the kitchens and\\nbring up the house-elf called Winky. Minerva, kindly\\ngo down to Hagrid’s house, where you will find a large\\nblack dog sitting in the pumpkin patch. Take the dog\\n \\nup to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly,\\nthen come back here.”\\nIf either Snape or McGonagall found these\\ninstructions peculiar, they hid their confusion. Both\\nturned at once and left the office. Dumbledore walked\\nover to the trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key\\nin the lock, and opened it. It contained a mass of\\nspell-books. Dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a\\nsecond key in the second lock, and opened the trunk\\nagain. The spellbooks had vanished; this time it\\ncontained an assortment of broken Sneako-scopes,\\nsome parchment and quills, and what looked like a\\nsilvery Invisibility Cloak. Harry watched, astounded,\\nas Dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and\\nsixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the\\ntrunk, and each time revealing different contents.\\nThen he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw\\nopen the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.\\nHe was looking down into a kind of pit, an\\nunderground room, and lying on the floor some ten\\nfeet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in\\nappearance, was the real Mad-Eye Moody. His\\nwooden leg was gone, the socket that should have\\nheld the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid,\\nand chunks of his grizzled hair were missing. Harry\\nstared, thunderstruck, between the sleeping Moody in\\nthe trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the\\nfloor of the office.\\nDumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself,\\nand fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping\\nMoody. He bent over him.\\n“Stunned — controlled by the Imperius Curse — very\\nweak,” he said. “Of course, they would have needed to\\nkeep him alive. Harry, throw down the imposter’s\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ncloak — he’s freezing. Madam Pomfrey will need to see\\nhim, but he seems in no immediate danger.”\\nHarry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody\\nin the cloak, tucked it around him, and clambered\\nout of the trunk again. Then he picked up the hip\\nflask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and\\nturned it over. A thick glutinous liquid splattered onto\\nthe office floor.\\n“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see\\nthe simplicity of it, and the brilliance. For Moody\\nnever does drink except from his hip flask, he’s well\\nknown for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep\\nthe real Moody close by, so that he could continue\\nmaking the potion. You see his hair ...” Dumbledore\\nlooked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The\\nimposter has been cutting it off all year, see where it\\nis uneven? But I think, in the excitement of tonight,\\nour fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as\\nfrequently as he should have done ... on the hour . . .\\nevery hour. ... We shall see.”\\nDumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat\\ndown upon it, his eyes fixed upon the unconscious\\nMoody on the floor. Harry stared at him too. Minutes\\npassed in silence. ...\\nThen, before Harry’s very eyes, the face of the man on\\nthe floor began to change. The scars were\\ndisappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the\\nmangled nose became whole and started to shrink.\\nThe long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing\\ninto the scalp and turning the color of straw.\\nSuddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away\\nas a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the\\nmagical eyeball had popped out of the man’s face as a\\nreal eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and\\ncontinued to swivel in every direction.\\n \\nHarry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned,\\nslightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair. He knew who\\nhe was. He had seen him in Dumbledore’s Pensieve,\\nhad watched him being led away from court by the\\ndementors, trying to convince Mr. Crouch that he was\\ninnocent . . . but he was lined around the eyes now\\nand looked much older. . . .\\nThere were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor.\\nSnape had returned with Winky at his heels.\\nProfessor McGonagall was right behind them.\\n“Crouch!” Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway.\\n“Barty Crouch!”\\n“Good heavens,” said Professor McGonagall, stopping\\ndead and staring down at the man on the floor.\\nFilthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape’s legs.\\nHer mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing\\nshriek.\\n“Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?”\\nShe flung herself forward onto the young man’s chest.\\n“You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed\\nMaster’s son!”\\n“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore.\\n“Step aside, please. Severus, you have the potion?”\\nSnape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of\\ncompletely clear liquid: the Veritaserum with which\\nhe had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got up,\\nbent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a\\nsitting position against the wall beneath the Foe-\\nGlass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape,\\nand McGonagall were still glaring down upon them\\n \\nall. Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her\\nhands over her face. Dumbledore forced the man’s\\nmouth open and poured three drops inside it. Then\\nhe pointed his wand at the man’s chest and said,\\n“Rennervate.”\\nCrouch’s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his\\ngaze unfocused. Dumbledore knelt before him, so that\\ntheir faces were level.\\n“Can you hear me?” Dumbledore asked quietly.\\nThe man’s eyelids flickered.\\n“Yes,” he muttered.\\n“I would like you to tell us,” said Dumbledore softly,\\n“how you came to be here. How did you escape from\\nAzkaban?”\\nCrouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began\\nto speak in a flat, expressionless voice.\\n“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She\\npersuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to\\nher. He loved her as he had never loved me. He\\nagreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draft of\\nPolyjuice Potion containing one of my mother’s hairs.\\nShe took a draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of\\nmy hairs. We took on each other’s appearance.”\\nWinky was shaking her head, trembling.\\n“Say no more, Master Barty, say no more, you is\\ngetting your father into trouble!”\\nBut Crouch took another deep breath and continued\\nin the same flat voice.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy,\\none dying person entering Azkaban. They sensed one\\nhealthy, one dying person leaving it. My father\\nsmuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case\\nany prisoners were watching through their doors.\\n“My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban.\\nShe was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the\\nend. She was buried under my name and bearing my\\nappearance. Everyone believed her to be me.”\\nThe man’s eyelids flickered.\\n“And what did your father do with you, when he had\\ngot you home?” said Dumbledore quietly.\\n“Staged my mother’s death. A quiet, private funeral.\\nThat grave is empty. The house-elf nursed me back to\\nhealth. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be\\ncontrolled. My father had to use a number of spells to\\nsubdue me. When I had recovered my strength, I\\nthought only of finding my master ... of returning to\\nhis service.”\\n“How did your father subdue you?” said Dumbledore.\\n“The Imperius Curse,” Crouch said. “I was under my\\nfather’s control. I was forced to wear an Invisibility\\nCloak day and night. I was always with the house-elf.\\nShe was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She\\npersuaded my father to give me occasional treats.\\nRewards for my good behavior.”\\n“Master Barty, Master Barty,” sobbed Winky through\\nher hands. “You isn’t ought to tell them, we is getting\\nin trouble. ...”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?”\\nsaid Dumbledore softly. “Did anyone know except\\nyour father and the house-elf?”\\n“Yes,” said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. “A\\nwitch in my father’s office. Bertha Jorkins. She came\\nto the house with papers for my father’s signature. He\\nwas not at home. Winky showed her inside and\\nreturned to the kitchen, to me. But Bertha Jorkins\\nheard Winky talking to me. She came to investigate.\\nShe heard enough to guess who was hiding under the\\nInvisibility Cloak. My father arrived home. She\\nconfronted him. He put a very powerful Memory\\nCharm on her to make her forget what she’d found\\nout. Too powerful. He said it damaged her memory\\npermanently.”\\n“Why is she coming to nose into my master’s private\\nbusiness?” sobbed Winky. “Why isn’t she leaving us\\nbe?”\\n“Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,” said\\nDumbledore.\\n“Winky talked my father into it,” said Crouch, still in\\nthe same monotonous voice. “She spent months\\npersuading him. I had not left the house for years. I\\nhad loved Quidditch. Let him go, she said. He will be\\nin his Invisibility Cloak. He can watch. Let him smell\\nfresh air for once. She said my mother would have\\nwanted it. She told my father that my mother had\\ndied to give me freedom. She had not saved me for a\\nlife of imprisonment. He agreed in the end.\\n“It was carefully planned. My father led me and Winky\\nup to the Top Box early in the day. Winky was to say\\nthat she was saving a seat for my father. I was to sit\\nthere, invisible. When everyone had left the box, we\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nwould emerge. Winky would appear to be alone.\\nNobody would ever know.\\n“But Winky didn’t know that I was growing stronger. I\\nwas starting to fight my father’s Imperius Curse.\\nThere were times when I was almost myself again.\\nThere were brief periods when I seemed outside his\\ncontrol. It happened, there, in the Top Box. It was like\\nwaking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in\\npublic, in the middle of the match, and I saw, in front\\nof me, a wand sticking out of a boy’s pocket. I had not\\nbeen allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole it.\\nWinky didn’t know. Winky is frightened of heights.\\nShe had her face hidden.”\\n“Master Barty, you bad boy!” whispered Winky, tears\\ntrickling between her fingers.\\n“So you took the wand,” said Dumbledore, “and what\\ndid you do with it?”\\n“We went back to the tent,” said Crouch. “Then we\\nheard them. We heard the Death Eaters. The ones\\nwho had never been to Azkaban. The ones who had\\nnever suffered for my master. They had turned their\\nbacks on him. They were not enslaved, as I was. They\\nwere free to seek him, but they did not. They were\\nmerely making sport of Muggles. The sound of their\\nvoices awoke me. My mind was clearer than it had\\nbeen in years. I was angry. I had the wand. I wanted\\nto attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My\\nfather had left the tent; he had gone to free the\\nMuggles. Winky was afraid to see me so angry. She\\nused her own brand of magic to bind me to her. She\\npulled me from the tent, pulled me into the forest,\\naway from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her back. I\\nwanted to return to the campsite. I wanted to show\\nthose Death Eaters what loyalty to the Dark Lord\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nmeant, and to punish them for their lack of it. I used\\nthe stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky.\\n“Ministry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells\\neverywhere. One of the spells came through the trees\\nwhere Winky and I stood. The bond connecting us\\nwas broken. We were both Stunned.\\n“When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must\\nbe nearby. He searched the bushes where she had\\nbeen found and felt me lying there. He waited until\\nthe other Ministry members had left the forest. He put\\nme back under the Imperius Curse and took me\\nhome. He dismissed Winky. She had failed him. She\\nhad let me acquire a wand. She had almost let me\\nescape.”\\nWinky let out a wail of despair.\\n“Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And\\nthen ... and then ...” Crouch’s head rolled on his\\nneck, and an insane grin spread across his face. “My\\nmaster came for me.\\n“He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of\\nhis servant Wormtail. My master had found out that I\\nwas still alive. He had captured Bertha Jorkins in\\nAlbania. He had tortured her. She told him a great\\ndeal. She told him about the Triwizard Tournament.\\nShe told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to teach\\nat Hogwarts. He tortured her until he broke through\\nthe Memory Charm my father had placed upon her.\\nShe told him I had escaped from Azkaban. She told\\nhim my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from\\nseeking my master. And so my master knew that I\\nwas still his faithful servant — perhaps the most\\nfaithful of all. My master conceived a plan, based\\nupon the information Bertha had given him. He\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nneeded me. He arrived at our house near midnight.\\nMy father answered the door.”\\nThe smile spread wider over Crouch’s face, as though\\nrecalling the sweetest memory of his life. Winky’s\\npetrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers.\\nShe seemed too appalled to speak.\\n“It was very quick. My father was placed under the\\nImperius Curse by my master. Now my father was the\\none imprisoned, controlled. My master forced him to\\ngo about his business as usual, to act as though\\nnothing was wrong. And I was released. I awoke. I\\nwas myself again, alive as I hadn’t been in years.”\\n“And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?” said\\nDumbledore.\\n“He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything\\nfor him. I was ready. It was my dream, my greatest\\nambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He\\ntold me he needed to place a faithful servant at\\nHogwarts. A servant who would guide Harry Potter\\nthrough the Triwizard Tournament without appearing\\nto do so. A servant who would watch over Harry\\nPotter. Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn\\nthe cup into a Portkey, which would take the first\\nperson to touch it to my master. But first — ”\\n“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His\\nblue eyes were blazing, though his voice remained\\ncalm.\\n“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice\\nPotion beforehand. We journeyed to his house. Moody\\nput up a struggle. There was a commotion. We\\nmanaged to subdue him just in time. Forced him into\\na compartment of his own magical trunk. Took some\\nof his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I\\n \\nbecame Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I\\nwas ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to\\nsort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance. I\\nmade the dustbins move around the yard. I told\\nArthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard,\\nwho had set off the dustbins. Then I packed up\\nMoody’s clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the\\ntrunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept\\nhim alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be\\nable to question him. To find out about his past, learn\\nhis habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore. I\\nalso needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion. The\\nother ingredients were easy. I stole boom-slang skin\\nfrom the dungeons. When the Potions master found\\nme in his office, I said I was under orders to search\\nit.”\\n“And what became of Wormtail after you attacked\\nMoody?” said Dumbledore.\\n“Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my\\nfather’s house, and to keep watch over my father.”\\n“But your father escaped,” said Dumbledore.\\n“Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius\\nCurse just as I had done. There were periods when he\\nknew what was happening. My master decided it was\\nno longer safe for my father to leave the house. He\\nforced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He\\nmade him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail\\nneglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My\\nfather escaped. My master guessed that he was\\nheading for Hogwarts. My father was going to tell\\nDumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to\\nadmit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.\\n“My master sent me word of my father’s escape. He\\ntold me to stop him at all costs. So I waited and\\n \\nwatched. I used the map I had taken from Harry\\nPotter. The map that had almost mined everything.”\\n“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”\\n“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter\\nsaw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice\\nPotion from Snape’s office one night. He thought I was\\nmy father. We have the same first name. I took the\\nmap from Potter that night. I told him my father\\nhated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was\\nafter Snape.\\n“For a week I waited for my father to arrive at\\nHogwarts. At last, one evening, the map showed my\\nfather entering the grounds. I pulled on my Invisibility\\nCloak and went down to meet him. He was walking\\naround the edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and\\nKrum. I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my master\\nneeded him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned\\nKrum. I killed my father.”\\n“iVoooo!” wailed Winky. “Master Barty, Master Barty,\\nwhat is you saying?”\\n“You killed your father,” Dumbledore said, in the\\nsame soft voice. “What did you do with the body?”\\n“Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the\\nInvisibility Cloak. I had the map with me. I watched\\nPotter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore\\njoined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore\\nout of the castle. I walked back out of the forest,\\ndoubled around behind them, went to meet them. I\\ntold Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come.\\n“Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I\\nwent back to my father’s body. Watched the map.\\nWhen everyone was gone, I Transfigured my father’s\\n \\nbody. He became a bone ... I buried it, while wearing\\nthe Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front\\nof Hagrid’s cabin.”\\nThere was complete silence now, except for Winky’s\\ncontinued sobs. Then Dumbledore said, “And tonight\\n“I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze\\nbefore dinner,” whispered Barty Crouch. “Turned it\\ninto a Portkey. My master’s plan worked. He is\\nreturned to power and I will be honored by him\\nbeyond the dreams of wizards.”\\nThe insane smile lit his features once more, and his\\nhead drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and\\nsobbed at his side.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE PARTING OF THE WAYS\\nDumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty\\nCrouch for a moment with disgust on his face. Then\\nhe raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it,\\nropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch,\\nbinding him tightly. He turned to Professor\\nMcGonagall.\\n“Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I\\ntake Harry upstairs?”\\n“Of course,” said Professor McGonagall. She looked\\nslightly nauseous, as though she had just watched\\nsomeone being sick. However, when she drew out her\\nwand and pointed it at Barty Crouch, her hand was\\nquite steady.\\n“Severus” — Dumbledore turned to Snape — “please\\ntell Madam Pomfrey to come down here; we need to\\nget Alastor Moody into the hospital wing. Then go\\ndown into the grounds, find Cornelius Fudge, and\\nbring him up to this office. He will undoubtedly want\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nto question Crouch himself. Tell him I will be in the\\nhospital wing in half an hour’s time if he needs me.”\\nSnape nodded silently and swept out of the room.\\n“Harry?” Dumbledore said gently.\\nHarry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg,\\nwhich he had not noticed all the time he had been\\nlistening to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He\\nalso realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore\\ngripped his arm and helped him out into the dark\\ncorridor.\\n“I want you to come up to my office first, Harry,” he\\nsaid quietly as they headed up the passageway.\\n“Sirius is waiting for us there.”\\nHarry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of\\ncomplete unreality were upon him, but he did not\\ncare; he was even glad of it. He didn’t want to have to\\nthink about anything that had happened since he had\\nfirst touched the Triwizard Cup. He didn’t want to\\nhave to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as\\nphotographs, which kept flashing across his mind.\\nMad-Eye Moody, inside the trunk. Wormtail, slumped\\non the ground, cradling his stump of an arm.\\nVoldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron. Cedric\\n. . . dead . . . Cedric, asking to be returned to his\\nparents. ...\\n“Professor,” Harry mumbled, “where are Mr. and Mrs.\\nDiggory?”\\n“They are with Professor Sprout,” said Dumbledore.\\nHis voice, which had been so calm throughout the\\ninterrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very slightly for\\nthe first time. “She was Head of Cedric’s house, and\\nknew him best.”\\n \\nThey had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore\\ngave the password, it sprang aside, and he and Harry\\nwent up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door.\\nDumbledore pushed it open. Sirius was standing\\nthere. His face was white and gaunt as it had been\\nwhen he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment,\\nhe had crossed the room.\\n“Harry, are you all right? I knew it — I knew\\nsomething like this — what happened?”\\nHis hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in\\nfront of the desk.\\n“What happened?” he asked more urgently.\\nDumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty\\nCrouch had said. Harry was only half listening. So\\ntired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted\\nnothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours\\nand hours, until he fell asleep and didn’t have to\\nthink or feel anymore.\\nThere was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix\\nhad left his perch, flown across the office, and landed\\non Harry’s knee.\\n“ ’Lo, Fawkes,” said Harry quietly. He stroked the\\nphoenix’s beautiful scarlet-and-gold plumage. Fawkes\\nblinked peacefully up at him. There was something\\ncomforting about his warm weight.\\nDumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite\\nHarry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who\\navoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to question\\nhim. He was going to make Harry relive everything.\\n“I need to know what happened after you touched the\\nPortkey in the maze, Harry,” said Dumbledore.\\n \\n“We can leave that till morning, can’t we,\\nDumbledore?” said Sirius harshly. He had put a hand\\non Harry’s shoulder. “Let him have a sleep. Let him\\nrest.”\\nHarry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but\\nDumbledore took no notice of Sirius’s words. He\\nleaned forward toward Harry. Very unwillingly, Harry\\nraised his head and looked into those blue eyes.\\n“If I thought I could help you,” Dumbledore said\\ngently, “by putting you into an enchanted sleep and\\nallowing you to postpone the moment when you\\nwould have to think about what has happened\\ntonight, I would do it. But I know better. Numbing the\\npain for a while will make it worse when you finally\\nfeel it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I\\ncould have expected of you. I ask you to demonstrate\\nyour courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what\\nhappened.”\\nThe phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It\\nshivered in the air, and Harry felt as though a drop of\\nhot liquid had slipped down his throat into his\\nstomach, warming him, and strengthening him.\\nHe took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he\\nspoke, visions of everything that had passed that\\nnight seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the\\nsparkling surface of the potion that had revived\\nVoldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating\\nbetween the graves around them; he saw Cedric’s\\nbody, lying on the ground beside the cup.\\nOnce or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to\\nsay something, his hand still tight on Harry’s\\nshoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop\\nhim, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier\\nto keep going now he had started. It was even a relief;\\n \\nhe felt almost as though something poisonous were\\nbeing extracted from him. It was costing him every bit\\nof determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed\\nthat once he had finished, he would feel better.\\nWhen Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with\\nthe dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement\\nexclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that\\nHarry started. Dumbledore walked around the desk\\nand told Harry to stretch out his arm. Harry showed\\nthem both the place where his robes were torn and\\nthe cut beneath them.\\n“He said my blood would make him stronger than if\\nhe’d used someone else’s,” Harry told Dumbledore.\\n“He said the protection my — my mother left in me —\\nhe’d have it too. And he was right — he could touch\\nme without hurting himself, he touched my face.”\\nFor a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam\\nof something like triumph in Dumbledore ’s eyes. But\\nnext second, Harry was sure he had imagined it, for\\nwhen Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind\\nthe desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had\\never seen him.\\n“Very well,” he said, sitting down again. “Voldemort\\nhas overcome that particular barrier. Harry, continue,\\nplease.”\\nHarry went on; he explained how Voldemort had\\nemerged from the cauldron, and told them all he\\ncould remember of Voldemort’s speech to the Death\\nEaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him,\\nreturned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.\\nBut when he reached the part where the golden beam\\nof light had connected his and Voldemort’s wands, he\\nfound his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking,\\n \\nbut the memories of what had come out of\\nVoldemort’s wand were flooding into his mind. He\\ncould see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha\\nJorkins ... his father ... his mother ...\\nHe was glad when Sirius broke the silence.\\n“The wands connected?” he said, looking from Harry\\nto Dumbledore. “Why?”\\nHarry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face\\nthere was an arrested look.\\n“Priori Incantatem,” he muttered.\\nHis eyes gazed into Harry’s and it was almost as\\nthough an invisible beam of understanding shot\\nbetween them.\\n“The Reverse Spell effect?” said Sirius sharply.\\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore. “Harry’s wand and\\nVoldemort’s wand share cores. Each of them contains\\na feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This\\nphoenix, in fact,” he added, and he pointed at the\\nscarlet-and-gold bird, perching peacefully on Harry’s\\nknee.\\n“My wand’s feather came from Fawkes?” Harry said,\\namazed.\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell\\nme you had bought the second wand, the moment\\nyou left his shop four years ago.”\\n“So what happens when a wand meets its brother?”\\nsaid Sirius.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“They will not work properly against each other,” said\\nDumbledore. “If, however, the owners of the wands\\nforce the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will\\ntake place. One of the wands will force the other to\\nregurgitate spells it has performed — in reverse. The\\nmost recent first ... and then those which preceded it.\\nHe looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.\\n“Which means,” said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes\\nupon Harry’s face, “that some form of Cedric must\\nhave reappeared.”\\nHarry nodded again.\\n“Diggory came back to life?” said Sirius sharply.\\n“No spell can reawaken the dead,” said Dumbledore\\nheavily. “All that would have happened is a kind of\\nreverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would\\nhave emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?”\\n“He spoke to me,” Harry said. He was suddenly\\nshaking again. “The ... the ghost Cedric, or whatever\\nhe was, spoke.”\\n“An echo,” said Dumbledore, “which retained Cedric’s\\nappearance and character. I am guessing other such\\nforms appeared ... less recent victims of Voldemort’s\\nwand. ...”\\n“An old man,” Harry said, his throat still constricted.\\n“Bertha Jorkins. And ...”\\n“Your parents?” said Dumbledore quietly.\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nSirius’s grip on Harry’s shoulder was now so tight it\\nwas painful.\\n“The last murders the wand performed,” said\\nDumbledore, nodding. “In reverse order. More would\\nhave appeared, of course, had you maintained the\\nconnection. Very well, Harry, these echoes, these\\nshadows . . . what did they do?”\\nHarry described how the figures that had emerged\\nfrom the wand had prowled the edges of the golden\\nweb, how Voldemort had seemed to fear them, how\\nthe shadow of Harry’s father had told him what to do,\\nhow Cedric’s had made its final request.\\nAt this point, Harry found he could not continue. He\\nlooked around at Sirius and saw that he had his face\\nin his hands.\\nHarry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left\\nhis knee. The phoenix had fluttered to the floor. It\\nwas resting its beautiful head against Harry’s injured\\nleg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes\\nonto the wound left by the spider. The pain vanished.\\nThe skin mended. His leg was repaired.\\n“I will say it again,” said Dumbledore as the phoenix\\nrose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch\\nbeside the door. “You have shown bravery beyond\\nanything I could have expected of you tonight, Harry.\\nYou have shown bravery equal to those who died\\nfighting Voldemort at the height of his powers. You\\nhave shouldered a grown wizard’s burden and found\\nyourself equal to it — and you have now given us all\\nthat we have a right to expect. You will come with me\\nto the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to\\nthe dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some\\npeace ... Sirius, would you like to stay with him?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nSirius nodded and stood up. He transformed back\\ninto the great black dog and walked with Harry and\\nDumbledore out of the office, accompanying them\\ndown a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.\\nWhen Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw\\nMrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped\\naround a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They\\nappeared to be demanding to know where Harry was\\nand what had happened to him. All of them whipped\\naround as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog\\nentered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled\\nscream.\\n“Harry! Oh Harry!”\\nShe started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore\\nmoved between them.\\n“Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to\\nme for a moment. Harry has been through a terrible\\nordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me.\\nWhat he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If\\nhe would like you all to stay with him,” he added,\\nlooking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, “you\\nmay do so. But I do not want you questioning him\\nuntil he is ready to answer, and certainly not this\\nevening.”\\nMrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She\\nrounded on Ron, Hermione, and Bill as though they\\nwere being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear? He\\nneeds quiet!”\\n“Headmaster,” said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the\\ngreat black dog that was Sirius, “may I ask what — ?”\\n“This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,”\\nsaid Dumbledore simply. “I assure you, he is\\n \\nextremely well trained. Harry — I will wait while you\\nget into bed.”\\nHarry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to\\nDumbledore for asking the others not to question\\nhim. It wasn’t as though he didn’t want them there;\\nbut the thought of explaining it all over again, the\\nidea of reliving it one more time, was more than he\\ncould stand.\\n“I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with\\nFudge, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I would like you to\\nremain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the\\nschool.” He left.\\nAs Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he\\ncaught sight of the real Moody lying motionless in a\\nbed at the far end of the room. His wooden leg and\\nmagical eye were lying on the bedside table.\\n“Is he okay?” Harry asked.\\n“He’ll be fine,” said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry\\nsome pajamas and pulling screens around him. He\\ntook off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and got into\\nbed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black\\ndog came around the screen and settled themselves\\nin chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione\\nwere looking at him almost cautiously, as though\\nscared of him.\\n“I’m all right,” he told them. “Just tired.”\\nMrs. Weasley’s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed\\nhis bedcovers unnecessarily.\\nMadam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office,\\nreturned holding a small bottle of some purple potion\\nand a goblet.\\n \\n“You’ll need to drink all of this, Harry,” she said. “It’s\\na potion for dreamless sleep.”\\nHarry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He\\nfelt himself becoming drowsy at once. Everything\\naround him became hazy; the lamps around the\\nhospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a\\nfriendly way through the screen around his bed; his\\nbody felt as though it was sinking deeper into the\\nwarmth of the feather matress. Before he could finish\\nthe potion, before he could say another word, his\\nexhaustion had carried him off to sleep.\\nHarry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he\\ndidn’t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again. The\\nroom was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still\\nnighttime and had a feeling that he couldn’t have\\nbeen asleep very long.\\nThen he heard whispering around him.\\n“They’ll wake him if they don’t shut up!”\\n“What are they shouting about? Nothing else can\\nhave happened, can it?”\\nHarry opened his eyes blearily Someone had removed\\nhis glasses. He could see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs.\\nWeasley and Bill close by. Mrs. Weasley was on her\\nfeet.\\n“That’s Fudge’s voice,” she whispered. “And that’s\\nMinerva McGonagall’s, isn’t it? But what are they\\narguing about?”\\nNow Harry could hear them too: people shouting and\\nrunning toward the hospital wing.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Regrettable, but all the same, Minerva — ” Cornelius\\nFudge was saying loudly.\\n“You should never have brought it inside the castle!”\\nyelled Professor McGonagall. “When Dumbledore\\nfinds out — ”\\nHarry heard the hospital doors burst open. Unnoticed\\nby any of the people around his bed, all of whom were\\nstaring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens,\\nHarry sat up and put his glasses back on.\\nFudge came striding up the ward. Professors\\nMcGonagall and Snape were at his heels.\\n“Where’s Dumbledore?” Fudge demanded of Mrs.\\nWeasley.\\n“He’s not here,” said Mrs. Weasley angrily. “This is a\\nhospital wing, Minister, don’t you think you’d do\\nbetter to — ”\\nBut the door opened, and Dumbledore came sweeping\\nup the ward.\\n“What has happened?” said Dumbledore sharply,\\nlooking from Fudge to Professor McGonagall. “Why\\nare you disturbing these people? Minerva, I’m\\nsurprised at you — I asked you to stand guard over\\nBarty Crouch — ”\\n“There is no need to stand guard over him anymore,\\nDumbledore!” she shrieked. “The Minister has seen to\\nthat!”\\nHarry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose\\ncontrol like this. There were angry blotches of color in\\nher cheeks, and her hands were balled into fists; she\\nwas trembling with fury.\\n \\n“When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the\\nDeath Eater responsible for tonight’s events,” said\\nSnape, in a low voice, “he seemed to feel his personal\\nsafety was in question. He insisted on summoning a\\ndementor to accompany him into the castle. He\\nbrought it up to the office where Barty Crouch — ”\\n“I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!”\\nProfessor McGonagall fumed. “I told him you would\\nnever allow dementors to set foot inside the castle,\\nbut — ”\\n“My dear woman!” roared Fudge, who likewise looked\\nangrier than Harry had ever seen him, “as Minister of\\nMagic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring\\nprotection with me when interviewing a possibly\\ndangerous — ”\\nBut Professor McGonagall’s voice drowned Fudge’s.\\n“The moment that — that thing entered the room,”\\nshe screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over,\\n“it swooped down on Crouch and — and — ”\\nHarry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor\\nMcGonagall struggled to find words to describe what\\nhad happened. He did not need her to finish her\\nsentence. He knew what the dementor must have\\ndone. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty\\nCrouch. It had sucked his soul out through his\\nmouth. He was worse than dead.\\n“By all accounts, he is no loss!” blustered Fudge. “It\\nseems he has been responsible for several deaths!”\\n“But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said\\nDumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as\\nthough seeing him plainly for the first time. “He\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ncannot give evidence about why he killed those\\npeople.”\\n“Why he killed them? Well, that’s no mystery, is it?”\\nblustered Fudge. “He was a raving lunatic! From what\\nMinerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have\\nthought he was doing it all on You-Know- Who’s\\ninstructions!”\\n“Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions,\\nCornelius,” Dumbledore said. “Those people’s deaths\\nwere mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort\\nto full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort\\nhas been restored to his body.”\\nFudge looked as though someone had just swung a\\nheavy weight into his face. Dazed and blinking, he\\nstared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn’t quite\\nbelieve what he had just heard. He began to sputter,\\nstill goggling at Dumbledore.\\n“You-Know- Who ... returned? Preposterous. Come\\nnow, Dumbledore ...”\\n“As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,”\\nsaid Dumbledore, “we heard Barry Crouch confess.\\nUnder the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how\\nhe was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort\\n— learning of his continued existence from Bertha\\nJorkins — went to free him from his father and used\\nhim to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you.\\nCrouch has helped Voldemort to return.”\\n“See here, Dumbledore,” said Fudge, and Harry was\\nastonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face,\\n“you — you can’t seriously believe that. You-Know-\\nWho — back? Come now, come now . . . certainly,\\nCrouch may have believed himself to be acting upon\\n \\nYou-Know- Who’s orders — but to take the word of a\\nlunatic like that, Dumbledore ...”\\n“When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he\\nwas transported straight to Voldemort,” said\\nDumbledore steadily. “He witnessed Lord Voldemort’s\\nrebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to\\nmy office.”\\nDumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he\\nwas awake, but shook his head and said, “I am afraid\\nI cannot permit you to question Harry tonight.”\\nFudge’s curious smile lingered. He too glanced at\\nHarry, then looked back at Dumbledore, and said,\\n“You are — er — prepared to take Harry’s word on\\nthis, are you, Dumbledore?”\\nThere was a moment’s silence, which was broken by\\nSirius growling. His hackles were raised, and he was\\nbaring his teeth at Fudge.\\n“Certainly, I believe Harry,” said Dumbledore. His\\neyes were blazing now. “I heard Crouch’s confession,\\nand I heard Harry’s account of what happened after\\nhe touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make\\nsense, they explain everything that has happened\\nsince Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.”\\nFudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once\\nagain, he glanced at Harry before answering.\\n“You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has\\nreturned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a\\nboy who ... well ...”\\nFudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly\\nunderstood.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“You’ve been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,” he\\nsaid quietly.\\nRon, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped.\\nNone of them had realized that Harry was awake.\\nFudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate\\nlook came over his face.\\n“And if I have?” he said, looking at Dumbledore. “If I\\nhave discovered that you’ve been keeping certain facts\\nabout the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And\\nhaving funny turns all over the place — ”\\n“I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry\\nhas been experiencing in his scar?” said Dumbledore\\ncoolly.\\n“You admit that he has been having these pains,\\nthen?” said Fudge quickly. “Headaches? Nightmares?\\nPossibly — hallucinations?”\\n“Listen to me, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, taking a\\nstep toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to\\nradiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry\\nhad felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young\\nCrouch. “Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon\\nhis forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it\\nhurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling\\nparticularly murderous.”\\nFudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore,\\nbut he looked no less stubborn.\\n“You’ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I’ve never heard\\nof a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before. ...”\\n“Look, I saw Voldemort come back!” Harry shouted.\\nHe tried to get out of bed again, but Mrs. Weasley\\n \\nforced him back. “I saw the Death Eaters! I can give\\nyou their names! Lucius Malfoy — ”\\nSnape made a sudden movement, but as Harry\\nlooked at him, Snape’s eyes flew back to Fudge.\\n“Malfoy was cleared!” said Fudge, visibly affronted. “A\\nvery old family — donations to excellent causes — ”\\n“Macnair!” Harry continued.\\n“Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!”\\n“Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle — ”\\n“You are merely repeating the names of those who\\nwere acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years\\nago!” said Fudge angrily. “You could have found those\\nnames in old reports of the trials! For heaven’s sake,\\nDumbledore — the boy was full of some crackpot\\nstory at the end of last year too — his tales are getting\\ntaller, and you’re still swallowing them — the boy can\\ntalk to snakes, Dumbledore, and you still think he’s\\ntrustworthy?”\\n“You fool!” Professor McGonagall cried. “Cedric\\nDiggory! Mr. Crouch! These deaths were not the\\nrandom work of a lunatic!”\\n“I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge,\\nnow matching her anger, his face purpling. “It seems\\nto me that you are all determined to start a panic that\\nwill destabilize everything we have worked for these\\nlast thirteen years!”\\nHarry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He had\\nalways thought of Fudge as a kindly figure, a little\\nblustering, a little pompous, but essentially good-\\nnatured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before\\n \\nhim, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of\\ndisruption in his comfortable and ordered world — to\\nbelieve that Voldemort could have risen.\\n“Voldemort has returned,” Dumbledore repeated. “If\\nyou accept that fact straightaway, Fudge, and take\\nthe necessary measures, we may still be able to save\\nthe situation. The first and most essential step is to\\nremove Azkaban from the control of the dementors — ”\\n“Preposterous!” shouted Fudge again. “Remove the\\ndementors? I’d be kicked out of office for suggesting\\nit! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night\\nbecause we know the dementors are standing guard\\nat Azkaban!”\\n“The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds,\\nCornelius, knowing that you have put Lord\\nVoldemort ’s most dangerous supporters in the care of\\ncreatures who will join him the instant he asks them!”\\nsaid Dumbledore. “They will not remain loyal to you,\\nFudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope\\nfor their powers and their pleasures than you can!\\nWith the dementors behind him, and his old\\nsupporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed\\nto stop him regaining the sort of power he had\\nthirteen years ago!”\\nFudge was opening and closing his mouth as though\\nno words could express his outrage.\\n“The second step you must take — and at once,”\\nDumbledore pressed on, “is to send envoys to the\\ngiants.”\\n“Envoys to the giants?” Fudge shrieked, finding his\\ntongue again. “What madness is this?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is\\ntoo late,” said Dumbledore, “or Voldemort will\\npersuade them, as he did before, that he alone among\\nwizards will give them their rights and their freedom!”\\n“You — you cannot be serious!” Fudge gasped,\\nshaking his head and retreating further from\\nDumbledore. “If the magical community got wind that\\nI had approached the giants — people hate them,\\nDumbledore — end of my career — ”\\n“You are blinded,” said Dumbledore, his voice rising\\nnow, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes\\nblazing once more, “by the love of the office you hold,\\nCornelius! You place too much importance, and you\\nalways have done, on the so-called purity of blood!\\nYou fail to recognize that it matters not what someone\\nis born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor has\\njust destroyed the last remaining member of a pure-\\nblood family as old as any — and see what that man\\nchose to make of his life! I tell you now — take the\\nsteps I have suggested, and you will be remembered,\\nin office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest\\nMinisters of Magic we have ever known. Fail to act —\\nand history will remember you as the man who\\nstepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance\\nto destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!”\\n“Insane,” whispered Fudge, still backing away. “Mad\\nAnd then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was\\nstanding frozen at the foot of Harry’s bed, her hands\\nover her mouth. Mrs. Weasley was still standing over\\nHarry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from\\nrising. Bill, Ron, and Hermione were staring at Fudge.\\n“If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you\\nas far as this, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, “we have\\n \\nreached a parting of the ways. You must act as you\\nsee fit. And I — I shall act as I see fit.”\\nDumbledore ’s voice carried no hint of a threat; it\\nsounded like a mere statement, but Fudge bristled as\\nthough Dumbledore were advancing upon him with a\\nwand.\\n“Now, see here, Dumbledore,” he said, waving a\\nthreatening finger. “I’ve given you free rein, always.\\nI’ve had a lot of respect for you. I might not have\\nagreed with some of your decisions, but I’ve kept\\nquiet. There aren’t many who’d have let you hire\\nwerewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach\\nyour students without reference to the Ministry. But if\\nyou’re going to work against me — ”\\n“The only one against whom I intend to work,” said\\nDumbledore, “is Lord Voldemort. If you are against\\nhim, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same side.”\\nIt seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He\\nrocked backward and forward on his small feet for a\\nmoment and spun his bowler hat in his hands.\\nFinally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, “He\\ncan’t be back, Dumbledore, he just can’t be ...”\\nSnape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up\\nthe left sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out\\nhis forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.\\n“There,” said Snape harshly. “There. The Dark Mark.\\nIt is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it\\nburned black, but you can still see it. Every Death\\nEater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord.\\nIt was a means of distinguishing one another, and his\\nmeans of summoning us to him. When he touched\\nthe Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate,\\nand Apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has\\n \\nbeen growing clearer all year. Karkaroff’s too. Why do\\nyou think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the\\nMark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff\\nfears the Dark Lord’s vengeance. He betrayed too\\nmany of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a\\nwelcome back into the fold.”\\nFudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking\\nhis head. He did not seem to have taken in a word\\nSnape had said. He stared, apparently repelled by the\\nugly mark on Snape ’s arm, then looked up at\\nDumbledore and whispered, “I don’t know what you\\nand your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have\\nheard enough. I have no more to add. I will be in\\ntouch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the\\nrunning of this school. I must return to the Ministry.”\\nHe had almost reached the door when he paused. He\\nturned around, strode back down the dormitory, and\\nstopped at Harry’s bed.\\n“Your winnings,” he said shortly, taking a large bag of\\ngold out of his pocket and dropping it onto Harry’s\\nbedside table. “One thousand Galleons. There should\\nhave been a presentation ceremony, but under the\\ncircumstances ...”\\nHe crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked\\nout of the room, slamming the door behind him. The\\nmoment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to\\nlook at the group around Harry’s bed.\\n“There is work to be done,” he said. “Molly ... am I\\nright in thinking that I can count on you and\\nArthur?”\\n“Of course you can,” said Mrs. Weasley. She was\\nwhite to the lips, but she looked resolute. “We know\\nwhat Fudge is. It’s Arthur’s fondness for Muggles that\\n \\nhas held him back at the Ministry all these years.\\nFudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride.”\\n“Then I need to send a message to Arthur,” said\\nDumbledore. “All those that we can persuade of the\\ntruth must be notified immediately, and he is well\\nplaced to contact those at the Ministry who are not as\\nshortsighted as Cornelius.”\\n“Ill go to Dad,” said Bill, standing up. “Ill go now.”\\n“Excellent,” said Dumbledore. “Tell him what has\\nhappened. Tell him I will be in direct contact with him\\nshortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge\\nthinks I am interfering at the Ministry — ”\\n“Leave it to me,” said Bill.\\nHe clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, kissed his\\nmother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode\\nquickly from the room.\\n“Minerva,” said Dumbledore, turning to Professor\\nMcGonagall, “I want to see Hagrid in my office as\\nsoon as possible. Also — if she will consent to come —\\nMadame Maxime.”\\nProfessor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.\\n“Poppy,” Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, “would\\nyou be very kind and go down to Professor Moody’s\\noffice, where I think you will find a house-elf called\\nWinky in considerable distress? Do what you can for\\nher, and take her back to the kitchens. I think Dobby\\nwill look after her for us.”\\n“Very — very well,” said Madam Pomfrey, looking\\nstartled, and she too left.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nDumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and\\nthat Madam Pomfrey’s footsteps had died away,\\nbefore he spoke again.\\n“And now,” he said, “it is time for two of our number\\nto recognize each other for what they are. Sirius ... if\\nyou could resume your usual form.”\\nThe great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then,\\nin an instant, turned back into a man.\\nMrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.\\n“Sirius Black!” she shrieked, pointing at him.\\n“Mum, shut up!” Ron yelled. “It’s okay!”\\nSnape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the\\nlook on his face was one of mingled fury and horror.\\n“Him!” he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face\\nshowed equal dislike. “What is he doing here?”\\n“He is here at my invitation,” said Dumbledore,\\nlooking between them, “as are you, Severus. I trust\\nyou both. It is time for you to lay aside your old\\ndifferences and trust each other.”\\nHarry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near\\nmiracle. Sirius and Snape were eyeing each other\\nwith the utmost loathing.\\n“I will settle, in the short term,” said Dumbledore,\\nwith a bite of impatience in his voice, “for a lack of\\nopen hostility. You will shake hands. You are on the\\nsame side now. Time is short, and unless the few of\\nus who know the truth do not stand united, there is\\nno hope for any of us.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nVery slowly — but still glaring at each other as\\nthough each wished the other nothing but ill — Sirius\\nand Snape moved toward each other and shook\\nhands. They let go extremely quickly.\\n“That will do to be going on with,” said Dumbledore,\\nstepping between them once more. “Now I have work\\nfor each of you. Fudge’s attitude, though not\\nunexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to\\nset off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella\\nFigg, Mundungus Fletcher — the old crowd. Lie low at\\nLupins for a while; I will contact you there.”\\n“But — ” said Harry.\\nHe wanted Sirius to stay. He did not want to have to\\nsay goodbye again so quickly.\\n“You’ll see me very soon, Harry,” said Sirius, turning\\nto him. “I promise you. But I must do what I can, you\\nunderstand, don’t you?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah ... of course I do.”\\nSirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to\\nDumbledore, transformed again into the black dog,\\nand ran the length of the room to the door, whose\\nhandle he turned with a paw. Then he was gone.\\n“Severus,” said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, “you\\nknow what I must ask you to do. If you are ready ... if\\nyou are prepared ...”\\n“I am,” said Snape.\\nHe looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold,\\nblack eyes glittered strangely.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Then good luck,” said Dumbledore, and he watched,\\nwith a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape\\nswept wordlessly after Sirius.\\nIt was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke\\nagain.\\n“I must go downstairs,” he said finally. “I must see the\\nDiggorys. Harry — take the rest of your potion. I will\\nsee all of you later.”\\nHarry slumped back against his pillows as\\nDumbledore disappeared. Hermione, Ron, and Mrs.\\nWeasley were all looking at him. None of them spoke\\nfor a very long time.\\n“You’ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry,”\\nMrs. Weasley said at last. Her hand nudged the sack\\nof gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the\\nbottle and the goblet. “You have a good long sleep. Try\\nand think about something else for a while . . . think\\nabout what you’re going to buy with your winnings!”\\n“I don’t want that gold,” said Harry in an\\nexpressionless voice. “You have it. Anyone can have\\nit. I shouldn’t have won it. It should’ve been Cedric’s.”\\nThe thing against which he had been fighting on and\\noff ever since he had come out of the maze was\\nthreatening to overpower him. He could feel a\\nburning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his\\neyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.\\n“It wasn’t your fault, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley whispered.\\n“I told him to take the cup with me,” said Harry.\\nNow the burning feeling was in his throat too. He\\nwished Ron would look away.\\n \\nMrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside\\ncabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry.\\nHe had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as\\nthough by a mother. The full weight of everything he\\nhad seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as\\nMrs. Weasley held him to her. His mother’s face, his\\nfather’s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground\\nall started spinning in his head until he could hardly\\nbear it, until he was screwing up his face against the\\nhowl of misery fighting to get out of him.\\nThere was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley\\nand Harry broke apart. Hermione was standing by the\\nwindow. She was holding something tight in her\\nhand.\\n“Sorry,” she whispered.\\n“Your potion, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley quickly,\\nwiping her eyes on the back of her hand.\\nHarry drank it in one gulp. The effect was\\ninstantaneous. Heavy, irresistible waves of dreamless\\nsleep broke over him; he fell back onto his pillows and\\nthought no more.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nTHE BEGINNING\\nWhen he looked back, even a month later, Harry\\nfound he had only scattered memories of the next few\\ndays. It was as though he had been through too much\\nto take in any more. The recollections he did have\\nwere very painful. The worst, perhaps, was the\\nmeeting with the Diggorys that took place the\\nfollowing morning.\\nThey did not blame him for what had happened; on\\nthe contrary, both thanked him for returning Cedric’s\\nbody to them. Mr. Diggory sobbed through most of\\nthe interview. Mrs. Diggory ’s grief seemed to be\\nbeyond tears.\\n“He suffered very little then,” she said, when Harry\\nhad told her how Cedric had died. “And after all,\\nAmos ... he died just when he’d won the tournament.\\nHe must have been happy.”\\nWhen they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry\\nand said, “You look after yourself, now.”\\n \\nHarry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.\\n“You take this,” he muttered to her. “It should’ve been\\nCedric’s, he got there first, you take it — ”\\nBut she backed away from him.\\n“Oh no, it’s yours, dear, I couldn’t ... you keep it.”\\nHarry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following\\nevening. From what Hermione and Ron told him,\\nDumbledore had spoken to the school that morning\\nat breakfast. He had merely requested that they leave\\nHarry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger\\nhim to tell the story of what had happened in the\\nmaze. Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in\\nthe corridors, avoiding his eyes. Some whispered\\nbehind their hands as he passed. He guessed that\\nmany of them had believed Rita Skeeter’s article\\nabout how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was.\\nPerhaps they were formulating their own theories\\nabout how Cedric had died. He found he didn’t care\\nvery much. He liked it best when he was with Ron\\nand Hermione and they were talking about other\\nthings, or else letting him sit in silence while they\\nplayed chess. He felt as though all three of them had\\nreached an understanding they didn’t need to put\\ninto words; that each was waiting for some sign, some\\nword, of what was going on outside Hogwarts — and\\nthat it was useless to speculate about what might be\\ncoming until they knew anything for certain. The only\\ntime they touched upon the subject was when Ron\\ntold Harry about a meeting Mrs. Weasley had had\\nwith Dumbledore before going home.\\n“She went to ask him if you could come straight to us\\nthis summer,” he said. “But he wants you to go back\\nto the Dursleys, at least at first.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Why?” said Harry.\\n“She said Dumbledore’s got his reasons,” said Ron,\\nshaking his head darkly. “I suppose we’ve got to trust\\nhim, haven’t we?”\\nThe only person apart from Ron and Hermione that\\nHarry felt able to talk to was Hagrid. As there was no\\nlonger a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, they\\nhad those lessons free. They used the one on\\nThursday afternoon to go down and visit Hagrid in his\\ncabin. It was a bright and sunny day; Fang bounded\\nout of the open door as they approached, barking and\\nwagging his tail madly.\\n“Who’s that?” called Hagrid, coming to the door.\\n“ Harry\\\\”\\nHe strode out to meet them, pulled Harry into a one-\\narmed hug, ruffled his hair, and said, “Good ter see\\nyeh, mate. Good ter see yeh.”\\nThey saw two bucket-size cups and saucers on the\\nwooden table in front of the fireplace when they\\nentered Hagrid ’s cabin.\\n“Bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe,” Hagrid said. “She’s\\njus’ left.”\\n“Who?” said Ron curiously.\\n“Madame Maxime, o’ course!” said Hagrid.\\n“You two made up, have you?” said Ron.\\n“Dunno what yeh’re talkin’ about,” said Hagrid airily,\\nfetching more cups from the dresser. When he had\\nmade tea and offered around a plate of doughy\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ncookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed\\nHarry closely through his beetle-black eyes.\\n“You all righ’?” he said gruffly.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry.\\n“No, yeh’re not,” said Hagrid. “ ’Course yeh’re not. But\\nyeh will be.”\\nHarry said nothing.\\n“Knew he was goin’ ter come back,” said Hagrid, and\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked up at him, shocked.\\n“Known it fer years, Harry. Knew he was out there,\\nbidin’ his time. It had ter happen. Well, now it has,\\nan’ we’ll jus’ have ter get on with it. We’ll fight. Migh’\\nbe able ter stop him before he gets a good hold. That’s\\nDumbledore’s plan, anyway. Great man, Dumbledore.\\n’S long as we’ve got him, I’m not too worried.”\\nHagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving\\nexpressions on their faces.\\n“No good sittin’ worryin’ abou’ it,” he said. “What’s\\ncornin’ will come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does.\\nDumbledore told me wha’ you did, Harry.”\\nHagrid’s chest swelled as he looked at Harry.\\n“Yeh did as much as yer father would’ve done, an’ I\\ncan’ give yeh no higher praise than that.”\\nHarry smiled back at him. It was the first time he’d\\nsmiled in days. “What’s Dumbledore asked you to do,\\nHagrid?” he asked. “He sent Professor McGonagall to\\nask you and Madame Maxime to meet him — that\\nnight.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Got a little job fer me over the summer,” said Hagrid.\\n“Secret, though. I’m not s’pposed ter talk abou’ it, no,\\nnot even ter you lot. Olympe — Madame Maxime ter\\nyou — might be cornin’ with me. I think she will.\\nThink I got her persuaded.”\\n“Is it to do with Voldemort?”\\nHagrid flinched at the sound of the name.\\n“Migh’ be,” he said evasively. “Now ... who’d like ter\\ncome an’ visit the las’ skrewt with me? I was jokin’ —\\njokin’!” he added hastily, seeing the looks on their\\nfaces.\\nk k k\\nIt was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk\\nup in the dormitory on the night before his return to\\nPrivet Drive. He was dreading the Leaving Feast,\\nwhich was usually a cause for celebration, when the\\nwinner of the Inter-House Championship would be\\nannounced. He had avoided being in the Great Hall\\nwhen it was full ever since he had left the hospital\\nwing, preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to\\navoid the stares of his fellow students.\\nWhen he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they\\nsaw at once that the usual decorations were missing.\\nThe Great Hall was normally decorated with the\\nwinning House’s colors for the Leaving Feast. Tonight,\\nhowever, there were black drapes on the wall behind\\nthe teachers’ table. Harry knew instantly that they\\nwere there as a mark of respect to Cedric.\\nThe real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now,\\nhis wooden leg and his magical eye back in place. He\\nwas extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nspoke to him. Harry couldn’t blame him; Moody’s fear\\nof attack was bound to have been increased by his\\nten-month imprisonment in his own trunk. Professor\\nKarkaroff’s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he\\nsat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff\\nwas now, and whether Voldemort had caught up with\\nhim.\\nMadame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next\\nto Hagrid. They were talking quietly together. Further\\nalong the table, sitting next to Professor McGonagall,\\nwas Snape. His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment\\nas Harry looked at him. His expression was difficult to\\nread. He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever.\\nHarry continued to watch him, long after Snape had\\nlooked away.\\nWhat was it that Snape had done on Dumbledore’s\\norders, the night that Voldemort had returned? And\\nwhy ... why ... was Dumbledore so convinced that\\nSnape was truly on their side? He had been their spy,\\nDumbledore had said so in the Pensieve. Snape had\\nturned spy against Voldemort, “at great personal\\nrisk.” Was that the job he had taken up again? Had\\nhe made contact with the Death Eaters, perhaps?\\nPretended that he had never really gone over to\\nDumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort\\nhimself, biding his time?\\nHarry’s musings were ended by Professor\\nDumbledore, who stood up at the staff table. The\\nGreat Hall, which in any case had been less noisy\\nthan it usually was at the Leaving Feast, became very\\nquiet.\\n“The end,” said Dumbledore, looking around at them\\nall, “of another year.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHe paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff\\ntable. Theirs had been the most subdued table before\\nhe had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the\\nsaddest and palest faces in the Hall.\\n“There is much that I would like to say to you all\\ntonight,” said Dumbledore, “but I must first\\nacknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who\\nshould be sitting here,” he gestured toward the\\nHufflepuffs, “enjoying our feast with us. I would like\\nyou all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to\\nCedric Diggory.”\\nThey did it, all of them; the benches scraped as\\neveryone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets,\\nand echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, “Cedric\\nDiggory.”\\nHarry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd.\\nThere were tears pouring silently down her face. He\\nlooked down at the table as they all sat down again.\\n“Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the\\nqualities that distinguish Hufflepuff house,”\\nDumbledore continued. “He was a good and loyal\\nfriend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. His death\\nhas affected you all, whether you knew him well or\\nnot. I think that you have the right, therefore, to\\nknow exactly how it came about.”\\nHarry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.\\n“Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.”\\nA panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were\\nstaring at Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror. He\\nlooked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter\\nthemselves into silence.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“The Ministry of Magic,” Dumbledore continued, “does\\nnot wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of\\nyour parents will be horrified that I have done so —\\neither because they will not believe that Lord\\nVoldemort has returned, or because they think I\\nshould not tell you so, young as you are. It is my\\nbelief, however, that the truth is generally preferable\\nto lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric\\ndied as the result of an accident, or some sort of\\nblunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.”\\nStunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was\\nturned toward Dumbledore now ... or almost every\\nface. Over at the Slytherin table, Harry saw Draco\\nMalfoy muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle.\\nHarry felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in his stomach.\\nHe forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.\\n“There is somebody else who must be mentioned in\\nconnection with Cedric’s death,” Dumbledore went\\non. “I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.”\\nA kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads\\nturned in Harry’s direction before flicking back to face\\nDumbledore.\\n“Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,”\\nsaid Dumbledore. “He risked his own life to return\\nCedric’s body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every\\nrespect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever\\nshown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honor\\nhim.”\\nDumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his\\ngoblet once more. Nearly everyone in the Great Hall\\nfollowed suit. They murmured his name, as they had\\nmurmured Cedric’s, and drank to him. But through a\\ngap in the standing figures, Harry saw that Malfoy,\\nCrabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had\\n \\nremained defiantly in their seats, their goblets\\nuntouched. Dumbledore, who after all possessed no\\nmagical eye, did not see them.\\nWhen everyone had once again resumed their seats,\\nDumbledore continued, “The Triwizard Tournament’s\\naim was to further and promote magical\\nunderstanding. In the light of what has happened —\\nof Lord Voldemort’s return — such ties are more\\nimportant than ever before.”\\nDumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and\\nHagrid, to Fleur Delacour and her fellow Beauxbatons\\nstudents, to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at the\\nSlytherin table. Krum, Harry saw, looked wary,\\nalmost frightened, as though he expected Dumbledore\\nto say something harsh.\\n“Every guest in this Hall,” said Dumbledore, and his\\neyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, “will be\\nwelcomed back here at any time, should they wish to\\ncome. I say to you all, once again — in the light of\\nLord Voldemort’s return, we are only as strong as we\\nare united, as weak as we are divided. Lord\\nVoldemort’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is\\nvery great. We can fight it only by showing an equally\\nstrong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of\\nhabit and language are nothing at all if our aims are\\nidentical and our hearts are open.\\n“It is my belief — and never have I so hoped that I am\\nmistaken — that we are all facing dark and difficult\\ntimes. Some of you in this Hall have already suffered\\ndirectly at the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your\\nfamilies have been torn asunder. A week ago, a\\nstudent was taken from our midst.\\n“Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should\\ncome when you have to make a choice between what\\n \\nis right and what is easy, remember what happened\\nto a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because\\nhe strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort.\\nRemember Cedric Diggory.”\\nHarry’s trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her\\ncage on top of it. He, Ron, and Hermione were waiting\\nin the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the\\nfourth years for the carriages that would take them\\nback to Hogsmeade station. It was another beautiful\\nsummer’s day. He supposed that Privet Drive would\\nbe hot and leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when\\nhe arrived there that evening. The thought gave him\\nno pleasure at all.\\n“ ’Arry!”\\nHe looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up\\nthe stone steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across\\nthe grounds, Harry could see Hagrid helping Madame\\nMaxime to back two of the giant horses into their\\nharness. The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take\\noff.\\n“We will see each uzzer again, I ’ope,” said Fleur as\\nshe reached him, holding out her hand. “I am ’oping\\nto get a job ’ere, to improve my Eenglish.”\\n“It’s very good already,” said Ron in a strangled sort of\\nvoice. Fleur smiled at him; Hermione scowled.\\n“Good-bye, ’Arry,” said Fleur, turning to go. “It ’az\\nbeen a pleasure meeting you!”\\nHarry’s spirits couldn’t help but lift slightly as he\\nwatched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to\\nMadame Maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the\\nsunlight.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting\\nback,” said Ron. “D’you reckon they can steer that\\nship without Karkaroff?”\\n“Karkaroff did not steer,” said a gruff voice. “He\\nstayed in his cabin and let us do the vork.”\\nKrum had come to say good-bye to Hermione.\\n“Could I have a vord?” he asked her.\\n“Oh ... yes ... all right,” said Hermione, looking\\nslightly flustered, and following Krum through the\\ncrowd and out of sight.\\n“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her.\\n“The carriages’ll be here in a minute!”\\nHe let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however,\\nand spent the next few minutes craning his neck over\\nthe crowd to try and see what Krum and Hermione\\nmight be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared\\nat Hermione, but her face was quite impassive.\\n“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He\\nvos alvays polite to me. Alvays. Even though I vos\\nfrom Durmstrang — with Karkaroff,” he added,\\nscowling.\\n“Have you got a new headmaster yet?” said Harry.\\nKrum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had\\ndone, shook Harry’s hand, and then Ron’s. Ron\\nlooked as though he was suffering some sort of\\npainful internal struggle. Krum had already started\\nwalking away when Ron burst out, “Can I have your\\nautograph?”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHermione turned away, smiling at the horseless\\ncarriages that were now trundling toward them up the\\ndrive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified, signed\\na fragment of parchment for Ron.\\nThe weather could not have been more different on\\nthe journey back to King’s Cross than it had been on\\ntheir way to Hogwarts the previous September. There\\nwasn’t a single cloud in the sky. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione had managed to get a compartment to\\nthemselves. Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under\\nRon’s dress robes to stop him from hooting\\ncontinually; Hedwig was dozing, her head under her\\nwing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat\\nlike a large, furry ginger cushion. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione talked more fully and freely than they had\\nall week as the train sped them southward. Harry felt\\nas though Dumbledore’s speech at the Leaving Feast\\nhad unblocked him, somehow. It was less painful to\\ndiscuss what had happened now. They broke off their\\nconversation about what action Dumbledore might be\\ntaking, even now, to stop Voldemort only when the\\nlunch trolley arrived.\\nWhen Hermione returned from the trolley and put her\\nmoney back into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy\\nof the Daily Prophet that she had been carrying in\\nthere. Harry looked at it, unsure whether he really\\nwanted to know what it might say, but Hermione,\\nseeing him looking at it, said calmly, “There’s nothing\\nin there. You can look for yourself, but there’s\\nnothing at all. I’ve been checking every day. Just a\\nsmall piece the day after the third task saying you\\nwon the tournament. They didn’t even mention\\nCedric. Nothing about any of it. If you ask me, Fudge\\nis forcing them to keep quiet.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“He’ll never keep Rita quiet,” said Harry. “Not on a\\nstory like this.”\\n“Oh, Rita hasn’t written anything at all since the third\\ntask,” said Hermione in an oddly constrained voice.\\n“As a matter of fact,” she added, her voice now\\ntrembling slightly, “Rita Skeeter isn’t going to be\\nwriting anything at all for a while. Not unless she\\nwants me to spill the beans on her.”\\n“What are you talking about?” said Ron.\\n“I found out how she was listening in on private\\nconversations when she wasn’t supposed to be\\ncoming onto the grounds,” said Hermione in a rush.\\nHarry had the impression that Hermione had been\\ndying to tell them this for days, but that she had\\nrestrained herself in light of everything else that had\\nhappened.\\n“How was she doing it?” said Harry at once.\\n“How did you find out?” said Ron, staring at her.\\n“Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea,\\nHarry,” she said.\\n“Did I?” said Harry, perplexed. “How?”\\n“Bugging,” said Hermione happily.\\n“But you said they didn’t work — ”\\n“Oh not electronic bugs,” said Hermione. “No, you see\\n... Rita Skeeter” — Hermione ’s voice trembled with\\nquiet triumph — “is an unregistered Animagus. She\\ncan turn — ”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nHermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out of her\\nbag.\\n“ — into a beetle.”\\n“You’re kidding,” said Ron. “You haven’t ... she’s not\\n“Oh yes she is,” said Hermione happily, brandishing\\nthe jar at them.\\nInside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat\\nbeetle.\\n“That’s never — you’re kidding — ” Ron whispered,\\nlifting the jar to his eyes.\\n“No, I’m not,” said Hermione, beaming. “I caught her\\non the windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very\\nclosely, and you 11 notice the markings around her\\nantennae are exactly like those foul glasses she\\nwears.”\\nHarry looked and saw that she was quite right. He\\nalso remembered something.\\n“There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard\\nHagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum!”\\n“Exactly,” said Hermione. “And Viktor pulled a beetle\\nout of my hair after we’d had our conversation by the\\nlake. And unless I’m very much mistaken, Rita was\\nperched on the windowsill of the Divination class the\\nday your scar hurt. She’s been buzzing around for\\nstories all year.”\\n“When we saw Malfoy under that tree ...” said Ron\\nslowly.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“He was talking to her, in his hand,” said Hermione.\\n“He knew, of course. That’s how she’s been getting all\\nthose nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They\\nwouldn’t care that she was doing something illegal, as\\nlong as they were giving her horrible stuff about us\\nand Hagrid.”\\nHermione took the glass jar back from Ron and\\nsmiled at the beetle, which buzzed angrily against the\\nglass.\\n“I’ve told her I’ll let her out when we get back to\\nLondon,” said Hermione. “I’ve put an Unbreakable\\nCharm on the jar, you see, so she can’t transform.\\nAnd I’ve told her she’s to keep her quill to herself for a\\nwhole year. See if she can’t break the habit of writing\\nhorrible lies about people.”\\nSmiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back\\ninside her schoolbag.\\nThe door of the compartment slid open.\\n“Very clever, Granger,” said Draco Malfoy.\\nCrabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All\\nthree of them looked more pleased with themselves,\\nmore arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had\\never seen them.\\n“So,” said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the\\ncompartment and looking slowly around at them, a\\nsmirk quivering on his lips. “You caught some\\npathetic reporter, and Potter’s Dumbledore’s favorite\\nboy again. Big deal.”\\nHis smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Trying not to think about it, are we?” said Malfoy\\nsoftly, looking around at all three of them. “Trying to\\npretend it hasn’t happened?”\\n“Get out,” said Harry.\\nHe had not been this close to Malfoy since he had\\nwatched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during\\nDumbledore’s speech about Cedric. He could feel a\\nkind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand\\nunder his robes.\\n“You’ve picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I\\ntold you you ought to choose your company more\\ncarefully, remember? When we met on the train, first\\nday at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with\\nriffraff like this!” He jerked his head at Ron and\\nHermione. “Too late now, Potter! They’ll be the first to\\ngo, now the Dark Lord’s back! Mudbloods and\\nMuggle-lovers first! Well — second — Diggory was the\\nf— ”\\nIt was as though someone had exploded a box of\\nfireworks within the compartment. Blinded by the\\nblaze of the spells that had blasted from every\\ndirection, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry\\nblinked and looked down at the floor.\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious\\nin the doorway. He, Ron, and Hermione were on their\\nfeet, all three of them having used a different hex. Nor\\nwere they the only ones to have done so.\\n“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said\\nFred matter-of-factly, stepping onto Goyle and into\\nthe compartment. He had his wand out, and so did\\nGeorge, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he\\nfollowed Fred inside.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K.

Looks\\nas though those two shouldn’t be mixed. He seems to\\nhave sprouted little tentacles all over his face. Well,\\nlet’s not leave them here, they don’t add much to the\\ndecor.”\\nRon, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed\\nthe unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle — each of\\nwhom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of\\njinxes with which they had been hit — out into the\\ncorridor, then came back into the compartment and\\nrolled the door shut.\\n“Exploding Snap, anyone?” said Fred, pulling out a\\npack of cards.\\nThey were halfway through their fifth game when\\nHarry decided to ask them.\\n“You going to tell us, then?” he said to George. “Who\\nyou were blackmailing?”\\n“Oh,” said George darkly. “ That\\n“It doesn’t matter,” said Fred, shaking his head\\nimpatiently. “It wasn’t anything important. Not now,\\nanyway.”\\n“We’ve given up,” said George, shrugging.\\nBut Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and\\nfinally, Fred said, “All right, all right, if you really\\nwant to know ... it was Ludo Bagman.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“Bagman?” said Harry sharply. “Are you saying he\\nwas involved in — ”\\n“Nah,” said George gloomily. “Nothing like that.\\nStupid git. He wouldn’t have the brains.”\\n“Well, what, then?” said Ron.\\nFred hesitated, then said, “You remember that bet we\\nhad with him at the Quidditch World Cup? About how\\nIreland would win, but Krum would get the Snitch?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry and Ron slowly.\\n“Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he’d caught\\nfrom the Irish mascots.”\\n“So?”\\n“So,” said Fred impatiently, “it vanished, didn’t it? By\\nnext morning, it had gone!”\\n“But — it must’ve been an accident, mustn’t it?” said\\nHermione.\\nGeorge laughed very bitterly.\\n“Yeah, that’s what we thought, at first. We thought if\\nwe just wrote to him, and told him he’d made a\\nmistake, he’d cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored\\nour letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at\\nHogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to\\nget away from us.”\\n“In the end, he turned pretty nasty,” said Fred. “Told\\nus we were too young to gamble, and he wasn’t giving\\nus anything.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\n“So we asked for our money back,” said George\\nglowering.\\n“He didn’t refuse!” gasped Hermione.\\n“Right in one,” said Fred.\\n“But that was all your savings!” said Ron.\\n“Tell me about it,” said George. “ ’Course, we found\\nout what was going on in the end. Lee Jordan’s dad\\nhad had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as\\nwell. Turns out he’s in big trouble with the goblins.\\nBorrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them\\ncornered him in the woods after the World Cup and\\ntook all the gold he had, and it still wasn’t enough to\\ncover all his debts. They followed him all the way to\\nHogwarts to keep an eye on him. He’s lost everything\\ngambling. Hasn’t got two Galleons to rub together.\\nAnd you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins\\nback?”\\n“How?” said Harry.\\n“He put a bet on you, mate,” said Fred. “Put a big bet\\non you to win the tournament. Bet against the\\ngoblins.”\\n“So that’s why he kept trying to help me win!” said\\nHarry. “Well — I did win, didn’t I? So he can pay you\\nyour gold!”\\n“Nope,” said George, shaking his head. “The goblins\\nplay as dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory,\\nand Bagman was betting you’d win outright. So\\nBagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after\\nthe third task.”\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\nGeorge sighed deeply and started dealing out the\\ncards again.\\nThe rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough;\\nHarry wished it could have gone on all summer, in\\nfact, and that he would never arrive at King’s Cross . . .\\nbut as he had learned the hard way that year, time\\nwill not slow down when something unpleasant lies\\nahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was\\npulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The\\nusual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the\\nstudents began to disembark. Ron and Hermione\\nstruggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,\\ncarrying their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.\\n“Fred — George — wait a moment.”\\nThe twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and\\ndrew out his Triwizard winnings.\\n“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into\\nGeorge’s hands.\\n“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted.\\n“Take it,” Harry repeated firmly. “I don’t want it.”\\n“You’re mental,” said George, trying to push it back at\\nHarry.\\n“No, I’m not,” said Harry. “You take it, and get\\ninventing. It’s for the joke shop.”\\n“He is mental,” Fred said in an almost awed voice.\\n“Listen,” said Harry firmly. “If you don’t take it, I’m\\nthrowing it down the drain. I don’t want it and I don’t\\nneed it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling\\ndo with a few laughs. I’ve got a feeling we’re going to\\nneed them more than usual before long.”\\n“Harry,” said George weakly, weighing the money bag\\nin his hands, “there’s got to be a thousand Galleons\\nin here.”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, grinning. “Think how many\\nCanary Creams that is.”\\nThe twins stared at him.\\n“Just don’t tell your mum where you got it ...\\nalthough she might not be so keen for you to join the\\nMinistry anymore, come to think of it. ...”\\n“Harry,” Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand.\\n“Look,” he said flatly, “take it, or I’ll hex you. I know\\nsome good ones now. Just do me one favor, okay?\\nBuy Ron some different dress robes and say they’re\\nfrom you.”\\nHe left the compartment before they could say\\nanother word, stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe, and\\nGoyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex\\nmarks.\\nUncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs.\\nWeasley was close by him. She hugged Harry very\\ntightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear, “I\\nthink Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the\\nsummer. Keep in touch, Harry.”\\n“See you, Harry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back.\\n“ ’Bye, Harry!” said Hermione, and she did something\\nshe had never done before, and kissed him on the\\ncheek.\\n \\n“Harry — thanks,” George muttered, while Fred\\nnodded fervently at his side.\\nHarry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and\\nfollowed him silently from the station. There was no\\npoint worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the\\nback of the Dursleys’ car.\\nAs Hagrid had said, what would come, would come...\\nand he would have to meet it when it did.\\n \\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K.
