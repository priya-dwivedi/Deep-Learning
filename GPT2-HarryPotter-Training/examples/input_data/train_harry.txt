THE BOY WHO LIVED

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive,

were proud to say that they were perfectly normal,

thank you very much. They were the last people you’d

expect to be involved in anything strange or

mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such

nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called

Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy

man with hardly any neck, although he did have a

very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and

blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of

neck, which came in very useful as she spent so

much of her time craning over garden fences, spying

on the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son

called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer

boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they

also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that

somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they

could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.

Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t

 

met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended

she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her

good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it

was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think

what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in

the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a

small son, too, but they had never even seen him.

This boy was another good reason for keeping the

Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a

child like that.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray

Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the

cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and

mysterious things would soon be happening all over

the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out

his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley

gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming

Dudley into his high chair.

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past

the window.

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his

briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and

tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because

Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his

cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley

as he left the house. He got into his car and backed

out of number four’s drive.

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the

first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a

map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he

had seen — then he jerked his head around to look

again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner

of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What

could he have been thinking of? It must have been a

trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at

 

the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around

the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his

mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet

Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read

maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake

and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward

town he thought of nothing except a large order of

drills he was hoping to get that day.

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his

mind by something else. As he sat in the usual

morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that

there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people

about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear

people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups

you saw on young people! He supposed this was some

stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the

steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these

weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering

excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see

that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that

man had to be older than he was, and wearing an

emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it

struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly

stunt — these people were obviously collecting for

something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved

on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the

Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.

Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in

his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might

have found it harder to concentrate on drills that

morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in

broad daylight, though people down in the street did;

they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after

owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an

owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a

perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five

different people. He made several important telephone

 

calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good

mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch

his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a

bun from the bakery.

He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he

passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed

them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but

they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering

excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting

tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a

large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words

of what they were saying.

“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ”

“ — yes, their son, Harry — ”

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He

looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say

something to them, but thought better of it.

He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his

office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him,

seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing

his home number when he changed his mind. He put

the receiver back down and stroked his mustache,

thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t

such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots

of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.

Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew

was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It

might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no

point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so

upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame

her — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the

same, those people in cloaks ...

 

He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that

afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock,

he was still so worried that he walked straight into

someone just outside the door.

“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled

and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr.

Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet

cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost

knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split

into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that

made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir,

for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-

Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like

yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy

day!”

And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the

middle and walked off.

Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been

hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he

had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was

rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home,

hoping he was imagining things, which he had never

hoped before, because he didn’t approve of

imagination.

As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the

first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood —

was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was

now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the

same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.

“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.

The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look.

Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered.

Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the

 

house. He was still determined not to mention

anything to his wife.

Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told

him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems

with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new

word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.

When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the

living room in time to catch the last report on the

evening news:

“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported

that the nation’s owls have been behaving very

unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at

night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have

been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in

every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to

explain why the owls have suddenly changed their

sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a

grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim

McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more

showers of owls tonight, Jim?”

“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about

that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting

oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire,

and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that

instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a

downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have

been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until

next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night

tonight.”

Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars

all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious

people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a

whisper about the Potters . . .

 

Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two

cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say

something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er

— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister

lately, have you?”

As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and

angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t

have a sister.

“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”

“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled.

“Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of

funny-looking people in town today ...”

“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.

“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to

do with ... you know ... her crowd.”

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr.

Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d

heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare.

Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son —

he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”

“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.

“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”

“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”

“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking

horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”

He didn’t say another word on the subject as they

went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the

bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window

 

and peered down into the front garden. The cat was

still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though

it were waiting for something.

Was he imagining things? Could all this have

anything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out

that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t

think he could bear it.

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep

quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over

in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell

asleep was that even if the Potters were involved,

there was no reason for them to come near him and

Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and

Petunia thought about them and their kind. ... He

couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up

in anything that might be going on — he yawned and

turned over — it couldn’t affect them. ...

How very wrong he was.

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy

sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no

sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue,

its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet

Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door

slammed on the next street, nor when two owls

swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight

before the cat moved at all.

A man appeared on the corner the cat had been

watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d

have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The

cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet

Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the

silver of his hair and beard, which were both long

 

enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long

robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and

high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,

bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles

and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it

had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was

Albus Dumbledore.

Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had

just arrived in a street where everything from his

name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy

rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But

he did seem to realize he was being watched, because

he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still

staring at him from the other end of the street. For

some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse

him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have

known.”

He found what he was looking for in his inside

pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He

flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.

The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He

clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into

darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,

until the only lights left on the whole street were two

tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of

the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their

window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they

wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening

down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-

Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the

street toward number four, where he sat down on the

wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a

moment he spoke to it.

“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”

 

He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.

Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking

woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the

shape of the markings the cat had had around its

eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.

Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She

looked distinctly ruffled.

“How did you know it was me?” she asked.

“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”

“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all

day,” said Professor McGonagall.

“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I

must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my

way here.”

Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said

impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful,

but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s

going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head

back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I

heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well,

they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to

notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll

bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much

sense.”

“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently.

“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven

years.”

“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.

“But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are

being downright careless, out on the streets in broad

 

daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,

swapping rumors.”

She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore

here, as though hoping he was going to tell her

something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine

thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who

seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found

out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,

Dumbledore?”

“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have

much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon

drop?”

“A what?”

“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m

rather fond of.”

“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as

though she didn’t think this was the moment for

lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has

gone — ”

“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like

yourself can call him by his name? All this You-

Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been

trying to persuade people to call him by his proper

name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but

Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,

seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we

keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any

reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.”

“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall,

sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re

different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-

Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”

 

“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort

had powers I will never have.”

“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use

them.”

“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since

Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.”

Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at

Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to

the rumors that are flying around. You know what

everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared?

About what finally stopped him?”

It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the

point she was most anxious to discuss, the real

reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all

day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she

fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she

did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was

saying, she was not going to believe it until

Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore,

however, was choosing another lemon drop and did

not answer.

“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last

night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He

went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and

James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.”

Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall

gasped.

“Lily and James ... I can’t believe it ... I didn’t want to

believe it ... Oh, Albus ...”

Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the

shoulder. “I know ... I know ...” he said heavily.

 

Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went

on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the

Potters’ son, Harry. But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t

kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but

they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter,

Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why

he’s gone.”

Dumbledore nodded glumly.

“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After

all he’s done ... all the people he’s killed ... he couldn’t

kill a little boy? It’s just astounding ... of all the

things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven

did Harry survive?”

“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may

never know.”

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief

and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.

Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden

watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very

odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers;

instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It

must have made sense to Dumbledore, though,

because he put it back in his pocket and said,

“Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be

here, by the way?”

“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t

suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all

places?”

“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.

They’re the only family he has left now.”

“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who

live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her

 

feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you

can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t

find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got

this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way

up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter

come and live here!”

“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly.

“His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything

to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.”

“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly,

sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore,

you think you can explain all this in a letter? These

people will never understand him! He’ll be famous —

a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was

known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will

be books written about Harry — every child in our

world will know his name!”

“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously

over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be

enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can

walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even

remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be,

growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take

it?”

Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her

mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re

right, of course. But how is the boy getting here,

Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though

she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.

“Hagrid’s bringing him.”

“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with

something as important as this?”

 

“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.

“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said

Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t

pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what

was that?”

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around

them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and

down the street for some sign of a headlight; it

swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky —

and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed

on the road in front of them.

If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man

sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a

normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked

simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long

tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his

face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his

feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In

his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of

blankets.

“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At

last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”

“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the

giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he

spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him,

sir.”

“No problems, were there?”

“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him

out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’

around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.”

 

Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward

over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a

baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair

over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped

cut, like a bolt of lightning.

“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Hell have that scar forever.”

“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”

“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy.

I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect

map of the London Underground. Well — give him

here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned

toward the Dursleys’ house.

“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked

Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry

and gave him what must have been a very scratchy,

whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl

like a wounded dog.

“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the

Muggles!”

“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted

handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-

can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little

Harry off ter live with Muggles — ”

“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself,

Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall

whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as

Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and

walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the

 

doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it

inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the

other two. For a full minute the three of them stood

and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders

shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and

the twinkling light that usually shone from

Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.

“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no

business staying here. We may as well go and join the

celebrations.”

“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best

get this bike away. G ’night, Professor McGonagall —

Professor Dumbledore, sir.”

Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid

swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the

engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off

into the night.

“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,”

said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor

McGonagall blew her nose in reply.

Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.

On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-

Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light

sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive

glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a

tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end

of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets

on the step of number four.

“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his

heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which

lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last

 

place you would expect astonishing things to happen.

Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without

waking up. One small hand closed on the letter

beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was

special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he

would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs.

Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put

out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next

few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin

Dudley. ... He couldn’t know that at this very

moment, people meeting in secret all over the country

were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed

voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”

 

THE VANASHIG GLASS

Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had

woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but

Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose

on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass

number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into

their living room, which was almost exactly the same

as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had

seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the

photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how

much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been

lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach

ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley

Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the

photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first

bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer

game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his

mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy

lived in the house, too.

Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment,

but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it

 

was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the

day.

“Up! Get up! Now!”

Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door

again.

“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward

the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan

being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and

tried to remember the dream he had been having. It

had been a good one. There had been a flying

motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the

same dream before.

His aunt was back outside the door.

“Are you up yet?” she demanded.

“Nearly,” said Harry.

“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the

bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want

everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”

Harry groaned.

“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the

door.

“Nothing, nothing ...”

Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten?

Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for

socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after

pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry

was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the

stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.

 

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the

kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all

Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though

Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not

to mention the second television and the racing bike.

Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a

mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated

exercise — unless of course it involved punching

somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry,

but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it,

but he was very fast.

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark

cupboard, but Harry had always been small and

skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and

skinnier than he really was because all he had to

wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was

about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin

face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green

eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot

of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had

punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked

about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his

forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He

had had it as long as he could remember, and the

first question he could ever remember asking his

Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had

said. “And don’t ask questions.”

Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a

quiet life with the Dursleys.

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was

turning over the bacon.

“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning

greeting.

 

About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top

of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a

haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the

rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made

no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over

the place.

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in

the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like

Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much

neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair

that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia

often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel —

Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a

wig.

Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table,

which was difficult as there wasn’t much room.

Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His

face fell.

“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and

father. “That’s two less than last year.”

“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present,

see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and

Daddy.”

“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red

in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley

tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as

fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.

Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because

she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two

presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin?

Two more presents. Is that all right?”

 

Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard

work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty ...

thirty ...”

“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.

“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the

nearest parcel. “All right then.”

Uncle Vernon chuckled.

“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his

father. ’Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair.

At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia

went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon

watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video

camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new

computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the

paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came

back from the telephone looking both angry and

worried.

“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her

leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in

Harry’s direction.

Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart

gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his

parents took him and a friend out for the day, to

adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the

movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs.

Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.

Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of

cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs

of all the cats she’d ever owned.

“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at

Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he

 

ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg,

but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would

be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies,

Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.

“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.

“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”

The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as

though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was

something very nasty that couldn’t understand them,

like a slug.

“What about what’s-her-name, your friend —

Yvonne?”

“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.

“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully

(he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television

for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s

computer) .

Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a

lemon.

“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she

snarled.

“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they

weren’t listening.

“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt

Petunia slowly, "... and leave him in the car. ...”

“That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. ...”

 

Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really

crying — it had been years since he’d really cried —

but he knew that if he screwed up his face and

wailed, his mother would give him anything he

wanted.

“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him

spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms

around him.

“I ... don’t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!” Dudley

yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-

spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through

the gap in his mothers arms.

Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord,

they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a

moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss,

walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy

with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who

held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley

hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.

Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his

luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with

Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first

time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able

to think of anything else to do with him, but before

they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.

“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large

purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you

now, boy — any funny business, anything at all —

and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until

Christmas.”

I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly

 

But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.

The problem was, strange things often happened

around Harry and it was just no good telling the

Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.

Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from

the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all,

had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair

so short he was almost bald except for his bangs,

which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had

laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless

night imagining school the next day, where he was

already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped

glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to

find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt

Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week

in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to

explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown

back so quickly.

Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force

him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown

with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it

over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until

finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but

certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided

it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great

relief, Harry wasn’t punished.

On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble

for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.

Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when,

as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he

was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had

received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress

telling them Harry had been climbing school

buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at

Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his

 

cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans

outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the

wind must have caught him in mid-jump.

But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even

worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the

day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or

Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.

While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt

Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at

work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry

were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,

it was motorcycles.

"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,”

he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.

“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry,

remembering suddenly. “It was flying.”

Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He

turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry,

his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:

“MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!”

Dudley and Piers sniggered.

“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”

But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was

one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his

asking questions, it was his talking about anything

acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a

dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he

might get dangerous ideas.

It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was

crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley

 

and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance

and then, because the smiling lady in the van had

asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry

him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It

wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they

watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked

remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.

Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time.

He was careful to walk a little way apart from the

Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting

to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t

fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They

ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a

tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have

enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him

another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.

Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it

was all too good to last.

After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool

and dark in there, with lit windows all along the

walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes

were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and

stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge,

poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.

Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It

could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle

Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at

the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was

fast asleep.

Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass,

staring at the glistening brown coils.

“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon

tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.

 

“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped

the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake

just snoozed on.

“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.

Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently

at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it

had died of boredom itself — no company except

stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass

trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than

having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only

visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to

wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the

house.

The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly,

very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a

level with Harry’s.

It winked.

Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if

anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back

at the snake and winked, too.

The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and

Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave

Harry a look that said quite plainly:

“I get that all the time.”

“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though

he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be

really annoying.”

The snake nodded vigorously.

“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.

 

The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the

glass. Harry peered at it.

Boa Constrictor, Brazil.

“Was it nice there?”

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again

and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the

zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?”

As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout

behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY!

MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE!

YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”

Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he

could.

“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the

ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the

concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no

one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and

Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the

next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.

Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa

constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was

uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor.

People throughout the reptile house screamed and

started running for the exits.

As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have

sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.

... Thanksss, amigo.”

The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.

 

“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass

go?” "

The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of

strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over

again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as

Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything

except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but

by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car,

Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off

his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to

squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at

least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry

was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”

Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the

house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he

could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go —

cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed

into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get

him a large brandy.

Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing

he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and

he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.

Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the

kitchen for some food.

He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten

miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever

since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in

that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car

when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he

strained his memory during long hours in his

cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a

blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his

forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though

he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came

from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His

 

aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of

course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were

no photographs of them in the house.

When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and

dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take

him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys

were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or

maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to

know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A

tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once

while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley.

After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt

Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without

buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed

all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.

A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually

shaken his hand in the street the other day and then

walked away without a word. The weirdest thing

about all these people was the way they seemed to

vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.

At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that

Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his

baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody

liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.

 

3

THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE

The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned

Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he

was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer

holidays had started and Dudley had already broken

his new video camera, crashed his remote control

airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike,

knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet

Drive on her crutches.

Harry was glad school was over, but there was no

escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every

single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were

all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and

stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of

them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite

sport: Harry Hunting.

This was why Harry spent as much time as possible

out of the house, wandering around and thinking

about the end of the holidays, where he could see a

tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be

going off to secondary school and, for the first time in

 

his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been

accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school,

Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry,

on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the

local public school. Dudley thought this was very

funny.

“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day

at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs

and practice?”

“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had

anything as horrible as your head down it — it might

be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out

what he’d said.

One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London

to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs.

Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out

she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and

she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She

let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of

chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for

several years.

That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room

for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings

boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers,

and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried

knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the

teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be

good training for later life.

As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers,

Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest

moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and

said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins,

he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t

 

trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs

might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.

k k k

There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next

morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed

to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He

went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked

like dirty rags swimming in gray water.

“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips

tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a

question.

“Your new school uniform,” she said.

Harry looked in the bowl again.

“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”

“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing

some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just

like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.”

Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not

to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to

think about how he was going to look on his first day

at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old

elephant skin, probably.

Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with

wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new

uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as

usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which

he carried everywhere, on the table.

They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters

on the doormat.

 

“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from

behind his paper.

“Make Harry get it.”

“Get the mail, Harry.”

“Make Dudley get it.”

“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”

Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the

mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard

from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was

vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope

that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.

Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging

like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole

life, had written to him. Who would? He had no

friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the

library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for

books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so

plainly there could be no mistake:

Mr. H. Potter

The Cupboard under the Stairs

4 Privet Drive

Little Whinging

Surrey

The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish

parchment, and the address was written in emerald-

green ink. There was no stamp.

 

Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry

saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion,

an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large

letter H.

“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the

kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter

bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.

Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his

letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the

postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the

yellow envelope.

Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust,

and flipped over the postcard.

“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny

whelk ...”

“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got

something!”

Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which

was written on the same heavy parchment as the

envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand

by Uncle Vernon.

“That’s mine\” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.

“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon,

shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at

it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of

traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds

it was the grayish white of old porridge.

“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.

 

Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle

Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia

took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment

it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her

throat and made a choking noise.

“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”

They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten

that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley

wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a

sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.

“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.

“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”

“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing

the letter back inside its envelope.

Harry didn’t move.

“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.

“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.

“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry

and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw

them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind

them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but

silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole;

Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one

ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack

between door and floor.

“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering

voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly

know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re

watching the house?”

 

“Watching — spying — might be following us,”

muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.

“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write

back? Tell them we don’t want — ”

Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes

pacing up and down the kitchen.

“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t

get an answer. ... Yes, that’s best ... we won’t do

anything. ...”

“But — ”

“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we

swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that

dangerous nonsense?”

That evening when he got back from work, Uncle

Vernon did something he’d never done before; he

visited Harry in his cupboard.

“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle

Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s

writing to me?”

“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said

Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.”

“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my

cupboard on it.”

“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of

spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep

breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which

looked quite painful.

 

“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt

and I have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit

big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved

into Dudley’s second bedroom.”

“Why?” said Harry.

“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this

stuff upstairs, now.”

The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors

(usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where

Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys

and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It

only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything

he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat

down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly

everything in here was broken. The month-old video

camera was lying on top of a small, working tank

Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s

dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television

set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite

program had been canceled; there was a large

birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley

had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was

up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley

had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They

were the only things in the room that looked as

though they’d never been touched.

From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling

at his mother, “I don’t want him in there ... I need

that room ... make him get out. ...”

Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday

he’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d

rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than

up here without it.

 

Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet.

Dudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his

father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose,

kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through

the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room

back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday

and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall.

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each

other darkly.

When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to

be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get

it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting

stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted,

“There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest

Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive — ’ ”

With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his

seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him.

Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to

get the letter from him, which was made difficult by

the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around

the neck from behind. After a minute of confused

fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the

Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up,

gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his

hand.

“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he

wheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.”

Harry walked round and round his new room.

Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and

they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first

letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this

time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.

The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next

morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed

 

silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole

downstairs without turning on any of the lights.

He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of

Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first.

His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall

toward the front door —

“AAAAARRRGH ! ”

Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something

big and squashy on the doormat — something alive\

Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry

realized that the big, squashy something had been his

uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot

of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making

sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been

trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an

hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea.

Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by

the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into

Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters

addressed in green ink.

“I want — ” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing

the letters into pieces before his eyes.

Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at

home and nailed up the mail slot.

“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a

mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll

just give up.”

“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”

“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways,

Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle

 

Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of

fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.

On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for

Harry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they

had been pushed under the door, slotted through the

sides, and a few even forced through the small

window in the downstairs bathroom.

Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all

the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and

boarded up the cracks around the front and back

doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe

Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at

small noises.

On Saturday, things began to get out of hand.

Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the

house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two

dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had

handed Aunt Petunia through the living room

window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone

calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find

someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the

letters in her food processor.

“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?”

Dudley asked Harry in amazement.

•k k k

On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the

breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.

“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully

as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no

damn letters today — ”

 

Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney

as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of

the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came

pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys

ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch

one —

“Out! OUT!”

Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and

threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and

Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces,

Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could

hear the letters still streaming into the room,

bouncing off the walls and floor.

“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak

calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at

the same time. “I want you all back here in five

minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack

some clothes. No arguments!”

He looked so dangerous with half his mustache

missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later

they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up

doors and were in the car, speeding toward the

highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his

father had hit him round the head for holding them

up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and

computer in his sports bag.

They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t

dare ask where they were going. Every now and then

Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in

the opposite direction for a while.

“Shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,” he would mutter

whenever he did this.

 

They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall

Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day

in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television

programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so

long without blowing up an alien on his computer.

Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-

looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley

and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp,

musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake,

sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of

passing cars and wondering...

They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on

toast for breakfast the next day. They had just

finished when the owner of the hotel came over to

their table.

“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I

got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.”

She held up a letter so they could read the green ink

address:

Mr. H. Potter

Room 1 7

Railview Hotel

Cokeworth

Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon

knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.

“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up

quickly and following her from the dining room.

•k k k

 

“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt

Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle

Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was

looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into

the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook

his head, got back in the car, and off they went again.

The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed

field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the

top of a multilevel parking garage.

“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt

Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had

parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car,

and disappeared.

It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the

car. Dudley sniveled.

“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great

Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with

a television.”

Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was

Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to

know the days of the week, because of television —

then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh

birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly

fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat

hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still,

you weren’t eleven every day.

Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was

also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer

Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.

“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on!

Everyone out!”

 

It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was

pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at

sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most

miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing

was certain, there was no television in there.

“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon

gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this

gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”

A toothless old man came ambling up to them,

pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat

bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.

“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon,

“so all aboard!”

It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain

crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped

their faces. After what seemed like hours they

reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and

sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.

The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of

seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the

wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty.

There were only two rooms.

Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips

each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the

empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said

cheerfully.

He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought

nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a

storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though

the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.

 

As night fell, the promised storm blew up around

them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls

of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy

windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in

the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on

the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off

to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find

the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under

the thinnest, most ragged blanket.

The storm raged more and more ferociously as the

night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and

turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach

rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned

by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight.

The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was

dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told

Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and

watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the

Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the

letter writer was now.

Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak

outside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in,

although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes

to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so

full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to

steal one somehow.

Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard

on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what

was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock

crumbling into the sea?

One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds

... twenty ... ten ... nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley

up, just to annoy him — three ... two ... one ...

BOOM.

 

The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright,

staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking

to come in.

 

THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS

BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.

“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly.

There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon

came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in

his hands — now they knew what had been in the

long, thin package he had brought with them.

“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!”

There was a pause. Then —

SMASH!

The door was hit with such force that it swung clean

off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat

on the floor.

A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His

face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy

mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could

 

make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under

all the hair.

The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so

that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down,

picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its

frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little.

He turned to look at them all.

“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not

been an easy journey. ...”

He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen

with fear.

“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.

Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother,

who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.

“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.

Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face

and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.

“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the

giant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer

mom’s eyes.”

Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.

“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You

are breaking and entering!”

“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the

giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the

gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot

as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw

it into a corner of the room.

 

Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a

mouse being trodden on.

“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back

on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got

summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some

point, but it’ll taste all right.”

From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled

a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with

trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate

cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green

icing.

Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank

you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth,

and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”

The giant chuckled.

“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid,

Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.”

He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s

whole arm.

“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his

hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if

yeh’ve got it, mind.”

His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled

chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the

fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but

when he drew back a second later, there was a

roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with

flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over

him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.

 

The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged

under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things

out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a

squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot,

several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber

liquid that he took a swig from before starting to

make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and

smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while

the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat,

juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley

fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t

touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”

The giant chuckled darkly.

“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’

anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.”

He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry

he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he

still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as

nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,

“I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.”

The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with

the back of his hand.

“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I

told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll

know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.”

“Er — no,” said Harry.

Hagrid looked shocked.

“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.

“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the

Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s

 

them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’

yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even

know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh

never wonder where yer parents learned it all?”

“All what?” asked Harry.

“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one

second!”

He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill

the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against

the wall.

“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys,

“that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ —

about ANYTHING?”

Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to

school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.

“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do

math and stuff.”

But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About

our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’

world.”

“What world?”

Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.

“DURSLEY!” he boomed.

Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered

something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid

stared wildly at Harry.

 

“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he

said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.”

“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were

they?”

“Yeh don’ know ... yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran his

fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a

bewildered stare.

“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.

Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.

“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid

you to tell the boy anything!”

A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have

quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him;

when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with

rage.

“You never told him? Never told him what was in the

letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw

Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from

him all these years?”

“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.

“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.

Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.

“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid.

“Harry — yer a wizard.”

There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and

the whistling wind could be heard.

 

“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.

“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down

on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’

a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained

up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else

would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read

yer letter.”

Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the

yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr.

H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He

pulled out the letter and read:

HOGWARTS SCHOOL

o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY

Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.

Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of

Wizards)

Dear Mr. Potter,

We are pleased to inform you that you have been

accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and

Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary

books and equipment.

Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no

later than July 31.

Yours sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall,

Deputy Headmistress

 

Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks

and he couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few

minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they

await my owl?”

“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid,

clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to

knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket

inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live,

rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of

parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he

scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:

Dear Professor Dumbledore,

Given Harry his letter.

Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.

Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.

Hagrid

Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which

clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw

the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and

sat down as though this was as normal as talking on

the telephone.

Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it

quickly.

“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment,

Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very

angry, moved into the firelight.

“He’s not going,” he said.

Hagrid grunted.

 

“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he

said.

“A what?” said Harry, interested.

“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic

folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a

family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”

“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to

that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp

it out of him! Wizard indeed!”

“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a

wizard?”

“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew\ Of

course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted

sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just

like that and disappeared off to that — that school —

and came home every vacation with her pockets full

of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the

only one who saw her for what she was — a freak!

But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this

and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in

the family!”

She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went

ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all

this for years.

“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and

got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d

be just the same, just as strange, just as — as —

abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got

herself blown up and we got landed with you!”

 

Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his

voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a

car crash!”

“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily

that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How

could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an

outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own

story when every kid in our world knows his name!”

“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.

The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked

suddenly anxious.

“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried

voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there

might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh

didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right

person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t

go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”

He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.

“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh —

mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry,

parts of it. ...”

He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds,

and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a

person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his

name, everyone in our world knows — ”

“Who?”

“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No

one does.”

“Why not?”

 

“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared.

Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard

who went ... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse.

Worse than worse. His name was ...”

Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.

“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.

“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid

shuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this

— this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started

lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid,

some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was

gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry.

Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly

with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things

happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up

to him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only

safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s

the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare

try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.

“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’

wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts

in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-

Who never tried to get ’em on his side before . . .

probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter

want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.

“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em ... maybe

he just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows

is, he turned up in the village where you was all

living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a

year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ”

Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted

handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a

foghorn.

 

“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum

an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway

“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the

real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too.

Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or

maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do

it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer

forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh

get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took

care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it

didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry.

No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one

except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches

an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones,

the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you

lived.”

Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind.

As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the

blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had

ever remembered it before — and he remembered

something else, for the first time in his life: a high,

cold, cruel laugh.

Hagrid was watching him sadly.

“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on

Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...”

“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped;

he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.

Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his

courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were

clenched.

“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept

there’s something strange about you, probably

 

nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as

for all this about your parents, well, they were

weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off

without them in my opinion — asked for all they got,

getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just

what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky

end — ”

But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and

drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat.

Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said,

“I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one

more word ...”

In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella

by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed

again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell

silent.

“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and

sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged

right down to the floor.

Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask,

hundreds of them.

“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-

Know-Who?”

“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same

night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more

famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see ... he was

gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?

“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno

if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say

he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’

believe it. People who was on his side came back ter

 

ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’

reckon they could’ve done if he was cornin’ back.

“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but

lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause

somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was

somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on —

/ dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’

about you stumped him, all right.”

Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect

blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling

pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a

horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he

possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by

Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle

Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they

been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried

to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the

greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had

always been able to kick him around like a football?

“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have

made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”

To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.

“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when

you was scared or angry?”

Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think

about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his

aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when

he, Harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by

Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of

their reach . . . dreading going to school with that

ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow

back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him,

 

hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he

was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?

Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that

Hagrid was positively beaming at him.

“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you

wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.”

But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a

fight.

“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s

going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve

read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish —

spell books and wands and — ”

“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop

him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s

son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been

down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest

school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven

years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with

youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be

under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had,

Albus Dumbled — ”

“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD

FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle

Vernon.

But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his

umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER — ” he

thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE

— IN — FRONT — OF — ME!”

He brought the umbrella swishing down through the

air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet

light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and

 

the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with

his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in

pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a

curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.

Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and

Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified

look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.

Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his

beard.

“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it

didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig,

but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there

wasn’t much left ter do.”

He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy

eyebrows.

“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at

Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do

magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter

follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’

the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — ”

“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.

“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er —

got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year.

They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But

Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great

man, Dumbledore.”

“Why were you expelled?”

“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,”

said Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer

books an’ that.”

 

He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.

“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it

wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in

one o’ the pockets.”

 

DIAGON ALLY

Harry woke early the next morning. Although he

could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.

“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a

giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a

school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at

home in my cupboard.”

There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.

And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry

thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his

eyes. It had been such a good dream.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”

He sat up and Hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off him. The

hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid

himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there

 

was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a

newspaper held in its beak.

Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as

though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He

went straight to the window and jerked it open. The

owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of

Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered

onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid ’s coat.

“Don’t do that.”

Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it

snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on

savaging the coat.

“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl — ”

“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.

“What?”

“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the

pockets.”

Hagrid ’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but

pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of

string, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, Harry

pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.

“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.

“Knuts?”

“The little bronze ones.”

Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl

held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a

 

small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off

through the open window.

Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.

“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter

London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.”

Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking

at them. He had just thought of something that made

him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had

got a puncture.

“Urn — Hagrid?”

“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge

boots.

“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle

Vernon last night ... he won’t pay for me to go and

learn magic.”

“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up

and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents

didn’t leave yeh anything?”

“But if their house was destroyed — ”

“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah,

first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a

sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no

teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”

“Wizards have banks?”

“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”

Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.

 

“Goblins?”

“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh

that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the

safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter

keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’

fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore.

Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly.

“He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him.

Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows

he can trust me, see.

“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”

Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was

quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight.

The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with

a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.

“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around

for another boat.

“Flew,” said Hagrid.

“Flew?”

“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter

use magic now I’ve got yeh.”

They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at

Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.

“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving

Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er

— speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not

mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”

“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic.

Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it

 

twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward

land.

“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?”

Harry asked.

“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his

newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons

guardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta

find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under

London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die

of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter

get yer hands on summat.”

Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read

his newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned

from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone

while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d

never had so many questions in his life.

“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid

muttered, turning the page.

“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he

could stop himself.

“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer

Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so

old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there

was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every

morning, askin’ fer advice.”

“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”

“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles

that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the

country.”

“Why?”

 

“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic

solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left

alone.”

At this moment the boat bumped gently into the

harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and

they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.

Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked

through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t

blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as

anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary

things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See

that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”

“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep

up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?”

“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a

dragon.”

“You’d like one?”

“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”

They had reached the station. There was a train to

London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t

understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the

bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.

People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid

took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a

canary-yellow circus tent.

“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted

stitches.

Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.

 

“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything

yeh need.”

Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t

noticed the night before, and read:

“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered

aloud.

“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.

Harry had never been to London before. Although

Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was

obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary

way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the

Underground, and complained loudly that the seats

were too small and the trains too slow.

 

“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without

magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down

escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with

shops.

Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily;

all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They

passed book shops and music stores, hamburger

restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as

if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an

ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there

really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath

them? Were there really shops that sold spell books

and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge

joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t

known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he

might have thought so; yet somehow, even though

everything Hagrid had told him so far was

unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.

“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky

Cauldron. It’s a famous place.”

It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t

pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was

there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their

eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the

record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the

Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most

peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.

Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him

inside.

For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A

few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny

glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long

pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old

bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a

toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped

 

when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know

Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the

bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual,

Hagrid?”

“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid,

clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and

making Harry’s knees buckle.

“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is

this — can this be — ?”

The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely

still and silent.

“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry

Potter ... what an honor.”

He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward

Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.

“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”

Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking

at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it

without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was

beaming.

Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the

next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands

with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.

“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting

you at last.”

“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”

“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a

flutter.”

 

“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the

name, Dedalus Diggle.”

“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s

top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me

once in a shop.”

“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking

around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He

remembers me!”

Harry shook hands again and again — Doris

Crockford kept coming back for more.

A pale young man made his way forward, very

nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.

“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor

Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”

“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping

Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to

meet you.”

“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”

“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered

Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think

about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?”

He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your

equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-

book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at

the very thought.

But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep

Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get

away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make

himself heard over the babble.

 

“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”

Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time,

and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a

small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but

a trash can and a few weeds.

Hagrid grinned at Harry.

“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even

Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind

you, he’s usually tremblin’.”

“Is he always that nervous?”

“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine

while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a

year off ter get some firsthand experience. ... They say

he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a

nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same

since. Scared of the students, scared of his own

subject — now, where’s me umbrella?”

Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming.

Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall

above the trash can.

“Three up ... two across ...” he muttered. “Right,

stand back, Harry.”

He tapped the wall three times with the point of his

umbrella.

The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in

the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider

and wider — a second later they were facing an

archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway

onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of

sight.

 

“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”

He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped

through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his

shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back

into solid wall.

The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons

outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes —

Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring —

Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.

“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we

gotta get yer money first.”

Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He

turned his head in every direction as they walked up

the street, trying to look at everything at once: the

shops, the things outside them, the people doing their

shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary

was shaking her head as they passed, saying,

“Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.”

A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign

saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech,

Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about

Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window

with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of

them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest

ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling

telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had

never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of

bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell

books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles,

globes of the moon. ...

“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.

 

They had reached a snowy white building that

towered over the other little shops. Standing beside

its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of

scarlet and gold, was —

“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they

walked up the white stone steps toward him. The

goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a

swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry

noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they

walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of

doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon

them:

Enter, stranger, but take heed

Of what awaits the sin of greed,

For those who take, but do not earn,

Must pay most dearly in their turn.

So if you seek beneath our floors

A treasure that was never yours,

Thief, you have been warned, beware

Of finding more than treasure there.

“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said

Hagrid.

A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors

and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred

more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long

counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in

brass scales, examining precious stones through

eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count

 

leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were

showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry

made for the counter.

“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come

ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”

“You have his key, sir?”

“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started

emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a

handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of

numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry

watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of

rubies as big as glowing coals.

“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden

key.

The goblin looked at it closely.

“That seems to be in order.”

“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor

Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out

his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault

seven hundred and thirteen.”

The goblin read the letter carefully.

“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will

have someone take you down to both vaults.

Griphook!”

Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had

crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets,

he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the

doors leading off the hall.

 

“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred

and thirteen?” Harry asked.

“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very

secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me.

More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”

Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who

had expected more marble, was surprised. They were

in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming

torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were

little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled

and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward

them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty

— and were off.

At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting

passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right,

left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The

rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because

Griphook wasn’t steering.

Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them,

but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw

a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted

around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they

plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake

where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the

ceiling and floor.

“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise

of the cart, “what’s the difference between a

stalagmite and a stalactite?”

“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’

ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be

sick.”

 

He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at

last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid

got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his

knees from trembling.

Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke

came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped.

Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver.

Heaps of little bronze Knuts.

“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.

All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t

have known about this or they’d have had it from him

faster than blinking. How often had they complained

how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time

there had been a small fortune belonging to him,

buried deep under London.

Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.

“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained.

“Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine

Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should

be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest

safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven

hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go

more slowly?”

“One speed only,” said Griphook.

They were going even deeper now and gathering

speed. The air became colder and colder as they

hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over

an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the

side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom,

but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff

of his neck.

 

Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.

“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked

the door gently with one of his long fingers and it

simply melted away.

“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be

sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said

Griphook.

“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?”

Harry asked.

“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a

rather nasty grin.

Something really extraordinary had to be inside this

top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned

forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at

the very least — but at first he thought it was empty.

Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up

in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up

and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to

know what it was, but knew better than to ask.

“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to

me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth

shut,” said Hagrid.

One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the

sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where

to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He

didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to

a pound to know that he was holding more money

than he’d had in his whole life — more money than

even Dudley had ever had.

 

“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding

toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions.

“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a

pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them

Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry

entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.

Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all

in mauve.

“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to

speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being

fitted up just now, in fact.”

In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed

face was standing on a footstool while a second witch

pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood

Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over

his head, and began to pin it to the right length.

“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”

“Yes,” said Harry.

“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s

up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had

a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them

off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years

can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into

getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.”

Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.

“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.

“No,” said Harry.

“Play Quidditch at all?”

 

“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth

Quidditch could be.

“ I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to

play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know

what House you 11 be in yet?”

“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.

“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do

they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family

have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d

leave, wouldn’t you?”

“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a

bit more interesting.

“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly,

nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was

standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two

large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.

“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know

something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.”

“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of

servant, isn’t he?”

“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the

boy less and less every second.

“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a

hut on the school grounds and every now and then he

gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire

to his bed.”

“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.

 

“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he

with you? Where are your parents?”

“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel

much like going into the matter with this boy.

“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all.

“But they were our kind, weren’t they?”

“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you

mean.”

“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in,

do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been

brought up to know our ways. Some of them have

never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,

imagine. I think they should keep it in the old

wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”

But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said,

“That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for

an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down

from the footstool.

“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the

drawling boy.

Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid

had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with

chopped nuts).

“What’s up?” said Hagrid.

“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment

and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a

bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When

they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s

Quidditch?”

 

“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know —

not knowin’ about Quidditch!”

“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told

Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.

“ — and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t

even be allowed in — ”

“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh

were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his

parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in

the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.

Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best

I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a

long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what

she had fer a sister!”

“So what is Quidditch?”

“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in

the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch —

played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four

balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”

“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”

“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says

Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ”

“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.

“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly.

“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad

who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.”

“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”

“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.

 

They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called

Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to

the ceiling with books as large as paving stones

bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in

covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a

few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley,

who never read anything, would have been wild to get

his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to

drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses

(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies

with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,

Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor

Vindictus Viridian.

“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”

“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter

use magic in the Muggle world except in very special

circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh

couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot

more study before yeh get ter that level.”

Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron,

either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice

set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a

collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the

Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make

up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and

rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the

floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders

lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs,

and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While

Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a

supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry,

Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at

twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-

black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

 

Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list

again.

“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got

yeh a birthday present.”

Harry felt himself go red.

“You don’t have to — ”

“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer

animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years

ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they

make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want

owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’

everythin’.”

Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl

Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling

and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a

large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep

with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop

stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor

Quirrell.

“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect

you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just

Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands,

Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”

A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really

looking forward to.

The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold

letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine

Wands since 382b. c. A single wand lay on a faded

purple cushion in the dusty window.

 

A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the

shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place,

empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid

sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had

entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new

questions that had just occurred to him and looked

instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly

right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of

his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here

seemed to tingle with some secret magic.

“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped.

Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a

loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the

spindly chair.

An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale

eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the

shop.

“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.

“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be

seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question.

“You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday

she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten

and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow.

Nice wand for charm work.”

Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished

he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.

“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany

wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and

excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father

favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the

wizard, of course.”

 

Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry

were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself

reflected in those misty eyes.

“And that’s where ...”

Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s

forehead with a long, white finger.

“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said

softly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful

wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well,

if I’d known what that wand was going out into the

world to do. ...”

He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted

Hagrid.

“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.

... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”

“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.

“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it

in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander,

suddenly stern.

“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his

feet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added

brightly.

“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander

sharply.

“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he

gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.

“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a

piercing look. “Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.”

 

He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings

out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”

“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.

“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry

from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder

to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he

measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core

of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use

unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the

heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are

the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or

phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will

never get such good results with another wizard’s

wand.”

Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which

was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this

on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the

shelves, taking down boxes.

“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure

crumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr.

Potter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon

heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take

it and give it a wave.”

Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it

around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his

hand almost at once.

“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite

whippy. Try — ”

Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand

when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.

 

“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a

half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”

Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr.

Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands

was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair,

but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the

shelves, the happier he seemed to become.

“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the

perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now —

yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and

phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”

Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his

fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it

swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of

red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,

throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid

whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh,

bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ...

how curious ... how very curious ...”

He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it

in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious

“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”

Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.

“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter.

Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix

whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another

feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed

that you should be destined for this wand when its

brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”

Harry swallowed.

 

“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed

how these things happen. The wand chooses the

wizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great

things from you, Mr. Potter. ... After all, He-Who-

Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes,

but great.”

Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr.

Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for

his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his

shop.

The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry

and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley,

back through the wall, back through the Leaky

Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as

they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how

much people were gawking at them on the

Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-

shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its

cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into

Paddington station; Harry only realized where they

were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.

“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he

said.

He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on

plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around.

Everything looked so strange, somehow.

“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.

Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the

best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his

hamburger, trying to find the words.

“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All

those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor

 

Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don’t know anything

about magic at all. How can they expect great things?

I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m

famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-,

sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”

Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard

and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.

“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough.

Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll

be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve

been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll

have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do,

’smatter of fact.”

Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take

him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an

envelope.

“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September

— King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems

with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll

know where to find me. ... See yeh soon, Harry.”

The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to

watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his

seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he

blinked and Hagrid had gone.

 

THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM

NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS

Harry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun.

True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t

stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle

Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him

to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t

speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they

acted as though any chair with Harry in it were

empty. Although this was an improvement in many

ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.

Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for

company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name

he had found in A History of Magic. His school books

were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late

into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the

open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt

Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because

Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night

before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day

 

on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall,

counting down to September the first.

On the last day of August he thought he’d better

speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s

Cross station the next day, so he went down to the

living room where they were watching a quiz show on

television. He cleared his throat to let them know he

was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the

room.

“Er — Uncle Vernon?”

Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.

“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to

go to Hogwarts.”

Uncle Vernon grunted again.

“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”

Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.

“Thank you.”

He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon

actually spoke.

“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train.

Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?”

Harry didn’t say anything.

“Where is this school, anyway?”

“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first

time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of

his pocket.

 

“I just take the train from platform nine and three-

quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read.

His aunt and uncle stared.

“Platform what?”

“Nine and three-quarters.”

“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no

platform nine and three-quarters.”

“It’s on my ticket.”

“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of

them. You 11 see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take

you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London

tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”

“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying

to keep things friendly.

“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle

Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before

he goes to Smeltings.”

Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was

too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up

and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to

walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d

change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet

again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw

that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then

paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.

Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been

loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had

talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had

set off.

 

They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle

Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and

wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this

was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead,

facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.

“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform

ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the

middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do

they?”

He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic

number nine over one platform and a big plastic

number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle,

nothing at all.

“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even

nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry

turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of

them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry.

What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to

attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d

have to ask someone.

He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention

platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had

never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t

even tell him what part of the country it was in, he

started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being

stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for

the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said

there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away,

muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying

hard not to panic. According to the large clock over

the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on

the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it;

he was stranded in the middle of a station with a

trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard

money, and a large owl.

 

Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you

had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to

get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get

out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s

stand between platforms nine and ten.

At that moment a group of people passed just behind

him and he caught a few words of what they were

saying.

“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ”

Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump

woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming

red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like

Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl.

Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them.

They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear

what they were saying.

“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’

mother.

“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-

headed, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go

“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right,

Percy, you go first.”

What looked like the oldest boy marched toward

platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to

blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy

reached the dividing barrier between the two

platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in

front of him and by the time the last backpack had

cleared away, the boy had vanished.

 

“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.

“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly,

woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell

I’m George?”

“Sorry, George, dear.”

“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he

went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he

must have done so, because a second later, he had

gone — but how had he done it?

Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the

barrier — he was almost there — and then, quite

suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.

There was nothing else for it.

“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.

“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s

new, too.”

She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He

was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands

and feet, and a long nose.

“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t

know how to — ”

“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and

Harry nodded.

“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk

straight at the barrier between platforms nine and

ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into

it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if

you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.”

 

“Er — okay,” said Harry.

He pushed his trolley around and stared at the

barrier. It looked very solid.

He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on

their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked

more quickly. He was going to smash right into that

barrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward

on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier

was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able

to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot

away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash —

It didn’t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his

eyes.

A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform

packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts

Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and

saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had

been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-

Quarters on it. He had done it.

Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the

chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound

here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one

another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble

and the scraping of heavy trunks.

The first few carriages were already packed with

students, some hanging out of the window to talk to

their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed

his cart off down the platform in search of an empty

seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying,

“Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”

“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.

 

A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small

crowd.

“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”

The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the

people around him shrieked and yelled as something

inside poked out a long, hairy leg.

Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found

an empty compartment near the end of the train. He

put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and

heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift

it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and

twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.

“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins

he’d followed through the barrier.

“Yes, please,” Harry panted.

“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”

With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked

away in a corner of the compartment.

“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of

his eyes.

“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly,

pointing at Harry’s lightning scar.

“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?”

“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to

Harry.

“What?” said Harry.

 

“ Harry Potter,” chorused the twins.

“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”

The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself

turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating

in through the train’s open door.

“Fred? George? Are you there?”

“Coming, Mom.”

With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the

train.

Harry sat down next to the window where, half

hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the

platform and hear what they were saying. Their

mother had just taken out her handkerchief.

“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”

The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she

grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.

“Mom — geroff.” He wriggled free.

“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?”

said one of the twins.

“Shut up,” said Ron.

“Where’s Percy?” said their mother.

“He’s coming now.”

The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had

already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts

 

robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge

on his chest with the letter P on it.

“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the

prefects have got two compartments to themselves — ”

“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins,

with an air of great surprise. “You should have said

something, we had no idea.”

“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something

about it,” said the other twin. “Once — ”

“Or twice — ”

“A minute — ”

“All summer — ”

“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.

“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one

of the twins.

“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All

right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl

when you get there.”

She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she

turned to the twins.

“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I

get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up

a toilet or — ”

“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”

“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”

 

“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.”

“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”

“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as

the twins already and his nose was still pink where

his mother had rubbed it.

“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on

the train?”

Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him

looking.

“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in

the station? Know who he is?”

“Who?”

“ Harry Potted”

Harry heard the little girl’s voice.

“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom,

oh please. ...”

“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy

isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really,

Fred? How do you know?”

“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like

lightning.”

“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He

was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the

platform.”

“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what

You-Know-Who looks like?”

 

Their mother suddenly became very stern.

“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As

though he needs reminding of that on his first day at

school.”

“All right, keep your hair on.”

A whistle sounded.

“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys

clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the

window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their

younger sister began to cry.

“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”

“Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.”

“ Georg e\”

“Only joking, Mom.”

The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother

waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying,

running to keep up with the train until it gathered too

much speed, then she fell back and waved.

Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as

the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the

window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He

didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be

better than what he was leaving behind.

The door of the compartment slid open and the

youngest redheaded boy came in.

“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat

opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.”

 

Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He

glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the

window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he

still had a black mark on his nose.

“Hey, Ron.”

The twins were back.

“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train —

Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.”

“Right,” mumbled Ron.

“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce

ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron,

our brother. See you later, then.”

“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the

compartment door shut behind them.

“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.

Harry nodded.

“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and

George’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got —

you know ...”

He pointed at Harry’s forehead.

Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning

scar. Ron stared.

“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?”

“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”

“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.

 

“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing

else.”

“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few

moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized

what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the

window again.

“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found

Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.

“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a

second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk

about him.”

“So you must know loads of magic already.”

The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding

families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked

about.

“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron.

“What are they like?”

“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle

and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard

brothers.”

“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking

gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts.

You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and

Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and

Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a

prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they

still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re

really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the

others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it

first. You never get anything new, either, with five

 

brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand,

and Percy’s old rat.”

Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat

gray rat, which was asleep.

“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever

wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being

made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got

Scabbers instead.”

Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said

too much, because he went back to staring out of the

window.

Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not

being able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had

any money in his life until a month ago, and he told

Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes

and never getting proper birthday presents. This

seemed to cheer Ron up.

"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything

about being a wizard or about my parents or

Voldemort — ”

Ron gasped.

“What?” said Harry.

“ You said You-Know-Who’s name\” said Ron, sounding

both shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you,

of all people — ”

“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the

name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t.

See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn. ... I bet,” he

added, voicing for the first time something that had

 

been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in

the class.”

“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from

Muggle families and they learn quick enough.”

While they had been talking, the train had carried

them out of London. Now they were speeding past

fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a

time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.

Around half past twelve there was a great clattering

outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman

slid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart,

dears?”

Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet,

but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that

he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the

corridor.

He had never had any money for candy with the

Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with

gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars

Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have

Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott’s

Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum,

Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes,

Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things

Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss

anything, he got some of everything and paid the

woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.

Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the

compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.

“Hungry, are you?”

 

“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a

pumpkin pasty.

Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped

it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one

of them apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t

like corned beef.”

“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a

pasty. “Go on — ”

“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She

hasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know,

with five of us.”

“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had

anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share

it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron,

eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes,

and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).

“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a

pack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are

they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would

surprise him.

“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing

Agrippa.”

“What?”

“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs

have cards inside them, you know, to collect —

famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five

hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”

Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up

the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon

glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver

 

hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture

was the name Albus Dumbledore.

“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.

“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said

Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks

Harry turned over his card and read:

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS

Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern

times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his

defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the

discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his

work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.

Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten

pin bowling.

Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his

astonishment, that Dumbledore ’s face had

disappeared.

“He’s gone!”

“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,”

said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again

and I’ve got about six of her ... do you want it? You

can start collecting.”

Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs

waiting to be unwrapped.

“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the

Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.”

 

“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded

amazed. “Weird).”

Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the

picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron

was more interested in eating the frogs than looking

at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry

couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only

Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft,

Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He

finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna,

who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie

Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.

“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned

Harry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every

flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like

chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then

you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George

reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.”

Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully,

and bit into a corner.

“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.”

They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans.

Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry,

curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave

enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron

wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.

The countryside now flying past the window was

becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there

were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.

There was a knock on the door of their compartment

and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on

 

platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked

tearful.

“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”

When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost

him! He keeps getting away from me!”

“Hell turn up,” said Harry.

“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him ...”

He left.

“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d

brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind

you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.”

The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.

“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the

difference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him

yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but

the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look ...”

He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a

very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places

and something white was glinting at the end.

“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway — ”

He had just raised his wand when the compartment

door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but

this time he had a girl with him. She was already

wearing her new Hogwarts robes.

“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said.

She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown

hair, and rather large front teeth.

 

“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron,

but the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the

wand in his hand.

“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”

She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.

“Er — all right.”

He cleared his throat.

“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow,

Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”

He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers

stayed gray and fast asleep.

“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well,

it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells

just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in

my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise

when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of

course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft

there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books

by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m

Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”

She said all this very fast.

Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his

stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course

books by heart either.

“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.

“Harry Potter,” said Harry.

 

“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about

you, of course — I got a few extra books for

background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical

History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and

Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”

“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.

“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out

everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do

either of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been

asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds

by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it,

but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. ...

Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad.

You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll

be there soon.”

And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.

“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said

Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid

spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a

dud.”

“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.

“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling

on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t

know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose

Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put

me in Slytherin.”

“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was

in?”

“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat,

looking depressed.

 

“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are

a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off

Houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that

they’ve left, anyway?”

Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d

finished school.

“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in

Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did

you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily

Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the

Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security

vault.”

Harry stared.

“Really? What happened to them?”

“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t

been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful

Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t

think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course,

everyone gets scared when something like this

happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.”

Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was

starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-

Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of

entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more

comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.

“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.

“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.

“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s

the best game in the world — ” And he was off,

explaining all about the four balls and the positions of

 

the seven players, describing famous games he’d been

to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to

get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry

through the finer points of the game when the

compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t

Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this

time.

Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle

one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s

robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more

interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.

“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train

that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is

it?”

“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys.

Both of them were thickset and looked extremely

mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they

looked like bodyguards.

“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale

boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.

“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”

Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been

hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.

“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who

you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red

hair, freckles, and more children than they can

afford.”

He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some

wizarding families are much better than others,

Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the

wrong sort. I can help you there.”

 

He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry

didn’t take it.

“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself,

thanks,” he said coolly.

Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared

in his pale cheeks.

“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly.

“Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as

your parents. They didn’t know what was good for

them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the

Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.”

Both Harry and Ron stood up.

“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.

“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy

sneered.

“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely

than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot

bigger than him or Ron.

“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve

eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.”

Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to

Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as

touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.

Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp

little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe

and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers

round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally

flew off and hit the window, all three of them

disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were

 

more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps

they’d heard footsteps, because a second later,

Hermione Granger had come in.

“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the

sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers

by his tail.

“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry.

He looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it

— he’s gone back to sleep.”

And so he had.

“You’ve met Malfoy before?”

Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.

“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were

some of the first to come back to our side after You-

Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched.

My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father

didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He

turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with

something?”

“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve

just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he

says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting,

have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get

there!”

“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron,

scowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while we

change?”

“All right — I only came in here because people

outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and

down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice.

 

“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you

know?”

Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the

window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains

and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did

seem to be slowing down.

He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their

long black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you

could see his sneakers underneath them.

A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching

Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your

luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school

separately.”

Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he

saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed

their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined

the crowd thronging the corridor.

The train slowed right down and finally stopped.

People pushed their way toward the door and out on

to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold

night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads

of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice:

“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there,

Harry?”

Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.

“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer

step, now! Firs’ years follow me!”

Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down

what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so

dark on either side of them that Harry thought there

must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much.

 

Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once

or twice.

“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid

called over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.”

There was a loud “Oooooh!”

The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge

of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain

on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry

sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.

“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to

a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore.

Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville

and Hermione.

“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to

himself. “Right then — FORWARD!”

And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once,

gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as

glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great

castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed

nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.

“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached

the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats

carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide

opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a

dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right

underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of

underground harbor, where they clambered out onto

rocks and pebbles.

“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who

was checking the boats as people climbed out of

them.

 

“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his

hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the

rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto

smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded

around the huge, oak front door.

“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times

on the castle door.

 

7

THE SORTING HAT

The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired

witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a

very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this

was not someone to cross.

“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.

“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”

She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so

big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’

house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming

torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too

high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase

facing them led to the upper floors.

They followed Professor McGonagall across the

flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of

hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the

rest of the school must already be here — but

Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a

small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,

 

standing rather closer together than they would

usually have done, peering about nervously.

“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall.

“The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but

before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will

be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very

important ceremony because, while you are here,

your House will be something like your family within

Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your

House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free

time in your House common room.

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,

Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own

noble history and each has produced outstanding

witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your

triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-

breaking will lose House points. At the end of the

year, the House with the most points is awarded the

House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a

credit to whichever House becomes yours.

“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few

minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest

you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can

while you are waiting.”

Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak,

which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s

smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his

hair.

“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said

Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”

She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.

 

“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked

Ron.

“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but

I think he was joking.”

Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of

the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet

— what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t

expected something like this the moment they

arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that

everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking

much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering

very fast about all the spells she’d learned and

wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not

to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never,

not even when he’d had to take a school report home

to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his

teachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door.

Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come

back and lead him to his doom.

Then something happened that made him jump about

a foot in the air — several people behind him

screamed.

“What the — ?”

He gasped. So did the people around him. About

twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back

wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they

glided across the room talking to one another and

hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be

arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was

saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give

him a second chance — ”

“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the

chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and

 

you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what

are you all doing here?”

A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly

noticed the first years.

Nobody answered.

“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at

them. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?”

A few people nodded mutely.

“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old

House, you know.”

“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting

Ceremony’s about to start.”

Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the

ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.

“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first

years, “and follow me.”

Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead,

Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with

Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber,

back across the hall, and through a pair of double

doors into the Great Hall.

Harry had never even imagined such a strange and

splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands

of candles that were floating in midair over four long

tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.

These tables were laid with glittering golden plates

and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long

table where the teachers were sitting. Professor

McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they

 

came to a halt in a line facing the other students,

with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces

staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the

flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among

the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to

avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and

saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard

Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky

outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.”

It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all,

and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the

heavens.

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor

McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front

of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed

wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and

extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in

the house.

Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry

thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing —

noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at

the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there

was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip

near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the

hat began to sing:

“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,

But don’t judge on what you see,

I’ll eat myself if you can find

A smarter hat than me.

You can keep your bowlers black,

 

Your top hats sleek and tall,

For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat

And I can cap them all.

There’s nothing hidden in your head

The Sorting Hat can’t see,

So try me on and I will tell you

Where you ought to be.

You might belong in Gryffindor,

Where dwell the brave at heart,

Their daring, nerve, and chivalry

Set Gryffindors apart;

You might belong in Hufflepuff,

Where they are just and loyal,

Those patient Hufflepuffs are true

And unafraid of toil;

Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,

If you’ve a ready mind,

Where those of wit and learning,

Will always find their kind;

Or perhaps in Slytherin

 

You’ll make your real friends,

Those cunning folk use any means

To achieve their ends.

So put me on! Don’t be afraid l\

And don’t get in a flap\

You’re in safe hands (though I have none)

For I’m a Thinking Cap\”

The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished

its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then

became quite still again.

“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to

Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling

a troll.”

Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot

better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they

could have tried it on without everyone watching. The

hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel

brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If

only the hat had mentioned a House for people who

felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for

him.

Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a

long roll of parchment.

“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and

sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott,

Hannah!”

 

A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of

line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her

eyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause —

“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.

The table on the right cheered and clapped as

Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.

Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at

her.

“Bones, Susan!”

“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan

scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.

“Boot, Terry!”

“RAVENCLAW!”

The table second from the left clapped this time;

several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with

Terry as he joined them.

“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but

“Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor,

and the table on the far left exploded with cheers;

Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.

“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin.

Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d

heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked

like an unpleasant lot.

He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He

remembered being picked for teams during gym at his

old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not

because he was no good, but because no one wanted

Dudley to think they liked him.

 

“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”

“HUFFLEPUFF!”

Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the

House at once, but at others it took a little while to

decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy

next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a

whole minute before the hat declared him a

Gryffindor.

“Granger, Hermione!”

Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat

eagerly on her head.

“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.

A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts

always do when you’re very nervous. What if he

wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with

the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor

McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had

obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on

the train?

When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his

toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool.

The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When

it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still

wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter

to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”

Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called

and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched

his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”

Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle,

looking pleased with himself.

 

There weren’t many people left now.

“Moon” , “Nott” ... , “Parkinson” ... , then a pair of

twin girls, “Path” and “Path” ... , then “Perks, Sally-

Anne” . . . , and then, at last —

“Potter, Harry!”

As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke

out like little hissing fires all over the hall.

“ Potter , did she say?”

“ The Harry Potter?”

The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over

his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a

good look at him. Next second he was looking at the

black inside of the hat. He waited.

“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very

difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind

either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a

nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. ...

So where shall I put you?”

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not

Slytherin, not Slytherin.

“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you

sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in

your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to

greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re

sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”

Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole

hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward

the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been

chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed

 

that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the

Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while

the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got

Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff

he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving

Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it

into a bucket of ice-cold water.

He could see the High Table properly now. At the end

nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave

him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there,

in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair,

sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once

from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on

the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing

in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.

Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous

young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking

very peculiar in a large purple turban.

And now there were only four people left to be sorted.

“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron,

joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,”

became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He

was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers

under the table and a second later the hat had

shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”

Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed

into the chair next to him.

“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley

pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was

made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her

scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.

Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had

only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin

pasties seemed ages ago.

 

Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was

beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if

nothing could have pleased him more than to see

them all there.

“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at

Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like

to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!

Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!

“Thank you!”

He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered.

Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.

“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.

“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard

in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes,

Harry?”

Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him

were now piled with food. He had never seen so many

things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast

chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages,

bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes,

fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy,

ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint

humbugs.

The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but

he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.

Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really

wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate

with a bit of everything except the peppermints and

began to eat. It was all delicious.

“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly,

watching Harry cut up his steak.

 

“Can’t you — ?”

“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said

the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does

miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir

Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service.

Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”

“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My

brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless

Nick!”

“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy

— ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus

Finnigan interrupted.

“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”

Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little

chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.

“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and

pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell

onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone

had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it

properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on

their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head

back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new

Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the

House Championship this year? Gryffindors have

never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have

got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s

becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin

ghost.”

Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a

horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a

gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He

was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to

 

see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating

arrangements.

“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus

with great interest.

“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick

delicately.

When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the

remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving

them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the

desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor

you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate

eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-

0, rice pudding ...

As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk

turned to their families.

“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle.

Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they

were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”

The others laughed.

“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.

“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,”

said Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle

for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me

off my guard and force some magic out of me — he

pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly

drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight.

Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was

hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles

when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue

and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the

way down the garden and into the road. They were all

 

really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy.

And you should have seen their faces when I got in

here — they thought I might not be magic enough to

come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he

bought me my toad.”

On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione

were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right

away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly

interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning

something into something else, of course, it’s

supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting

small, just matches into needles and that sort of

thing — ”).

Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy,

looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was

drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall

was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor

Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a

teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and

sallow skin.

It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher

looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s

eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on

Harry’s forehead.

“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.

“What is it?” asked Percy.

“N-nothing.”

The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder

to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the

teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at

all.

 

“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he

asked Percy.

“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder

he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He

teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone

knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot

about the Dark Arts, Snape.”

Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t

look at him again.

At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor

Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.

“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all

fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to

give you.

“First years should note that the forest on the

grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our

older students would do well to remember that as

well.”

Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction

of the Weasley twins.

“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to

remind you all that no magic should be used between

classes in the corridors.

“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of

the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House

teams should contact Madam Hooch.

“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-

floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds

to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful

death.”

 

Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.

“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.

“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s

odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re

not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of

dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he

might have told us prefects, at least.”

“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school

song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other

teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.

Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was

trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden

ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables

and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.

“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore,

“and off we go!”

And the school bellowed:

“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,

Teach us something please,

Whether we be old and bald

Or young with scabby knees,

Our heads could do with filling

With some interesting stuff,

For now they’re bare and full of air,

Dead flies and bits of fluff,

 

So teach us things worth knowing,

Bring back what we’ve forgot,

Just do your best, we’ll do the rest,

And learn until our brains all rot.”

Everybody finished the song at different times. At last,

only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a

very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their

last few lines with his wand and when they had

finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.

“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic

beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you

trot!”

The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the

chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the

marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again,

but only because he was so tired and full of food. He

was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in

the portraits along the corridors whispered and

pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them

through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and

hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases,

yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just

wondering how much farther they had to go when

they came to a sudden halt.

A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair

ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them

they started throwing themselves at him.

“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A

poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show

yourself.”

 

A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a

balloon, answered.

“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”

There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark

eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-

legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.

“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle

Firsties! What fun!”

He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.

“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I

mean it!” barked Percy.

Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping

the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him

zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.

“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as

they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one

who can control him, he won’t even listen to us

prefects. Here we are.”

At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a

very fat woman in a pink silk dress.

“Password?” she said.

“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung

forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all

scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up —

and found themselves in the Gryffindor common

room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.

Percy directed the girls through one door to their

dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of

 

a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the

towers — they found their beds at last: five four-

posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their

trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk

much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.

“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through

the hangings. “Get off Scabbers! He’s chewing my

sheets.”

Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the

treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.

Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he

had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor

Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling

him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it

was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want

to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried

to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there

was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it —

then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher,

Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there

was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating

and shaking.

He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he

woke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all.

 

THE POTIONS MASTER

“There, look.”

“Where?”

“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”

“Wearing the glasses?”

“Did you see his face?”

“Did you see his scar?”

Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his

dormitory the next day. People lining up outside

classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or

doubled back to pass him in the corridors again,

staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was

trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.

There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at

Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones;

some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some

 

with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to

remember to jump. Then there were doors that

wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled

them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t

really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It

was also very hard to remember where anything was,

because it all seemed to move around a lot. The

people in the portraits kept going to visit each other,

and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.

The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty

shock when one of them glided suddenly through a

door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick

was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the

right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth

two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him

when you were late for class. He would drop

wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from

under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak

up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech,

“GOT YOUR CONK!”

Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the

caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get

on the wrong side of him on their very first morning.

Filch found them trying to force their way through a

door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to

the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He

wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were

trying to break into it on purpose, and was

threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they

were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.

Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-

colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like

Filch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule

in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d

whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two

seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of

 

the school better than anyone (except perhaps the

Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any

of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was

the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a

good kick.

And then, once you had managed to find them, there

were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to

magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your

wand and saying a few funny words.

They had to study the night skies through their

telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn

the names of different stars and the movements of the

planets. Three times a week they went out to the

greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology,

with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout,

where they learned how to take care of all the strange

plants and fungi, and found out what they were used

for.

Easily the most boring class was History of Magic,

which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor

Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen

asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next

morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns

droned on and on while they scribbled down names

and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the

Oddball mixed up.

Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny

little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to

see over his desk. At the start of their first class he

took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name

he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.

Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had

been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to

 

cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking- to

the moment they sat down in her first class.

“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and

dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she

said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave

and not come back. You have been warned.”

Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again.

They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get

started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be

changing the furniture into animals for a long time.

After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each

given a match and started trying to turn it into a

needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione

Granger had made any difference to her match;

Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had

gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare

smile.

The class everyone had really been looking forward to

was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s

lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom

smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to

ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was

afraid would be coming back to get him one of these

days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him

by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of

a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they

believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus

Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had

fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started

talking about the weather; for another, they had

noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban,

and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full

of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected

wherever he went.

 

Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t

miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come

from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any

idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so

much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have

much of a head start.

Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They

finally managed to find their way down to the Great

Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.

“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he

poured sugar on his porridge.

“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron.

“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always

favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”

“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor

McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it

hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of

homework the day before.

Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to

this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on

the first morning, when about a hundred owls had

suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during

breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their

owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their

laps.

Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She

sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of

toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the

other school owls. This morning, however, she

fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar

bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry

tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:

 

Dear Harry,

I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like

to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?

I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an

answer back with Hedwig.

Hagrid

Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see

you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off

again.

It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look

forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to

be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.

At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the

idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of

the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.

Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.

Potions lessons took place down in one of the

dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main

castle, and would have been quite creepy enough

without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all

around the walls.

Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the

roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.

“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new —

celebrity.”

Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle

sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling

the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were

black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s

 

warmth. They were cold and empty and made you

think of dark tunnels.

“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art

of potion-making,” he began. He spoke in barely more

than a whisper, but they caught every word — like

Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a

class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish

wand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe

this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand

the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its

shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that

creep through human veins, bewitching the mind,

ensnaring the senses. ... I can teach you how to bottle

fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t

as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to

teach.”

More silence followed this little speech. Harry and

Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione

Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked

desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a

dunderhead.

“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I

added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of

wormwood?”

Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry

glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was;

Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air.

“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry.

Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer.

“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”

He ignored Hermione ’s hand.

 

“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told

you to find me a bezoar?”

Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it

would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry

didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He

tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who

were shaking with laughter.

“I don’t know, sir.”

“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming,

eh, Potter?”

Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into

those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at

the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember

everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and

Fungi ?

Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.

“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood

and wolfsbane?”

At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching

toward the dungeon ceiling.

“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione

does, though, why don’t you try her?”

A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye,

and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not

pleased.

“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your

information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a

sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the

Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken

 

from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from

most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they

are the same plant, which also goes by the name of

aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?”

There was a sudden rummaging for quills and

parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, “And a point

will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek,

Potter.”

Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the

Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into

pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to

cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,

watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake

fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy,

whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone

to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his

horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a

loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow

managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted

blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone

floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within

seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools

while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion

when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as

angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.

“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion

away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you

added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron

off the fire?”

Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over

his nose.

“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at

Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who

had been working next to Neville.

 

“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add

the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got

it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for

Gryffindor.”

This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to

argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.

“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can

turn very nasty.”

As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour

later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were

low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very

first week — why did Snape hate him so much?

“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points

off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid

with you?”

At five to three they left the castle and made their way

across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden

house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow

and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.

When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling

from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid ’s

voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.”

Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he

pulled the door open.

“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”

He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar

of an enormous black boarhound.

There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants

were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was

 

boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a

massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.

“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of

Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started

licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as

fierce as he looked.

“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring

boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock

cakes onto a plate.

“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s

freckles. “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers

away from the forest.”

The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins

that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron

pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all

about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on

Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes.

Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call

Filch “that old git.”

“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce

her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up

ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get

rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”

Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like

Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape

liked hardly any of the students.

“But he seemed to really hate me.”

“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”

 

Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t

quite meet his eyes when he said that.

“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I

liked him a lot — great with animals.”

Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on

purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s

work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper

that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was

a cutting from the Daily Prophet :

GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST

Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts

on 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark

wizards or witches unknown.

Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had

been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact

been emptied the same day.

“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep

your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said

a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.

Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that

someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t

mentioned the date.

“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in

happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening

while we were there!”

There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t

meet Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered

him another rock cake. Harry read the story again.

The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied

earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven

 

hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying,

taking out that grubby little package. Had that been

what the thieves were looking for?

As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for

dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes

they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that

none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as

much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid

collected that package just in time? Where was it

now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape

that he didn’t want to tell Harry?

THE MIDNIGHT DUEL

Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he

hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met

Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had

Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put

up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until

they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor

common room that made them all groan. Flying

lessons would be starting on Thursday — and

Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.

“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always

wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in

front of Malfoy.”

He had been looking forward to learning to fly more

than anything else.

“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,”

said Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always

going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet

that’s all talk.”

 

Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He

complained loudly about first years never getting on

the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful

stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly

escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only

one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d

spent most of his childhood zooming around the

countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell

anyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a

hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from

wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.

Ron had already had a big argument with Dean

Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.

Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with

only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry

had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham

soccer team, trying to make the players move.

Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life,

because his grandmother had never let him near one.

Privately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because

Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of

accidents even with both feet on the ground.

Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about

flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn’t

learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t

tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all

stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library

book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was

hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything

that might help him hang on to his broomstick later,

but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s

lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.

Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note,

something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of

course. Malfoy ’s eagle owl was always bringing him

 

packages of sweets from home, which he opened

gloatingly at the Slytherin table.

A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his

grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed

them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which

seemed to be full of white smoke.

“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I

forget things — this tells you if there’s something

you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this

and if it turns red — oh ...” His face fell, because the

Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “... you’ve

forgotten something ...”

Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten

when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor

table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.

Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half

hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor

McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any

teacher in the school, was there in a flash.

“What’s going on?”

“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.”

Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall

back on the table.

“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with

Crabbe and Goyle behind him.

At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the

other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto

the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear,

breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as

they marched down the sloping lawns toward a

 

smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds

to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying

darkly in the distance.

The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty

broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry

had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about

the school brooms, saying that some of them started

to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly

to the left.

Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short,

gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.

“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked.

“Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry

up.” "

Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and

some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.

“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called

Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ”

“UP!” everyone shouted.

Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it

was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had

simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t

moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell

when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a

quaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that

he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.

Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their

brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up

and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and

Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been

doing it wrong for years.

 

“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the

ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your

brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight

back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle

— three — two — ”

But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of

being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the

whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.

“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising

straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve

feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face

look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,

slip sideways off the broom and —

WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay

facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was

still rising higher and higher, and started to drift

lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.

Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as

white as his.

“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on,

boy — it’s all right, up you get.”

She turned to the rest of the class.

“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the

hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are

or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say

‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”

Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist,

hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm

around him.

 

No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst

into laughter.

“Did you see his face, the great lump?”

The other Slytherins joined in.

“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.

“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy

Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought

you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”

“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching

something out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing

Longbottom’s gran sent him.”

The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.

“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone

stopped talking to watch.

Malfoy smiled nastily.

“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find

— how about — up a tree?”

“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto

his broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he

could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost

branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it,

Potter!”

Harry grabbed his broom.

“iVo!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told

us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.”

 

Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears.

He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the

ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his

hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in

a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something

he could do without being taught — this was easy,

this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a

little to take it even higher, and heard screams and

gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring

whoop from Ron.

He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in

midair. Malfoy looked stunned.

“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that

broom!”

“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking

worried.

Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward

and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it

shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got

out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-

face and held the broom steady. A few people below

were clapping.

“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck,

Malfoy,” Harry called.

The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.

“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw

the glass ball high into the air and streaked back

toward the ground.

Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up

in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward

and pointed his broom handle down — next second

 

he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball

— wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the

screams of people watching — he stretched out his

hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in

time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently

onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in

his fist.

“HARRY POTTER!”

His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor

McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his

feet, trembling.

“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ”

Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with

shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare

you — might have broken your neck — ”

“It wasn’t his fault, Professor — ”

“Be quiet, Miss Patil — ”

“But Malfoy — ”

“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.”

Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s

triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in

Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the

castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it.

He wanted to say something to defend himself, but

there seemed to be something wrong with his voice.

Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without

even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now

he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be

packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the

Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?

 

Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside,

and still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to

him. She wrenched open doors and marched along

corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her.

Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He

thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as

gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant.

His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron

and the others becoming wizards while he stumped

around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.

Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom.

She opened the door and poked her head inside.

“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood

for a moment?”

Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane

she was going to use on him?

But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year

boy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking

confused.

“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and

they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking

curiously at Harry.

“In here.”

Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom

that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy

writing rude words on the blackboard.

“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk

into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out

cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door

behind him and turned to face the two boys.

 

“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a

Seeker.”

Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to

delight.

“Are you serious, Professor?”

“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The

boy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was

that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?”

Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was

going on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and

some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.

“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot

dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even

scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done

it.”

Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had

come true at once.

“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked

excitedly.

“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor

McGonagall explained.

“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now

walking around Harry and staring at him. “Light —

speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom,

Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a

Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”

“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we

can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need

a better team than last year. Flattened in that last

 

match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in

the face for weeks. ...”

Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses

at Harry.

“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may

change my mind about punishing you.”

Then she suddenly smiled.

“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He

was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”

“You’re joking.”

It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron

what had happened when he’d left the grounds with

Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and

kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all

about it.

“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must

be the youngest House player in about — ”

“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his

mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the

excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.”

Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and

gaped at Harry.

“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t

tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.”

Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall,

spotted Harry, and hurried over.

 

“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us.

We’re on the team too — Beaters.”

“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for

sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since

Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be

brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost

skipping when he told us.”

“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s

found a new secret passageway out of the school.”

“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the

Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.”

Fred and George had hardly disappeared when

someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked

by Crabbe and Goyle.

“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the

train back to the Muggles?”

“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the

ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,”

said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all

little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table

was full of teachers, neither of them could do more

than crack their knuckles and scowl.

“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy.

“Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only —

no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a

wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”

“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m

his second, who’s yours?”

Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.

 

“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? Well meet you

in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.”

When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each

other.

“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do

you mean, you’re my second?”

“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said

Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie.

Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly,

“But people only die in proper duels, you know, with

real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do

is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows

enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he

expected you to refuse, anyway.”

“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”

“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron

suggested.

“Excuse me.”

They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.

“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.

Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.

“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy

were saying — ”

“Bet you could,” Ron muttered.

“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school

at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if

 

you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very

selfish of you.”

“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.

“Good-bye,” said Ron.

All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end

to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later

listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville

wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent

all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to

curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t

remember how to block them.” There was a very good

chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs.

Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck,

breaking another school rule today. On the other

hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of

the darkness — this was his big chance to beat

Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.

“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better

go.”

They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their

wands, and crept across the tower room, down the

spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common

room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace,

turning all the armchairs into hunched black

shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole

when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I

can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.”

A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger,

wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.

“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!”

 

“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped,

“Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.”

Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.

“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the

portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.

Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She

followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at

them like an angry goose.

“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care

about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the

House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from

Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching

Spells.”

“Go away.”

“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what

I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow,

you’re so — ”

But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione

had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back

inside and found herself facing an empty painting.

The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and

Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.

“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.

“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go,

we’re going to be late.”

They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor

when Hermione caught up with them.

“I’m coming with you,” she said.

 

“You are not.”

“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for

Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell

him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you

can back me up.”

“You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly.

“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard

something.”

It was a sort of snuffling.

“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the

dark.

It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up

on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake

as they crept nearer.

“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for

hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get

in to bed.”

“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig

snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone

off somewhere.”

“How’s your arm?” said Harry.

“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey

mended it in about a minute.”

“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be

somewhere, we’ll see you later — ”

 

“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet,

“I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s

been past twice already.”

Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at

Hermione and Neville.

“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve

learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us

about, and used it on you.”

Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron

exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry

hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all

forward.

They flitted along corridors striped with bars of

moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry

expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they

were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor

and tiptoed toward the trophy room.

Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal

trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught

them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver

and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls,

keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the

room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in

and started at once. The minutes crept by.

“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.

Then a noise in the next room made them jump.

Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard

someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.

“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a

corner.”

 

It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck,

Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as

quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the

door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had

barely whipped round the corner when they heard

Filch enter the trophy room.

“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter,

“probably hiding.”

“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and,

petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full

of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting

nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak

and broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed Ron

around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right

into a suit of armor.

The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the

whole castle.

“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted

down the gallery, not looking back to see whether

Filch was following — they swung around the

doorpost and galloped down one corridor then

another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where

they were or where they were going — they ripped

through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden

passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their

Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from

the trophy room.

“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against

the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was

bent double, wheezing and spluttering.

“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the

stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.”

 

“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron,

“quickly as possible.”

“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You

realize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet

you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the

trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”

Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t

going to tell her that.

“Let’s go.”

It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone

more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled

and something came shooting out of a classroom in

front of them.

It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a

squeal of delight.

“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown

out.”

Peeves cackled.

“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut,

tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.”

“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”

“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity

voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your

own good, you know.”

“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at

Peeves — this was a big mistake.

 

“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed,

“STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS

CORRIDOR!”

Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right

to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a

door — and it was locked.

“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at

the door, “We’re done for! This is the end!”

They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he

could toward Peeves ’s shouts.

“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed

Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered,

“Alohomora\”

The lock clicked and the door swung open — they

piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their

ears against it, listening.

“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying.

“Quick, tell me.”

“Say ‘please.’ ”

“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”

“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said

Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.

“All right — please.”

“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing

if you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they

heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch

cursing in rage.

 

“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I

think well be okay — get off Neville!” For Neville had

been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the

last minute. “What?”

Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what.

For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a

nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything

that had happened so far.

They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They

were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third

floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.

They were looking straight into the eyes of a

monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space

between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three

pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and

quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths,

saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.

It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them,

and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t

already dead was that their sudden appearance had

taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over

that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous

growls meant.

Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and

death, he’d take Filch.

They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut,

and they ran, they almost flew, back down the

corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them

somewhere else, because they didn’t see him

anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to

do was put as much space as possible between them

and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they

 

reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh

floor.

“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked,

looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders

and their flushed, sweaty faces.

“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted

Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They

scrambled into the common room and collapsed,

trembling, into armchairs.

It was a while before any of them said anything.

Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again.

“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing

like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If

any dog needs exercise, that one does.”

Hermione had got both her breath and her bad

temper back again.

“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she

snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on?”

“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its

feet, I was too busy with its heads.”

“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s

obviously guarding something.”

She stood up, glaring at them.

“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all

have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you

don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”

Ron stared after her, his mouth open.

 

“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged

her along, wouldn’t you?”

But Hermione had given Harry something else to

think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was

guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said?

Gringotts was the safest place in the world for

something you wanted to hide — except perhaps

Hogwarts.

It looked as though Harry had found out where the

grubby little package from vault seven hundred and

thirteen was.

HALLOWEEN

Malfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that

Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day,

looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the

next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting

the three-headed dog had been an excellent

adventure, and they were quite keen to have another

one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the

package that seemed to have been moved from

Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time

wondering what could possibly need such heavy

protection.

“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said

Ron.

“Or both,” said Harry.

But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious

object was that it was about two inches long, they

didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was

without further clues.

 

Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest

interest in what lay underneath the dog and the

trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near

the dog again.

Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and

Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they

saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted

now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their

great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail

about a week later.

As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual,

everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long,

thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry

was just as interested as everyone else to see what

was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the

owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him,

knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly

fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a

letter on top of the parcel.

Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky,

because it said:

DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.

It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I

don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a

broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will

meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven

o’clock for your first training session.

Professor M. McGonagall

Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the

note to Ron to read.

 

“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously.

“I’ve never even touched one.”

They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the

broomstick in private before their first class, but

halfway across the entrance hall they found the way

upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized

the package from Harry and felt it.

“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to

Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.

“You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t

allowed them.”

Ron couldn’t resist it.

“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus

Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home,

Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry.

“Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same

league as the Nimbus.”

“What would you know about it, Weasley, you

couldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back.

“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up

twig by twig.”

Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared

at Malfoy’s elbow.

“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.

“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said

Malfoy quickly.

“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick,

beaming at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all

about the special circumstances, Potter. And what

model is it?”

 

“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting

not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face.

“And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,”

he added.

Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their

laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion.

“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the

top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen

Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team. ...”

“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking

rules?” came an angry voice from just behind them.

Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking

disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.

“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.

“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so

much good.”

Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.

Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his

lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the

dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under

his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where

he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his

dinner that evening without noticing what he was

eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap

the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.

“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto

Harry’s bedspread.

Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different

brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and

shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of

 

neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand

written in gold near the top.

As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and

set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d

never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of

seats were raised in stands around the field so that

the spectators were high enough to see what was

going on. At either end of the field were three golden

poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of

the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles

through, except that they were fifty feet high.

Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry

mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the

ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of

the goal posts and then sped up and down the field.

The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he

wanted at his lightest touch.

“Hey, Potter, come down!”

Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large

wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to

him.

“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what

McGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I’m

just going to teach you the rules this evening, then

you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”

He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized

balls.

“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to

understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are

seven players on each side. Three of them are called

Chasers.”

 

“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a

bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.

“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The

Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and

get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten

points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the

hoops. Follow me?”

“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through

the hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of

like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t

it?”

“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.

“Never mind,” said Harry quickly.

“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called

the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly

around our hoops and stop the other team from

scoring.”

“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was

determined to remember it all. “And they play with

the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He

pointed at the three balls left inside the box.

“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”

He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short

baseball bat.

“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood

said. “These two are the Bludgers.”

He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and

slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed

 

that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps

holding them inside the box.

“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and

freed one of the Bludgers.

At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then

pelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with

the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it

zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their

heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it

and managed to pin it to the ground.

“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger

back into the crate and strapping it down safely. “The

Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off

their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on

each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their

job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and

knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve

got all that?”

“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the

Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the

Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off.

“Very good,” said Wood.

“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry

asked, hoping he sounded offhand.

“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken

jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last

member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And

you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the

Bludgers — ”

“ — unless they crack my head open.”

 

“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for

the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human

Bludgers themselves.”

Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth

and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the

Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut.

It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver

wings.

“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the

most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch

because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the

Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out

of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get

it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever

Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra

hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.

That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of

Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it

can go on for ages — I think the record is three

months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so

the players could get some sleep.

“Well, that’s it — any questions?”

Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to

do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the

problem.

“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood,

carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too

dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of

these.”

He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket

and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the

air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could

in every direction for Harry to catch.

 

Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was

delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen

and they couldn’t carry on.

“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,”

said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the

castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better

than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for

England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”

Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what

with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top

of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it

when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts

two months. The castle felt more like home than

Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming

more and more interesting now that they had

mastered the basics.

On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious

smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the

corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced

in Charms that he thought they were ready to start

making objects fly, something they had all been dying

to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom

around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the

class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was

Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville

had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was

to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to

tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.

She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day

Harry’s broomstick had arrived.

“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve

been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick,

perched on top of his pile of books as usual. “Swish

and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the

magic words properly is very important, too — never

 

forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f and

found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his

chest.”

It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and

flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be

sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got

so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set

fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat.

Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more

luck.

“Wingardium Leviosal” he shouted, waving his long

arms like a windmill.

“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap.

“It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and

long.”

“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked

her wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’

Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four

feet above their heads.

“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping.

“Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!”

Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.

“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to

Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded

corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”

 

Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past

him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her

face — and was startled to see that she was in tears.

“I think she heard you.”

“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.

“She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.”

Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t

seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great

Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard

Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione

was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be

left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but

a moment later they had entered the Great Hall,

where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of

their minds.

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and

ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the

tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the

pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on

the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term

banquet.

Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato

when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall,

his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone

stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair,

slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in

the dungeons — thought you ought to know.”

He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.

There was an uproar. It took several purple

firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor

Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.

 

“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the

dormitories immediately!”

Percy was in his element.

“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear

the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind

me, now. Make way, first years coming through!

Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”

“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they

climbed the stairs.

“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,”

said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween

joke.”

They passed different groups of people hurrying in

different directions. As they jostled their way through

a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly

grabbed Ron’s arm.

“I’ve just thought — Hermione.”

“What about her?”

“She doesn’t know about the troll.”

Ron bit his lip.

“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not

see us.”

Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the

other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and

hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They had just

turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps

behind them.

 

“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large

stone griffin.

Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but

Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from

view.

“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he

down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”

“Search me.”

Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor

after Snape ’s fading footsteps.

“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron

held up his hand.

“Can you smell something?”

Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a

mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no

one seems to clean.

And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the

shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at

the end of a passage to the left, something huge was

moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows

and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.

It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a

dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder

with its small bald head perched on top like a

coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with

flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was

incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which

dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.

 

The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.

It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then

slouched slowly into the room.

“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could

lock it in.”

“Good idea,” said Ron nervously.

They edged toward the open door, mouths dry,

praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With

one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam

the door, and lock it.

“Yes!”

Flushed with their victory, they started to run back

up the passage, but as they reached the corner they

heard something that made their hearts stop — a

high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the

chamber they’d just chained up.

“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.

“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.

“ Hermionel” they said together.

It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what

choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted

back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their

panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran

inside.

Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall

opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll

was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the

walls as it went.

 

“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and,

seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against

the wall.

The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It

lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had

made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It

hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club

as it went.

“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the

chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll

didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its

shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again,

turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving

Harry time to run around it.

“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying

to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move,

she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open

with terror.

The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the

troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron,

who was nearest and had no way to escape.

Harry then did something that was both very brave

and very stupid: He took a great running jump and

managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck

from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging

there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit

of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been

in his hand when he’d jumped — it had gone straight

up one of the troll’s nostrils.

Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its

club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second,

the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a

terrible blow with the club.

 

Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled

out his own wand — not knowing what he was going

to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came

into his head: “Wingardium Leviosal”

The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose

high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and

dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s

head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat

on its face, with a thud that made the whole room

tremble.

Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of

breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still

raised, staring at what he had done.

It was Hermione who spoke first.

“Is it — dead?”

“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been

knocked out.”

He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s

nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray

glue.

“Urgh — troll boogers.”

He wiped it on the troll’s trousers.

A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the

three of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a

racket they had been making, but of course, someone

downstairs must have heard the crashes and the

troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall

had come bursting into the room, closely followed by

Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell

 

took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and

sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.

Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was

looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her

look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning

fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s

mind.

“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor

McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked

at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the

air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you

in your dormitory?”

Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked

at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.

Then a small voice came out of the shadows.

“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for

me.”

“Miss Granger!”

Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.

“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I

could deal with it on my own — you know, because

I’ve read all about them.”

Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a

downright lie to a teacher?

“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry

stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out

with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and

fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they

arrived.”

 

Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story

wasn’t new to them.

“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall,

staring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you

foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a

mountain troll on your own?”

Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless.

Hermione was the last person to do anything against

the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to

get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started

handing out sweets.

“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from

Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m

very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all,

you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are

finishing the feast in their Houses.”

Hermione left.

Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.

“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first

years could have taken on a full-grown mountain

troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor

Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.”

They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at

all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief

to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from

anything else.

“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron

grumbled.

“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione ’s.”

 

“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron

admitted. “Mind you, we did save her.”

“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t

locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him.

They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.

“Pig snout,” they said and entered.

The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone

was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione,

however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.

There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of

them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,”

and hurried off to get plates.

But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became

their friend. There are some things you can’t share

without ending up liking each other, and knocking

out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.

 

QUIDDITCH

As they entered November, the weather turned very

cold. The mountains around the school became icy

gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the

ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen

from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on

the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin

overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin

boots.

The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry

would be playing in his first match after weeks of

training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor

won, they would move up into second place in the

House Championship.

Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood

had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry

should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was

playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry

didn’t know which was worse — people telling him

he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be

running around underneath him holding a mattress.

 

It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a

friend. He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through

all his homework without her, what with all the last-

minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them

do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages,

which turned out to be a very interesting read.

Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of

committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had

happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that

Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players,

and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to

happen to them; that although people rarely died

playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish

and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.

Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about

breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her

from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for

it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the

three of them were out in the freezing courtyard

during break, and she had conjured them up a bright

blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.

They were standing with their backs to it, getting

warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at

once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and

Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from

view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.

Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces

caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen

the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to

tell them off anyway.

“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?”

It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.

 

“Library books are not to be taken outside the

school,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from

Gryffindor.”

“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily

as Snape limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with

his leg?”

“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron

bitterly.

The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that

evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next

to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s

Charms homework for them. She would never let

them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her

to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.

Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the

Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about

tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting

up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask

Snape if he could have it.

“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry

had an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were

other teachers listening.

He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked.

There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.

Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was

worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered

inside — and a horrible scene met his eyes.

Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was

holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was

bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape

bandages.

 

“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you

supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at

once?”

Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but —

“POTTER!”

Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his

robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.

“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”

“GET OUT! OUT!”

Harry left, before Snape could take any more points

from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.

“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them.

“What’s the matter?”

In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.

“You know what this means?” he finished

breathlessly. “He tried to get past that three-headed

dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we

saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d

bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a

diversion!”

Hermione’s eyes were wide.

“No — he wouldn’t,” she said. “I know he’s not very

nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something

Dumbledore was keeping safe.”

“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints

or something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I

 

wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he

after? What’s that dog guarding?”

Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the

same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry

couldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he

needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch

match in a few hours — but the expression on

Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy

to forget.

The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The

Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried

sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking

forward to a good Quidditch match.

“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.”

“I don’t want anything.”

“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.

“I’m not hungry.”

Harry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking

onto the field.

“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus

Finnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get

clobbered by the other team.”

“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile

ketchup on his sausages.

By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out

in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many

students had binoculars. The seats might be raised

high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what

was going on sometimes.

 

Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean

the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for

Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the

sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for

President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had

done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then

Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that

the paint flashed different colors.

Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of

the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch

robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .

Wood cleared his throat for silence.

“Okay, men,” he said.

“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.

“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”

“The big one,” said Fred Weasley.

“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.

“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry,

“we were on the team last year.”

“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team

Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know

it.”

He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”

“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”

Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker

room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way,

walked onto the field to loud cheers.

 

Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the

middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her

broom in her hand.

“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said,

once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed

that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the

Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry

thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in

him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering

banner high above, flashing Potter for President over

the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.

“Mount your brooms, please.”

Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.

Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.

Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They

were off.

“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina

Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser

that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ”

“JORDAN!”

“Sorry, Professor.”

The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the

commentary for the match, closely watched by

Professor McGonagall.

“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass

to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last

year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the

Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain

Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint

 

flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc- no,

stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper

Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s

Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive

around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that

must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a

Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s

Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but

he’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by

Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play

by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back

in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and

off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding

Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now,

Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses —

GRYFFINDORS SCORE!”

Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and

moans from the Slytherins.

“Budge up there, move along.”

“Hagrid!”

Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid

enough space to join them.

“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a

large pair of binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t

the same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch

yet, eh?”

“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.”

“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said

Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at

the speck that was Harry.

 

Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game,

squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was

part of his and Wood’s game plan.

“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the

Snitch,” Wood had said. “We don’t want you attacked

before you have to be.”

When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple

of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was

back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught

sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection

from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a

Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a

cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and

Fred Weasley came chasing after it.

“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he

beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.

“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying,

“Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys,

and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a

moment — was that the Snitch?”

A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey

dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his

shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left

ear.

Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived

downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker

Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they

hurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed

to have forgotten what they were supposed to be

doing as they hung in midair to watch.

 

Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little

round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he

put on an extra spurt of speed —

WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors

below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose,

and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on

for dear life.

“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors.

Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered

a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all

the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had

disappeared from sight again.

Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send

him off, ref! Red card!”

“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron.

“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get

shown the red card and you’re out of the game!”

“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him.

Hagrid, however, was on Dean’s side.

“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked

Harry outta the air.”

Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.

“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of

cheating — ”

“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.

“I mean, after that open and revolting foul — ”

 

“Jordan, I’m warning you — ”

“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor

Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a

penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it

away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor

still in possession.”

It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went

spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened.

His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a

split second, he thought he was going to fall. He

gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and

knees. He’d never felt anything like that.

It happened again. It was as though the broom was

trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands

did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry

tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts —

he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out —

and then he realized that his broom was completely

out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t

direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and

every now and then making violent swishing

movements that almost unseated him.

Lee was still commentating.

“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle —

passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face

by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking,

Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...”

The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have

noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It

was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game,

jerking and twitching as it went.

 

“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid

mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. “If I

didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his

broom ... but he can’t have. ...”

Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over

the stands. His broom had started to roll over and

over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then

the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a

wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling

from it, holding on with only one hand.

“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?”

Seamus whispered.

“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t

nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful

Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two

Thousand.”

At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars,

but instead of looking up at Harry, she started

looking frantically at the crowd.

“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced.

“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.”

Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle

of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on

Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.

“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said

Hermione.

“What should we do?”

“Leave it to me.”

 

Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had

disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on

Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost

impossible for him to hang on much longer. The

whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the

Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one

of their brooms, but it was no good — every time they

got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They

dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously

hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the

Quaffle and scored five times without anyone

noticing.

“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.

Hermione had fought her way across to the stand

where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row

behind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she

knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in

front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled

out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen

words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto

the hem of Snape ’s robes.

It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize

that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had

done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar

in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row —

Snape would never know what had happened.

It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able

to clamber back on to his broom.

“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been

sobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.

Harry was speeding toward the ground when the

crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though

 

he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours

— coughed — and something gold fell into his hand.

“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his

head, and the game ended in complete confusion.

“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was

still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no

difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee

Jordan was still happily shouting the results —

Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy

points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He

was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s

hut, with Ron and Hermione.

“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I

saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering,

he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”

“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of

what had gone on next to him in the stands. “Why

would Snape do somethin’ like that?”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another,

wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the

truth.

“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid.

“He tried to get past that three-headed dog on

Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal

whatever it’s guarding.”

Hagrid dropped the teapot.

“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.

“ Fluffy ?”

 

“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie

I met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore

to guard the — ”

“Yes?” said Harry eagerly.

“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly.

“That’s top secret, that is.”

“But Snape’s trying to steal it.”

“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts

teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.”

“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried

Hermione.

The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have

changed her mind about Snape.

“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all

about them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and

Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!”

“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’

know why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape

wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all

three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’

concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’

you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor

Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■”

“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas

Flamel involved, is there?”

Hagrid looked furious with himself.

 

THE MIRROR OF ERISED

Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-

December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in

several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the

Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several

snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around,

bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that

managed to battle their way through the stormy sky

to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by

Hagrid before they could fly off again.

No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the

Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had

roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and

a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.

Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in

the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist

before them and they kept as close as possible to

their hot cauldrons.

“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions

class, “for all those people who have to stay at

 

Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted

at home.”

He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and

Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out

powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had

been even more unpleasant than usual since the

Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had

lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a

wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as

Seeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found

this funny, because they were all so impressed at the

way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking

broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone

back to taunting Harry about having no proper

family.

It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet

Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come

around the week before, making a list of students

who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had

signed up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at

all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d

ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too,

because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania

to visit Charlie.

When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions,

they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.

Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a

loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind

it.

“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his

head through the branches.

“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”

 

“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came

Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. “Are you trying

to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be

gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I

suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a

palace compared to what your family’s used to.”

Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.

“WEASLEY!”

Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.

“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid,

sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.

“Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”

“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules,

Hagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from

Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more.

Move along, all of you.”

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the

tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.

“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s

back, “one of these days, I’ll get him — ”

“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”

“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said

Hagrid. “Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the

Great Hall, looks a treat.”

So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off

to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and

Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas

decorations.

 

“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner,

would you?”

The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and

mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than

twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the

room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering

with hundreds of candles.

“How many days you got left until yer holidays?”

Hagrid asked.

“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me —

Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we

should be in the library.”

“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes

away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden

bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing

them over the branches of the new tree.

“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the

hall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”

“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly.

“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been

trying to find out who he is.”

“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here —

I’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that

dog’s guardin’.”

“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s

all,” said Hermione.

“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?”

Harry added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of

books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just

 

give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name

somewhere.”

“I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly.

“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron,

and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried

off to the library.

They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s

name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how

else were they going to find out what Snape was

trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to

know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might

have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t in

Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable

Magical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from

Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of

Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of

course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of

thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds

of narrow rows.

Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had

decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of

books and started pulling them off the shelves at

random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted

Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel

wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you

needed a specially signed note from one of the

teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he

knew he’d never get one. These were the books

containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at

Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying

advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.

“What are you looking for, boy?”

“Nothing,” said Harry.

 

Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather

duster at him.

“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!”

Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some

story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione

had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam

Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure

she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk

Snape hearing what they were up to.

Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other

two had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful.

They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as

they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t

surprising they’d found nothing. What they really

needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince

breathing down their necks.

Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him,

shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.

“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?”

said Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find

anything.”

“And you could ask your parents if they know who

Flamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.”

“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione.

Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were

having too good a time to think much about Flamel.

They had the dormitory to themselves and the

common room was far emptier than usual, so they

were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They

sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a

toasting fork — bread, English muffins,

 

marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy

expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they

wouldn’t work.

Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This

was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures

were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in

battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like

everything else he owned, it had once belonged to

someone else in his family — in this case, his

grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a

drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had

trouble getting them to do what he wanted.

Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had

lent him, and they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a

very good player yet and they kept shouting different

bits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t

send me there, can’t you see his knight? Send him, we

can afford to lose him.”

On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward

to the next day for the food and the fun, but not

expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in

the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a

small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.

“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry

scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.

“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got

some presents!”

“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to

his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.

Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in

thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To

Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden

 

flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry

blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl.

A second, very small parcel contained a note.

We received your message and enclose your Christmas

present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped

to the note was a fifty-pence piece.

“That’s friendly,” said Harry.

Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.

“ Weird\ ” he said, “What a shape! This is money?”

“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how

pleased Ron was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle —

so who sent these?”

“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron,

turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy

parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any

presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you

a Weasley sweater.”

Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-

knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of

homemade fudge.

“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron,

unwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.”

“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the

fudge, which was very tasty.

His next present also contained candy — a large box

of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.

 

This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt

it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.

Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the

floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.

“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice,

dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten

from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is — they’re

really rare, and really valuable.”

“What is it?”

Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It

was strange to the touch, like water woven into

material.

“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on

his face. “I’m sure it is — try it on.”

Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron

gave a yell.

“It is! Look down!”

Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He

dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection

looked back at him, just his head suspended in

midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the

cloak over his head and his reflection vanished

completely.

“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of

it!”

Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter.

Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen

before were the following words:

 

Your father left this in my possession before he died. It

is time it was returned to you.

Use it well.

A Very Merry Christmas to you.

There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron

was admiring the cloak.

“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,” he said. “Anuthinq.

What’s the matter?”

“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had

sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his

father?

Before he could say or think anything else, the

dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George

Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly

out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone

else yet.

“Merry Christmas!”

“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”

Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one

with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.

“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred,

holding up Harry’s sweater. “She obviously makes

more of an effort if you’re not family.”

“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George

demanded. “Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and

warm.”

 

“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he

pulled it over his head.

“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed.

“I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But

we’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and

Forge.”

“What’s all this noise?”

Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door,

looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway

through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a

lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.

“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all

wearing ours, even Harry got one.”

“I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins

forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses

askew.

“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today,

either,” said George. “Christmas is a time for family.”

They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms

pinned to his side by his sweater.

Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas

dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of

roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;

tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich

gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard

crackers every few feet along the table. These

fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble

Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their

little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.

Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t

just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and

 

engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from

the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several

live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore

had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered

bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor

Flitwick had just read him.

Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey.

Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle

embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting

redder and redder in the face as he called for more

wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the

cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and

blushed, her top hat lopsided.

When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down

with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a

pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-

Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess

set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a

nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs.

Norris’s Christmas dinner.

Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon

having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then,

cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the

fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry

broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to

Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if

Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.

After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle,

and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy

to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy

chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower

because they’d stolen his prefect badge.

It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet

something had been nagging at the back of his mind

 

all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to

think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had

sent it.

Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing

mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon

as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry

leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the

cloak out from under it.

His father’s ... this had been his father’s. He let the

material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light

as air. Use it well, the note had said.

He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and

wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at

his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a

very funny feeling.

Use it well.

Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of

Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement

flooded through him as he stood there in the dark

and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere,

and Filch would never know.

Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him?

Something held him back — his father’s cloak — he

felt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use

it alone.

He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across

the common room, and climbed through the portrait

hole.

“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said

nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.

 

Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing,

and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted

Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long as

he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel

was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight

around him as he walked.

The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a

lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The

lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and

even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it,

the sight gave him the creeps.

The Restricted Section was right at the back of the

library. Stepping carefully over the rope that

separated these books from the rest of the library, he

held up his lamp to read the titles.

They didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold

letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t

understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a

dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The

hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he

was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint

whispering was coming from the books, as though

they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be.

He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down

carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom

shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black

and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out

with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and,

balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.

A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence —

the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but

the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken,

earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked

over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he

 

heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside —

stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran

for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale,

wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry

slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked

off up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in

his ears.

He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of

armor. He had been so busy getting away from the

library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was

going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t

recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of

armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be

five floors above there.

“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if

anyone was wandering around at night, and

somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.”

Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he

was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft,

greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it

was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well,

they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.”

Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape

came around the corner ahead. They couldn’t see

him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if

they came much nearer they’d knock right into him —

the cloak didn’t stop him from being solid.

He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood

ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed

through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it,

and to his relief he managed to get inside the room

without their noticing anything. They walked straight

past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing

deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That

 

had been close, very close. It was a few seconds

before he noticed anything about the room he had

hidden in.

It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes

of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and

there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but

propped against the wall facing him was something

that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that

looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it

out of the way.

It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling,

with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed

feet. There was an inscription carved around the top:

Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.

His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch

and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror,

wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.

He stepped in front of it.

He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself

from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was

pounding far more furiously than when the book had

screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the

mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right

behind him.

But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he

turned slowly back to the mirror.

There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-

looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least

ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but still,

no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was

he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this

mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or

not?

 

He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing

right behind his reflection was smiling at him and

waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind

him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their

reflections were so close together, but he felt only air

— she and the others existed only in the mirror.

She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair

and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry

thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright

green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed

that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same

time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next

to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and

his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just

as Harry’s did.

Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose

was nearly touching that of his reflection.

“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”

They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry

looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror,

and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses

like his, even a little old man who looked as though

he had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was looking at

his family, for the first time in his life.

The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared

hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against

the glass as though he was hoping to fall right

through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of

ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.

How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The

reflections did not fade and he looked and looked

until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.

He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to

 

bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face,

whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the

room.

“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.

“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show

you the mirror.”

“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.

“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys,

you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and

everyone.”

“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just

come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe

it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding

Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why

aren’t you eating anything?”

Harry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and

would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost

forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very important

anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was

guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?

“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”

What Harry feared most was that he might not be

able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered

in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly

the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from

the library, wandering around the dark passageways

for nearly an hour.

“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.”

“IVo!” Harry hissed. “I know it’s here somewhere.”

 

They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the

opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron

started moaning that his feet were dead with cold,

Harry spotted the suit of armor.

“It’s here — just here — yes!”

They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak

from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.

There they were. His mother and father beamed at the

sight of him.

“See?” Harry whispered.

“I can’t see anything.”

“Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...”

“I can only see you.”

“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”

Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the

mirror, he couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron

in his paisley pajamas.

Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.

“Look at me!” he said.

“Can you see all your family standing around you?”

“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older —

and I’m Head Boy!”

“What?”

 

“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and

I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup —

I’m Quidditch captain, too!”

Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to

look excitedly at Harry.

“Do you think this mirror shows the future?”

“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have

another look — ”

“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit

more time.”

“You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s

interesting about that? I want to see my parents.”

“Don’t push me — ”

A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to

their discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they

had been talking.

“Quick!”

Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous

eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and

Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing

— did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an

age, she turned and left.

“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet

she heard us. Come on.”

And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.

The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.

 

“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.

“No.”

“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”

“No ... you go ...”

“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that

mirror. Don’t go back tonight.”

“Why not?”

“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and

anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already.

Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around.

So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into

you? What if you knock something over?”

“You sound like Hermione.”

“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”

But Harry only had one thought in his head, which

was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t

going to stop him.

That third night he found his way more quickly than

before. He was walking so fast he knew he was

making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet

anyone.

And there were his mother and father smiling at him

again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily.

Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the

mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying

here all night with his family. Nothing at all.

Except —

 

“So — back again, Harry?”

Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He

looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the

wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry

must have walked straight past him, so desperate to

get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.

“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”

“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make

you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see

that he was smiling.

“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on

the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you,

have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.”

“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”

“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”

“It — well — it shows me my family — ”

“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”

“How did you know — ?”

“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said

Dumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what the

Mirror of Erised shows us all?”

Harry shook his head.

“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be

able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror,

that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly

as he is. Does that help?”

 

Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us

what we want ... whatever we want ...”

“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us

nothing more or less than the deepest, most

desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never

known your family, see them standing around you.

Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed

by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best

of all of them. However, this mirror will give us

neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away

before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been

driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or

even possible.

“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow,

Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If

you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It

does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,

remember that. Now, why don’t you put that

admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?”

Harry stood up.

“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you

something?”

“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled.

“You may ask me one more thing, however.”

“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”

“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”

Harry stared.

“One can never have enough socks,” said

Dumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone

 

and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on

giving me books.”

It was only when he was back in bed that it struck

Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite

truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved

Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal

question.

 

NICHOLAS FLAMBL

Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking

for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the

Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed

folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he

could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily,

but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over

and over again he dreamed about his parents

disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high

voice cackled with laughter.

“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could

drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about

these dreams.

Hermione, who came back the day before term

started, took a different view of things. She was torn

between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed,

roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had

caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at

least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.

 

They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel

in a library book, even though Harry was still sure

he’d read the name somewhere. Once term had

started, they were back to skimming through books

for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even

less time than the other two, because Quidditch

practice had started again.

Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even

the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t

dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that

Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on

Wood’s side. If they won their next match, against

Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the

House Championship for the first time in seven years.

Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he

had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after

training.

Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice

session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d

just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept

dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off

their brooms.

“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s

exactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match!

Snape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking for

any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”

George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these

words.

“ Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a

mouthful of mud. “When’s he ever refereed a

Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might

overtake Slytherin.”

 

The rest of the team landed next to George to

complain, too.

“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make

sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an

excuse to pick on us.”

Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had

another reason for not wanting Snape near him while

he was playing Quidditch. ...

The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another

as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed

straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where

he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was

the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry

and Ron thought was very good for her.

“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry

sat down next to him, “I need to concern” He caught

sight of Harry’s face. “What’s the matter with you?

You look terrible.”

Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear,

Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden,

sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.

“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.

“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.

“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.

“ Really break your leg,” said Ron.

“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I

back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.”

 

At that moment Neville toppled into the common

room. How he had managed to climb through the

portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs

had been stuck together with what they recognized at

once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to

bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.

Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who

leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville’s

legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.

“What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him

over to sit with Harry and Ron.

“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the

library. He said he’d been looking for someone to

practice that on.”

“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged

Neville. “Report him!”

Neville shook his head.

“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled.

“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron.

“He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no

reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.”

“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be

in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville

choked out.

Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a

Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box

Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to

Neville, who looked as though he might cry.

 

“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The

Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And

where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.”

Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he

unwrapped the frog.

“Thanks, Harry ... I think I’ll go to bed. ... D’you want

the card, you collect them, don’t you?”

As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous

Wizard card.

“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I

ever — ”

He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he

looked up at Ron and Hermione.

“I’ve found him\” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I

told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it

on the train coming here — listen to this:

‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of

the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the

discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his

work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’

Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so

excited since they’d gotten back the marks for their

very first piece of homework.

“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs

to the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had

time to exchange mystified looks before she was

dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.

“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered

excitedly. “I got this out of the library weeks ago for a

bit of light reading.”

 

“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet

until she’d looked something up, and started flicking

frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.

At last she found what she was looking for.

“I knew it! I knew it!”

“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily.

Hermione ignored him.

“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the

only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\”

This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.

“The what?” said Harry and Ron.

“Oh, honestly , don’t you two read? Look — read that,

there.”

She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and

Ron read:

The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with

making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance

with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform

any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of

Life, which will make the drinker immortal.

There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone

over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in

existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted

alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated

his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year,

enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle

(six hundred and fifty-eight).

 

“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had

finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s

Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep

it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew

someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone

moved out of Gringotts!”

“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever

dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it!

Anyone would want it.”

“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study

of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s

not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is

he?”

The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts,

while copying down different ways of treating werewolf

bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d

do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t

until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that

Harry remembered about Snape and the coming

match.

“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I

don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared

to face Snape. I’ll show them ... it’ll really wipe the

smiles off their faces if we win.”

“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,”

said Hermione.

As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became

more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and

Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm,

either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House

Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for

seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such

a biased referee?

 

Harry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not,

but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever

he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape

was following him, trying to catch him on his own.

Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly

torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape

possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s

Stone? Harry didn’t see how he could — yet he

sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could

read minds.

Harry knew, when they wished him good luck

outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron

and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever

see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call

comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep

talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked

up his Nimbus Two Thousand.

Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in

the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand

why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had

both brought their wands to the match. Little did

Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly

practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the

idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready

to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to

hurt Harry.

“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione

muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.

“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”

Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry

aside.

“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever

need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish

 

the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too

much.”

“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley,

peering out of the door. “Even — blimey —

Dumbledore’s come to watch!”

Harry’s heart did a somersault.

“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make

sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that

silver beard.

Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was

safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare

to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.

Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as

the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron

noticed, too.

“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told

Hermione. “Look — they’re off. Ouch!”

Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It

was Malfoy.

“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.”

Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.

“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom

this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you,

Weasley?”

Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded

Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit

a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers

crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry,

 

who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the

Snitch.

“You know how I think they choose people for the

Gryffindor team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes

later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty

for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for.

See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s

the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be

on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”

Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face

Malfoy.

“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but

Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game,

said, “You tell him, Neville.”

“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than

Weasley, and that’s saying something.”

Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking

point with anxiety about Harry.

“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ”

“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !”

“What? Where?”

Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive,

which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.

Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth,

as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.

“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted

some money on the ground!” said Malfoy.

 

Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was

happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to

the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the

back of his seat to help.

“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto

her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape —

she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around

under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from

the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.

Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in

time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing

him by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled

out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch

clasped in his hand.

The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one

could ever remember the Snitch being caught so

quickly.

“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s

won! We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked

Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and

hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.

Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground.

He couldn’t believe it. He’d done it — the game was

over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors

came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land

nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt

a hand on his shoulder and looked up into

Dumbledore’s smiling face.

“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only

Harry could hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been

brooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . .

excellent ...”

 

Snape spat bitterly on the ground.

Jc Jc Jc

Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to

take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the

broomshed. He couldn’t ever remember feeling

happier. He’d really done something to be proud of

now — no one could say he was just a famous name

any more. The evening air had never smelled so

sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the

last hour in his head, which was a happy blur:

Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders;

Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and

down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.

Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the

wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its

windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in

the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Snape. ...

And speaking of Snape . . .

A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of

the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked

as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.

Harry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched.

He recognized the figure’s prowling walk. Snape,

sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at

dinner — what was going on?

Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand

and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw

Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.

The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape

had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower,

brushing the top branches of trees until he heard

 

voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly

in a towering beech tree.

He climbed carefully along one of the branches,

holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through

the leaves.

Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he

wasn’t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t

make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering

worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they

were saying.

"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of

all p-places, Severus ...”

“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his

voice icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about

the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.”

Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling

something. Snape interrupted him.

“Have you found out how to get past that beast of

Hagrid’s yet?”

“B-b-but Severus, I — ”

“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said

Snape, taking a step toward him.

“I-I don’t know what you — ”

“You know perfectly well what I mean.”

An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the

tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say,

“ — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.”

 

“B-but I d-d-don’t — ”

“Very well,” Snape cut in. “Well have another little

chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over

and decided where your loyalties lie.”

He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the

clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see

Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was

petrified.

Jc Jc Jc

“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.

“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping

Harry on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye,

and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-

handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says

he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin!

Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re

having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and

stuff from the kitchens.”

“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s

find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. ...”

He made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting

the door behind them, then he told them what he’d

seen and heard.

“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and

Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He

asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said

something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon

there are other things guarding the stone apart from

Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell

 

would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that

Snape needs to break through — ”

“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell

stands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.

“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.

 

NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN

RIDGEBACK

Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d

thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be

getting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as though

he’d cracked yet.

Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry,

Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door

to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape

was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which

surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever

Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an

encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling

people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.

Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the

Sorcerer’s Stone. She had started drawing up study

schedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and

Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging

them to do the same.

 

“Hermione, the exams are ages away.”

“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages,

that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.”

“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded

her. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already

know it all.”

“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize

we need to pass these exams to get into the second

year? They’re very important, I should have started

studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into

me.”

Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking

along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so

much homework on them that the Easter holidays

weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It

was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting

the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand

movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron

spent most of their free time in the library with her,

trying to get through all their extra work.

“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one

afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking

longingly out of the library window. It was the first

really fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a

clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in

the air of summer coming.

Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand

Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he

heard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doing in the

library?”

 

Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind

his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin

overcoat.

“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their

interest at once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He

looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin’ fer

Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”

“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron

impressively. “And we know what that dog’s guarding,

it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ”

“Shhhh\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if

anyone was listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it,

what’s the matter with yeh?”

“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a

matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding

the Stone apart from Fluffy — ”

“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see

me later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind,

but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’

s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ”

“See you later, then,” said Harry.

Hagrid shuffled off.

“What was he hiding behind his back?” said

Hermione thoughtfully.

“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?”

“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron,

who’d had enough of working. He came back a

minute later with a pile of books in his arms and

slammed them down on the table.

 

“Dragons'.” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff

about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great

Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon

Keeper’s Guide.”

“Hagrid ’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the

first time I ever met him,” said Harry.

“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon

breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention

of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop

Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in

the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons,

it’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got

off wild ones in Romania.”

“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry.

“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh

Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic

has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind

have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted

them, to make them forget.”

“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.

When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s

hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all

the curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?”

before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly

behind them.

It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a

warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate.

Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat

sandwiches, which they refused.

“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?”

 

“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around

the bush. “We were wondering if you could tell us

what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from

Fluffy.”

Hagrid frowned at him.

“O’ course I can’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know

meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I

wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good

reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I

s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how

yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.”

“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us,

but you do know, you know everything that goes on

round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering

voice. Hagrid ’s beard twitched and they could tell he

was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the

guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered

who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him,

apart from you.”

Hagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and

Ron beamed at Hermione.

“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ...

let’s see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some

o’ the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout

— Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” he

ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell —

an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course.

Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor

Snape.”

“Snape?”

 

“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look,

Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter

steal it.”

Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the

same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting

the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the

other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew

everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and

how to get past Fluffy.

“You’re the only one who knows how to get past

Fluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously.

“And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even

one of the teachers?”

“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said

Hagrid proudly.

“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the

others. “Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m

boiling.”

“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him

glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.

“Hagrid — what’s that?”

But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of

the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.

“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard,

“That’s — er ...”

“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching

over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. “It must’ve

cost you a fortune.”

 

“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the

village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards

with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of

it, ter be honest.”

“But what are you going to do with it when it’s

hatched?” said Hermione.

“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling

a large book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the

library — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit —

it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep

the egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on

’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’

brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’

see here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I

got there’s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They’re rare,

them.”

He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione

didn’t.

“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.

But Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily

as he stoked the fire.

So now they had something else to worry about: what

might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was

hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.

“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron

sighed, as evening after evening they struggled

through all the extra homework they were getting.

Hermione had now started making study schedules

for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.

 

Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry

another note from Hagrid. He had written only two

words: It’s hatching.

Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to

the hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.

“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going

to see a dragon hatching?”

“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s

nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone

finds out what he’s doing — ”

“Shut up!” Harry whispered.

Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped

dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t

like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.

Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology

and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to

Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break.

When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of

their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels

at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge

of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed

and excited.

“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside.

The egg was lying on the table. There were deep

cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny

clicking noise was coming from it.

They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched

with bated breath.

 

All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg

split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It

wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a

crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge

compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout

with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging,

orange eyes.

It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.

“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached

out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head. It snapped at

his fingers, showing pointed fangs.

“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid.

“Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian

Ridgebacks grow, exactly?”

Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly

drained from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to

the window.

“What’s the matter?”

“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains

— it’s a kid — he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.”

Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a

distance there was no mistaking him.

Malfoy had seen the dragon.

Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face

during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione

very nervous. They spent most of their free time in

Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.

“Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.”

 

“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.”

They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times

in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its

nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing his gamekeeping

duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy.

There were empty brandy bottles and chicken

feathers all over the floor.

“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking

at the dragon with misty eyes. “He really knows me

now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s Mommy?”

“He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.

“Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and

Norbert’s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy

could go to Dumbledore at any moment.”

Hagrid bit his lip.

“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’

dump him, can’t.”

Harry suddenly turned to Ron.

“Charlie,” he said.

“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?”

“No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania.

Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him.

Charlie can take care of him and then put him back

in the wild!”

“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?”

And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send

an owl to Charlie to ask him.

 

The following week dragged by. Wednesday night

found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the

common room, long after everyone else had gone to

bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight

when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out

of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak.

He had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed

Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.

“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which

was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going

to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that

dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but

the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a

fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off

for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a

lullaby.”

There was a tap on the dark window.

“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll

have Charlie’s answer!”

The three of them put their heads together to read the

note.

Dear Ron,

How are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to

take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy

getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send

him over with some friends of mine who are coming to

visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen

carrying an illegal dragon.

Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at

midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and

take him away while it’s still dark.

 

Send me an answer as soon as possible.

Love,

Charlie

They looked at one another.

“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It

shouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big

enough to cover two of us and Norbert.”

It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that

the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of

Norbert — and Malfoy.

There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten

hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn’t

know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey —

would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon,

though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty

shade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were

poisonous.

Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing

at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in

bed.

“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that

feels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam

Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he

could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept

threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told

her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I

shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s

why he’s doing this.”

Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.

 

“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said

Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the

contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.

“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice.

“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s

letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to

know we’re getting rid of Norbert.”

Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer.

Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made

them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.

“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told

Hermione. “We haven’t got time to send Charlie

another owl, and this could be our only chance to get

rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got

the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about

that.”

They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a

bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who

opened a window to talk to them.

“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky

stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.”

When they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes

filled with tears, although that might have been

because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.

“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’

playin’ — he’s only a baby, after all.”

The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the

windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to

the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly

enough.

 

They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time

came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn’t

been so worried about what they had to do. It was a

very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late

arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because they’d had to wait for

Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall,

where he’d been playing tennis against the wall.

Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.

“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,”

said Hagrid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his

teddy bear in case he gets lonely.”

From inside the crate came ripping noises that

sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his

head torn off.

“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and

Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak

and stepped underneath it themselves. “Mommy will

never forget you!”

How they managed to get the crate back up to the

castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as

they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the

entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up

another staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s

shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier.

“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the

corridor beneath the tallest tower.

Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them

almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were

already invisible, they shrank into the shadows,

staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling

with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.

 

Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair

net, had Malfoy by the ear.

“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from

Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the

night, how dare you — ”

“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s

coming — he’s got a dragon!”

“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies!

Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you,

Malfoy!”

The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower

seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not

until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did

they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe

properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.

“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”

“Don’t,” Harry advised her.

Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert

thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later,

four broomsticks came swooping down out of the

darkness.

Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed

Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so

they could suspend Norbert between them. They all

helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry

and Hermione shook hands with the others and

thanked them very much.

At last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone.

 

They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their

hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was

off them. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention —

what could spoil their happiness?

The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the

stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face

loomed suddenly out of the darkness.

“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.”

They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.

 

THE FORBIDDEN FOREST

Things couldn’t have been worse.

Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s

study on the first floor, where they sat and waited

without saying a word to each other. Hermione was

trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories

chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more

feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were

going to get out of trouble this time. They were

cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to

forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that

Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out

of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of

night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower,

which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add

Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as

well be packing their bags already.

Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been

worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall

appeared, she was leading Neville.

 

“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the

other two. “I was trying to find you to warn you, I

heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he

said you had a drag — ”

Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but

Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more

likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over

the three of them.

“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch

says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one

o’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.”

It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to

answer a teacher’s question. She was staring at her

slippers, as still as a statue.

“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,”

said Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius

to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-

bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed

and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose

you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the

story and believed it, too?”

Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him

without words that this wasn’t true, because Neville

was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering

Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to

try and find them in the dark, to warn them.

“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four

students out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of

such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you

had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought

Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of

you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr.

Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk

 

around school at night, especially these days, it’s very

dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from

Gryffindor.”

“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the

lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.

“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall,

breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.

“Professor — please — ”

“You can’t—”

“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get

back to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed

of Gryffindor students.”

A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in

last place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance

Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as

though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.

How could they ever make up for this?

Harry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville

sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours.

Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort

him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the

dawn. What would happen when the rest of

Gryffindor found out what they’d done?

At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses

that recorded the House points the next day thought

there ’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly

have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday?

And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter,

the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch

matches, had lost them all those points, him and a

couple of other stupid first years.

 

From being one of the most popular and admired

people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most

hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on

him, because everyone had been longing to see

Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry

went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their

voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other

hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and

cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”

Only Ron stood by him.

“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George

have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been

here, and people still like them.”

“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one

go, though, have they?” said Harry miserably.

“Well — no,” Ron admitted.

It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry

swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t

his business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking

around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that

he went to Wood and offered to resign from the

Quidditch team.

“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do?

How are we going to get any points back if we can’t

win at Quidditch?”

But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the

team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if

they had to speak about him, they called him “the

Seeker.”

Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t

have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as

 

well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either.

Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in

class, keeping her head down and working in silence.

Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far

away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off

his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to

themselves, working late into the night, trying to

remember the ingredients in complicated potions,

learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates

of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ...

Then, about a week before the exams were due to

start, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in

anything that didn’t concern him was put to an

unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his

own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering

from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he

heard Quirrell’s voice.

“No — no — not again, please — ”

It sounded as though someone was threatening him.

Harry moved closer.

“All right — all right — ” he heard Quirrell sob.

Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the

classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and

looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out

of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed

him. He waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had

disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was

empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry

was halfway toward it before he remembered what

he’d promised himself about not meddling.

All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s

Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from

 

what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking

with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to

have given in at last.

Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was

testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d

heard.

“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told

him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell — ”

“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.

“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him

without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the

thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a

book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a

giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”

The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s

eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.

“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done

ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown

out for sure.”

“But we’ve got no proof.” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too

scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he

doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and

that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do

you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a

secret we hate him, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it

up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life

depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the

more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think.

And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about

the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”

Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t.

 

“If we just do a bit of poking around — ”

“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking

around.”

He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to

learn the names of its moons.

The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry,

Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They

were all the same:

Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock

tonight.

Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.

Professor M. McGonagall

Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in

the furor over the points they’d lost. He half expected

Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of

studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry,

she felt they deserved what they’d got.

At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron

in the common room and went down to the entrance

hall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so

was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had

gotten a detention, too.

“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading

them outside.

“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule

again, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh

yes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you

ask me. ... It’s just a pity they let the old

punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from

 

the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in

my office, keep ’em well oiled in case they’re ever

needed. ... Right, off we go, and don’t think of running

off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”

They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville

kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment

was going to be. It must be something really horrible,

or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.

The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it

kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry

could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then

they heard a distant shout.

“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”

Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working

with Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must

have showed in his face, because Filch said, “I

suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with

that oaf? Well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest

you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come

out in one piece.”

At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy

stopped dead in his tracks.

“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite

as cool as usual. “We can’t go in there at night —

there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I

heard.”

Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a

choking noise.

“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice

cracking with glee. “Should’ve thought of them

werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?”

 

Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark,

Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow,

and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.

“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour

already. All right, Harry, Hermione?”

“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said

Filch coldly, “they’re here to be punished, after all.”

“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at

Filch. “Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do

that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.”

“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of

them,” he added nastily, and he turned and started

back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the

darkness.

Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.

“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was

pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.

“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said

Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got

ter pay fer it.”

“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I

thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my

father knew I was doing this, he’d — ”

“ — tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid

growled. “Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone?

Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh think

yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back

off ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!”

 

Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but

then dropped his gaze.

“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully,

’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’

I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a

moment.”

He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his

lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding

earth track that disappeared into the thick black

trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked

into the forest.

“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on

the ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood.

There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.

This is the second time in a week. I found one dead

last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor

thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.”

“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us

first?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his

voice.

“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh

if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the

path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties

an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood

all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around

since last night at least.”

“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s

long teeth.

“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid.

“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco,

Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us

finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right?

 

Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s it — an’

if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll

all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”

The forest was black and silent. A little way into it

they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry,

Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy,

Neville, and Fang took the right.

They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground.

Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the

branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the

fallen leaves.

Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.

“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry

asked.

“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch

a unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never

knew one ter be hurt before.”

They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could

hear running water; there must be a stream

somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn

blood here and there along the winding path.

“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’

worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’

then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!”

Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them

off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an

arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready

to fire. The three of them listened. Something was

slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a

cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting

 

up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound

faded away.

“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here

that shouldn’ be.”

“A werewolf?” Harry suggested.

“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn,

neither,” said Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but

careful, now.”

They walked more slowly, ears straining for the

faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead,

something definitely moved.

“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m

armed!”

And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a

horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard,

but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body

with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws

dropped.

“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are

yeh?”

He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.

“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a

deep, sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?”

“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his

crossbow. “There’s summat bad loose in this forest.

This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the

way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan,

you two. He’s a centaur.”

 

“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.

“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And

do you learn much, up at the school?”

“Erm — ”

“A bit,” said Hermione timidly.

“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He

flung back his head and stared at the sky. “Mars is

bright tonight.”

“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad

we’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn

bin hurt — you seen anythin’?”

Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared

unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.

“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said.

“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.”

“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’,

Ronan? Anythin’ unusual?”

“Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while

Hagrid watched him impatiently. “Unusually bright.”

“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit

nearer home,” said Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed

anythin’ strange?”

Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he

said, “The forest hides many secrets.”

A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid

raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur,

 

black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than

Ronan.

“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?”

“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”

“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you

seen anythin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn

bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?”

Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked

skyward.

“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply.

“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of

you do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be

off, then.”

Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing,

staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until

the trees blocked their view.

“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight

answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not

interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”

“Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.

“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves

mostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if

ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind, centaurs ...

they know things ... jus’ don’ let on much.”

“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?”

said Harry.

 

“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask

me, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never

heard anythin’ like it before.”

They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry

kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the

nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very

glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.

They had just passed a bend in the path when

Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm.

“Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!”

“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the

path, I’ll come back for yeh!”

They heard him crashing away through the

undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very

scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the

rustling of leaves around them.

“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?”

whispered Hermione.

“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got

Neville ... it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.”

The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper

than usual. Harry’s seemed to be picking up every

sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going

on? Where were the others?

At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s

return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him.

Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked

up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville

had panicked and sent up the sparks.

 

“Well be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket

you two were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups —

Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go

with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a

whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time

frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.”

So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with

Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an

hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path

became almost impossible to follow because the trees

were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be

getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a

tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing

around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing

ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient

oak.

“Look — ” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop

Malfoy.

Something bright white was gleaming on the ground.

They inched closer.

It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry

had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its

long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where

it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on

the dark leaves.

Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering

sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on

the edge of the clearing quivered. ... Then, out of the

shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the

ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and

Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the

unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the

animals side, and began to drink its blood.

 

“AAAAAAAAAAARGH ! ”

Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did

Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked

right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its

front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry

— he couldn’t move for fear.

Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his

head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half

blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves

behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean

over Harry, charging at the figure.

The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his

knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he

looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was

standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one

looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a

palomino body.

“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to

his feet.

“Yes — thank you — what was that?”

The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue

eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at

Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out,

livid, on Harry’s forehead.

“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get

back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time —

especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker

this way.

“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered

himself on to his front legs so that Harry could

clamber onto his back.

 

There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from

the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came

bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and

sweaty.

“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You

have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are

you a common mule?”

“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the

Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the

better.”

“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane.

“Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set

ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what

is to come in the movements of the planets?”

Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze

thought he was acting for the best,” he said in his

gloomy voice.

Bane kicked his back legs in anger.

“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs

are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not

our business to run around like donkeys after stray

humans in our forest!”

Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger,

so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.

“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at

Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or

have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set

myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane,

yes, with humans alongside me if I must.”

 

And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on

as best he could, they plunged off into the trees,

leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.

Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.

“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that

thing you saved me from, anyway?”

Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his

head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did

not answer Harry’s question. They made their way

through the trees in silence for so long that Harry

thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore.

They were passing through a particularly dense patch

of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.

“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is

used for?”

“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve

only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.”

“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a

unicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to

lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a

crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even

if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price.

You have slain something pure and defenseless to

save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a

cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your

lips.”

Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was

dappled silver in the moonlight.

“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If

you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t

it?”

 

“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay

alive long enough to drink something else —

something that will bring you back to full strength

and power — something that will mean you can never

die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the

school at this very moment?”

“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life!

But I don’t understand who — ”

“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years

to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting

their chance?”

It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly

around Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees,

he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told

him on the night they had met: “Some say he died.

Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough

human left in him to die.”

“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was VoZ — ”

“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”

Hermione was running toward them down the path,

Hagrid puffing along behind her.

“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was

saying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that

clearing back there.”

“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as

Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are

safe now.”

Harry slid off his back.

 

“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets

have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs.

I hope this is one of those times.”

He turned and cantered back into the depths of the

forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.

Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room,

waiting for them to return. He shouted something

about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him

awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-

eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what

had happened in the forest.

Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in

front of the fire. He was still shaking.

“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ... and

Voldemort’s waiting in the forest ... and all this time

we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. ...”

“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified

whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.

Harry wasn’t listening.

“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. ...

Bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering

with what the planets say is going to happen. ... They

must show that Voldemort’s coming back. ... Bane

thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. ... I

suppose that’s written in the stars as well.”

“Will you stop saying the name\” Ron hissed.

“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the

Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will

be able to come and finish me off. ... Well, I suppose

Bane 11 be happy.”

 

Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word

of comfort.

“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one

You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore

around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway,

who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like

fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says

that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”

The sky had turned light before they stopped talking.

They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But

the night’s surprises weren’t over.

When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his

Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them.

There was a note pinned to it:

Just in case.

 

THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR

In years to come, Harry would never quite remember

how he had managed to get through his exams when

he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through

the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and

there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and

well behind the locked door.

It was sweltering hot, especially in the large

classroom where they did their written papers. They

had been given special, new quills for the exams,

which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating

spell.

They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick

called them one by one into his class to see if they

could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk.

Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse

into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the

snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers.

Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their

necks while they tried to remember how to make a

Forgetfulness potion.

 

Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the

stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been

bothering him ever since his trip into the forest.

Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves

because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that

Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except

that it was now worse than ever because there was a

hooded figure dripping blood in it.

Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry

had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have

scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and

Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as

Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them,

but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they

were so busy with their studying they didn’t have

much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else

might be up to.

Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour

of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d

invented self-stirring cauldrons and they’d be free,

free for a whole wonderful week until their exam

results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns

told them to put down their quills and roll up their

parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the

rest.

“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said

Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto

the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the

1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of

Elfric the Eager.”

Hermione always liked to go through their exam

papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill,

so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under

a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were

 

tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was

basking in the warm shallows.

“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching

out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful,

Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly

we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.”

Harry was rubbing his forehead.

“I wish I knew what this means\” he burst out angrily.

“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but

never as often as this.”

“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.

“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning ... it

means danger’s coming. ...”

Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.

“Harry, relax, Hermione ’s right, the Stone’s safe as

long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never

had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy.

He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to

try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch

for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”

Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking

feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do,

something important. When he tried to explain this,

Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last

night and was halfway through my Transfiguration

notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”

Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have

anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl

flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a

note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one

 

who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray

Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to

get past Fluffy . . . never . . . but —

Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.

“Where ’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.

“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had

turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”

“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.

“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry,

scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid

wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a

stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in

his pocket? How many people wander around with

dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they

found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it

before?”

“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry,

sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t

answer.

Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house;

his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was

shelling peas into a large bowl.

“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got

time fer a drink?”

“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.

“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you

something. You know that night you won Norbert?

What did the stranger you were playing cards with

look like?”

 

“Dunno said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his

cloak off.”

He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his

eyebrows.

“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in

the Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the

village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I

never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”

Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.

“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you

mention Hogwarts at all?”

“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried

to remember. “Yeah ... he asked what I did, an’ I told

him I was gamekeeper here. ... He asked a bit about

the sorta creatures I look after ... so I told him ... an’ I

said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon ...

an’ then ... I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept

buyin’ me drinks. ... Let’s see ... yeah, then he said he

had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I

wanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he

didn’ want it ter go ter any old home. ... So I told him,

after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...”

“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?”

Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm.

“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh

meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a

piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’

play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter

sleep — ”

Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.

 

“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I

said it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other

at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall,

which seemed very cold and gloomy after the

grounds.

“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid

told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was

either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it

must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just

hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us

up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s

office?”

They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign

pointing them in the right direction. They had never

been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know

anyone who had been sent to see him.

“Well just have to — ” Harry began, but a voice

suddenly rang across the hall.

“What are you three doing inside?”

It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of

books.

“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said

Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.

“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall

repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to

want to do. “Why?”

Harry swallowed — now what?

 

“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he

hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils

flared.

“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said

coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry

of Magic and flew off for London at once.”

“He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?”

“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter,

he has many demands on his time — ”

“But this is important.”

“Something you have to say is more important than

the Ministry of Magic, Potter?”

“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds,

“Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ”

Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it

wasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out

of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.

“How do you know — ?” she spluttered.

“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that

someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to

talk to Professor Dumbledore.”

She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.

“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she

said finally. “I don’t know how you found out about

the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal

it, it’s too well protected.”

“But Professor — ”

 

“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said

shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen

books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy

the sunshine.”

But they didn’t.

“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor

McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going

through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out

everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore

out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of

Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns

up.”

“But what can we — ”

Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.

Snape was standing there.

“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.

They stared at him.

“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said,

with an odd, twisted smile.

“We were — ” Harry began, without any idea what he

was going to say.

“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging

around like this, people will think you’re up to

something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose

any more points, can it?”

Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape

called them back.

 

“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings

and I will personally make sure you are expelled.

Good day to you.”

He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.

Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.

“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered

urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape

— wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he

leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”

“Why me?”

“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be

waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a

high voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I

think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ’ ”

“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go

and watch out for Snape.

“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,”

Harry told Ron. “Come on.”

But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had

they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest

of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up

again and this time, she lost her temper.

“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a

pack of enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this

nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here

again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor!

Yes, Weasley, from my own House!”

Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry

had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,”

 

when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and

Hermione came in.

“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and

asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for

Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only

just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”

“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.

The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes

were glittering.

“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and

get to the Stone first.”

“You’re mad!” said Ron.

“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall

and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!”

“SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand?

If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming

back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was

trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to

get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a

school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter

anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you

and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House

Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well,

I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for

Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later

than I would have, because I’m never going over to

the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor

tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me!

Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”

He glared at them.

 

“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.

“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just

lucky I got it back.”

“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.

“All — all three of us?”

“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go

alone?”

“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you

think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go

and look through my books, there might be

something useful. ...”

“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”

“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick

told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve

percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out

after that.”

After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in

the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of

the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any

more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been

upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her

notes, hoping to come across one of the

enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry

and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were

thinking about what they were about to do.

Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.

“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan

finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran

upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the

 

cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had

given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on

Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.

He ran back down to the common room.

“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it

covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet

wandering along on its own — ”

“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of

the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair,

clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d

been making another bid for freedom.

“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly

putting the cloak behind his back.

Neville stared at their guilty faces.

“You’re going out again,” he said.

“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t

you go to bed, Neville?”

Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door.

They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape

might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.

“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught

again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.”

“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is

important.”

But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do

something desperate.

 

“I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in

front of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”

“Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and

don’t be an idiot — ”

“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t

think you should be breaking any more rules! And

you were the one who told me to stand up to people!”

“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation.

“Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.”

He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the

toad, who leapt out of sight.

“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his

fists. “I’m ready!”

Harry turned to Hermione.

“Do something,” he said desperately.

Hermione stepped forward.

“Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.”

She raised her wand.

“Petrificus Totalusl” she cried, pointing it at Neville.

Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang

together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he

stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.

Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were

jammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes

were moving, looking at them in horror.

 

“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.

“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably.

“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.”

“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.

“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they

stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.

But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t

feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state,

every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant

breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on

them.

At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs.

Norris skulking near the top.

“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in

Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they

climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her

lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything.

They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the

staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing

halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would

trip.

“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed

toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes.

“Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you

ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”

He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at

them.

“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping

around unseen.”

 

Harry had a sudden idea.

“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody

Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.”

Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught

himself in time and hovered about a foot off the

stairs.

“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said

greasily. “My mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you

— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old

Peevsie his little joke, sir.”

“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay

away from this place tonight.”

“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up

in the air again. “Hope your business goes well,

Baron, I’ll not bother you.”

And he scooted off.

“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.

A few seconds later, they were there, outside the

third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar.

“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s

already got past Fluffy.”

Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress

upon all three of them what was facing them.

Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.

“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said.

“You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.”

“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.

 

“We’re coming,” said Hermione.

Harry pushed the door open.

As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their

ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their

direction, even though it couldn’t see them.

“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.

“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it

there.”

“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said

Harry. “Well, here goes ...”

He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t

really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes

began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the

dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell

to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast

asleep.

“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out

of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They

could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they

approached the giant heads.

“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron,

peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first,

Hermione?”

“No, I don’t!”

“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully

over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the

trapdoor, which swung up and open.

“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.

 

“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing

down, we’ll just have to drop.”

Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to

get his attention and pointed at himself.

“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I

don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to

Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”

Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’

silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the

moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its

deep sleep.

Harry climbed over it and looked down through the

trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.

He lowered himself through the hole until he was

hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at

Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t

follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to

Dumbledore, right?”

“Right,” said Ron.

“See you in a minute, I hope. ...”

And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as

he fell down, down, down and —

FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he

landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around,

his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he

was sitting on some sort of plant.

“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a

postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a

soft landing, you can jump!”

 

Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to

Harry.

“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.

“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here

to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!”

The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark

from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She

landed on Harry’s other side.

“We must be miles under the school,” she said.

“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.

“Lucky\” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”

She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She

had to struggle because the moment she had landed,

the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils

around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs

had already been bound tightly in long creepers

without their noticing.

Hermione had managed to free herself before the

plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in

horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off

them, but the more they strained against it, the

tighter and faster the plant wound around them.

“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what

this is — it’s Devil’s Snare!”

“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a

great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop

the plant from curling around his neck.

 

“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said

Hermione.

“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped,

wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.

“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare ... what did Professor

Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp — ”

“So light a fire!” Harry choked.

“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione

cried, wringing her hands.

“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A

WITCH OR NOT?”

“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her

wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of

the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at

the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it

loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light

and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself

from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.

“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,”

said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat

off his face.

“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his

head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”

“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone

passageway, which was the only way forward.

All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the

gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The

passageway sloped downward, and Harry was

reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the

 

heart, he remembered the dragons said to be

guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a

dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad

enough ...

“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.

Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to

be coming from up ahead.

“Do you think it’s a ghost?”

“I don’t know ... sounds like wings to me.”

“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”

They reached the end of the passageway and saw

before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling

arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-

bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the

room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a

heavy wooden door.

“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?”

said Ron.

“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious,

but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . .

well, there’s no other choice ... I’ll run.”

He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms,

and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel

sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second,

but nothing happened. He reached the door

untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.

The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved

at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when

Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm.

 

“Now what?” said Ron.

“These birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,”

said Hermione.

They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering —

glittering?

“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re

keys\ Winged keys — look carefully. So that must

mean ...” he looked around the chamber while the

other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes —

look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the

door!”

“But there are hundreds of them!”

Ron examined the lock on the door.

“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably

silver, like the handle.”

They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the

air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They

grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted

and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to

catch one.

Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest

Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting

things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving

about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he

noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it

had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the

keyhole.

“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one —

there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the

feathers are all crumpled on one side.”

 

Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was

pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off

his broom.

“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking

his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “Ron, you

come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and

stop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it.

Right, NOW!”

Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key

dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped

toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a

nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone

with one hand. Ron and Hermione ’s cheers echoed

around the high chamber.

They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the

key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock

and turned — it worked. The moment the lock had

clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very

battered now that it had been caught twice.

“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the

door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.

The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see

anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light

suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing

sight.

They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard,

behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than

they were and carved from what looked like black

stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were

the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered

slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.

“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.

 

“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our

way across the room.”

Behind the white pieces they could see another door.

“How?” said Hermione nervously.

“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be

chessmen.”

He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out

to touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang

to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight

turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.

“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?”

The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other

two.

“This needs thinking about. ...” he said. “I suppose

we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces.

Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron

think. Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or

anything, but neither of you are that good at chess —

“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us

what to do.”

“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and

Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.”

“What about you?”

“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.

 

The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because

at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned

their backs on the white pieces and walked off the

board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,

and Hermione took.

“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering

across the board. “Yes ... look ...”

A white pawn had moved forward two squares.

Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved

silently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were

trembling. What if they lost?

“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”

Their first real shock came when their other knight

was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor

and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite

still, facedown.

“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken.

“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go

on.”

Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces

showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp

black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only

just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in

danger. He himself darted around the board, taking

almost as many white pieces as they had lost black

ones.

“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me

think — let me think ...”

The white queen turned her blank face toward him.

 

“Yes ...” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way ... I’ve got

to be taken.”

“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.

“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make

some sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me —

that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”

“But — ”

“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”

“Ron — ”

“Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the

Stone!”

There was no alternative.

“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined.

“Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve

won.”

He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced.

She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone

arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione

screamed but stayed on her square — the white

queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d

been knocked out.

Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.

The white king took off his crown and threw it at

Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and

bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last

desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione

charged through the door and up the next

passageway.

 

“What if he’s — ?”

“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince

himself. “What do you reckon’s next?”

“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare;

Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall

transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that

leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...”

They had reached another door.

“All right?” Harry whispered.

“Go on.”

Harry pushed it open.

A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of

them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes

watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a

troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out

cold with a bloody lump on its head.

“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry

whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its

massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”

He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly

daring to look at what came next — but there was

nothing very frightening in here, just a table with

seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a

line.

“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”

They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a

fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t

ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same

 

instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading

onward. They were trapped.

“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to

the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:

Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,

Two of us will help you, whichever you would find,

One among us seven will let you move ahead,

Another will transport the drinker back instead,

Two among our number hold only nettle wine,

Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.

Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,

To help you in your choice, we give you these clues

four:

First, however slyly the poison tries to hide

You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;

Second, different are those who stand at either end,

But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;

Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,

Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;

Fourth, the second left and the second on the right

Are twins once you taste them, though different at first

sight

 

Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw

that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like

doing.

“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s

logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t

got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.”

“But so will we, won’t we?”

“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need

is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison;

two are wine; one will get us safely through the black

fire, and one will get us back through the purple.”

“But how do we know which to drink?”

“Give me a minute.”

Hermione read the paper several times. Then she

walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to

herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her

hands.

“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us

through the black fire — toward the Stone.”

Harry looked at the tiny bottle.

“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said.

“That’s hardly one swallow.”

They looked at each other.

“Which one will get you back through the purple

flames?”

Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end

of the line.

 

“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and

get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room,

they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy —

go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to

Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold

Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him,

really.”

“But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with him?”

“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry,

pointing at his scar. “I might get lucky again.”

Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at

Harry and threw her arms around him.

“Hermionel”

“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”

“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very

embarrassed, as she let go of him.

“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There

are more important things — friendship and bravery

and — oh Harry — be carefull”

“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is

which, aren’t you?”

“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from

the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.

“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.

“No — but it’s like ice.”

“Quick, go, before it wears off.”

 

“Good luck — take care — ”

“GO!”

Hermione turned and walked straight through the

purple fire.

Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest

bottle. He turned to face the black flames.

“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle

in one gulp.

It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He

put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced

himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but

couldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see

nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other

side, in the last chamber.

There was already someone there — but it wasn’t

Snape. It wasn’t even Voldemort.

 

THE MAN WITH TWO FACES

It was Quirrell.

“You\” gasped Harry.

Quirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all.

“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be

meeting you here, Potter.”

“But I thought — Snape — ”

“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual

quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes,

Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to

have him swooping around like an overgrown bat.

Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-

stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?”

Harry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it

couldn’t.

“But Snape tried to kill me!”

 

“No, no, no. / tried to kill you. Your friend Miss

Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed

to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She

broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds

and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed

it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a

countercurse, trying to save you.”

“Snape was trying to save me?”

“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think

he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying

to make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny, really ... he

needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with

Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought

Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he

did make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of

time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.”

Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin

air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.

“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the

school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d

seen me coming to look at what was guarding the

Stone.”

“ You let the troll in?”

“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must

have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back

there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was

running around looking for it, Snape, who already

suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head

me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to

death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to

bite Snape ’s leg off properly.

 

“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this

interesting mirror.”

It was only then that Harry realized what was

standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.

“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell

murmured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust

Dumbledore to come up with something like this . . .

but he’s in London ... I’ll be far away by the time he

gets back. ...”

All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell

talking and stop him from concentrating on the

mirror.

“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ” he blurted out.

“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to

look at the back. “He was on to me by that time,

trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected me all

along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could,

when I had Lord Voldemort on my side. ...”

Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and

stared hungrily into it.

“I see the Stone ... I’m presenting it to my master ...

but where is it?”

Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but

they didn’t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving

his whole attention to the mirror.

“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”

“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes.

He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you

 

know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted

you dead.”

“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought

Snape was threatening you.

For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across

Quirrell’s face.

“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my

master’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am

weak — ”

“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?”

Harry gasped.

“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I

met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish

young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about

good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong

I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power,

and those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have

served him faithfully, although I have let him down

many times. He has had to be very hard on me.”

Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive

mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from

Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me

. . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on

me. ...”

Quirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering

his trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so

stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken

hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.

Quirrell cursed under his breath.

“I don’t understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror?

Should I break it?”

 

Harry’s mind was racing.

What I want more than anything else in the world at

the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before

Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see

my self finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s

hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing

what I’m up to?

He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass

without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his

ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell

ignored him. He was still talking to himself.

“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help

me, Master!”

And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice

seemed to come from Quirrell himself.

“Use the boy ... Use the boy ...”

Quirrell rounded on Harry.

“Yes — Potter — come here.”

He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding

Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.

“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror

and tell me what you see.”

Harry walked toward him.

I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie

about what I see, that’s all.

Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in

the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s

 

turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the

mirror, and opened them again.

He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first.

But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It

put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-

red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its

pocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy

drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly —

he’d gotten the Stone.

“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”

Harry screwed up his courage.

“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he

invented. “I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.”

Quirrell cursed again.

“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside,

he felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he

make a break for it?

But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice

spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips.

“He lies ... He lies ...”

“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me

the truth! What did you just see?”

The high voice spoke again.

“Let me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...”

“Master, you are not strong enough!”

“I have strength enough ... for this. ...”

 

Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the

spot. He couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, he

watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap

his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away.

Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it.

Then he turned slowly on the spot.

Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a

sound. Where there should have been a back to

Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible

face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with

glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.

“Harry Potter ...” it whispered.

Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs

wouldn’t move.

“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere

shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can

share another’s body . . . but there have always been

those willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ...

Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks

. . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the

forest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be

able to create a body of my own. ... Now ... why don’t

you give me that Stone in your pocket?”

So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into

Harry’s legs. He stumbled backward.

“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your

own life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as

your parents. ... They died begging me for mercy. ...”

“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.

 

Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that

Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now

smiling.

“How touching ...” it hissed. “I always value bravery.

... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your

father first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but

your mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to

protect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you

want her to have died in vain.”

“NEVER!”

Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort

screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harry

felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. At once, a

needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his

head felt as though it was about to split in two; he

yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his

surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head

lessened — he looked around wildly to see where

Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain,

looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his

eyes.

“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again,

and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet,

landing on top of him, both hands around Harry’s

neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with

pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.

“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my

hands!”

And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground

with his knees, let go of his neck and stared,

bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they

looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.

 

“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched

Voldemort.

Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse,

but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed

Quirrell’s face —

“AAAARGH!”

Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and

then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare

skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only

chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in

enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.

Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm,

and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed

and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s

head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only

hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells

of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in

Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”

He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew

all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ...

down ...

Something gold was glinting just above him. The

Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too

heavy.

He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of

glasses. How strange.

He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus

Dumbledore swam into view above him.

“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.

 

Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The

Stone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —

“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the

times,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the

Stone.”

“Then who does? Sir, I — ”

“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me

thrown out.”

Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized

he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed

with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table

piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.

“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said

Dumbledore, beaming. “What happened down in the

dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a

complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school

knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George

Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a

toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse

you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be

very hygienic, and confiscated it.”

“How long have I been in here?”

“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger

will be most relieved you have come round, they have

been extremely worried.”

“But sir, the Stone — ”

“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the

Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it

 

from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although

you were doing very well on your own, I must say.”

“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”

“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I

reached London than it became clear to me that the

place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived

just in time to pull Quirrell off you — ”

“It was you.”

“I feared I might be too late.”

“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the

Stone much longer — ”

“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly

killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid

it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.”

“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend —

Nicolas Flamel — ”

“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore,

sounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing

properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a

little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”

“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”

“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in

order and then, yes, they will die.”

Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on

Harry’s face.

“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible,

but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to

 

bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-

organized mind, death is but the next great

adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a

wonderful thing. As much money and life as you

could want! The two things most human beings would

choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a

knack of choosing precisely those things that are

worst for them.”

Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed

a little and smiled at the ceiling.

“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking ... Sir — even if

the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ”

“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper

name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the

thing itself.”

“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of

coming back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has

he?”

“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there

somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to

share ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He

left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his

followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while

you may only have delayed his return to power, it will

merely take someone else who is prepared to fight

what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is

delayed again, and again, why, he may never return

to power.”

Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made

his head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some

other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me ...

things I want to know the truth about. ...”

 

“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and

terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with

great caution. However, I shall answer your questions

unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case

I beg you 11 forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”

“Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother

because she tried to stop him from killing me. But

why would he want to kill me in the first place?”

Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.

“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you.

Not today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it

from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . .

I know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready,

you will know.”

And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.

“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?”

“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing

Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t

realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you

leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to

have been loved so deeply, even though the person

who loved us is gone, will give us some protection

forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred,

greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,

could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to

touch a person marked by something so good.”

Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out

on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his

eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again,

Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know

who sent it to me?”

 

“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my

possession, and I thought you might like it.”

Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things ... your

father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens

to steal food when he was here.”

“And there’s something else ...”

“Fire away.”

“Quirrell said Snape — ”

“Professor Snape, Harry.”

“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he

hated my father. Is that true?”

“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike

yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did

something Snape could never forgive.”

“What?”

“He saved his life.”

“What?”

“Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way

people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape

couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. ... I do

believe he worked so hard to protect you this year

because he felt that would make him and your father

even. Then he could go back to hating your father’s

memory in peace. ...”

Harry tried to understand this but it made his head

pound, so he stopped.

“And sir, there’s one more thing ...”

 

“Just the one?”

“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”

“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of

my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me,

that’s saying something. You see, only one who

wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it —

would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see

themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My

brain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough

questions. I suggest you make a start on these

sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was

unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a

vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve

rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe

with a nice toffee, don’t you?”

He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his

mouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”

Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but

very strict.

“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded.

“Absolutely not.”

“You let Professor Dumbledore in. ...”

“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite

different. You need rest.”

“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go

on, Madam Pomfrey ...”

“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.”

And she let Ron and Hermione in.

 

“Harryl”

Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him

again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his

head was still very sore.

“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to —

Dumbledore was so worried — ”

“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What

really happened?”

It was one of those rare occasions when the true story

is even more strange and exciting than the wild

rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the

mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione

were a very good audience; they gasped in all the

right places, and when Harry told them what was

under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.

“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just

going to die?”

“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that —

what was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is

but the next great adventure.’ ”

“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron,

looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.

“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.

“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought

Ron round — that took a while — and we were

dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when

we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew —

he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and

hurtled off to the third floor.”

 

“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron.

“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?”

“Well,” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say

— that’s terrible — you could have been killed.”

“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny

man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give

me a chance. I think he knows more or less

everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he

had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and

instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to

help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find

out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought

I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. ...”

“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said

Ron proudly. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-

of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and

Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last

Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by

Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.”

At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.

“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she

said firmly.

•k k k

After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to

normal.

“I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as

she straightened his many candy boxes. “I can, can’t

I?”

 

“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to

go,” she said sniffily, as though in her opinion

Professor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts

could be. “And you have another visitor.”

“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?”

Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual

when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be

allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at

him, and burst into tears.

“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his

face in his hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past

Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn’t

know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a

dragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked

out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!”

“Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking

with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into

his beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow,

this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found

out even if you hadn’t told him.”

“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the

name!”

“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so

shocked, he stopped crying. “I’ve met him and I’m

calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we

saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a

Chocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. ...”

Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and

said, “That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.”

“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry

anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.

 

“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter

fix it. ’Course, he shoulda sacked me instead —

anyway, got y eh this ...”

It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book.

Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard

photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every

page were his mother and father.

“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends,

askin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh

like it?”

Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.

Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast

alone that night. He had been held up by Madam

Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one

last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It

was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and

silver to celebrate Slytherin ’s winning the House Cup

for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing

the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the

High Table.

When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and

then everybody started talking loudly at once. He

slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the

Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that

people were standing up to look at him.

Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The

babble died away.

“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully.

“And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing

waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious

feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads

are all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the

 

whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty

before next year starts. ...

“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs

awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place,

Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in

third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two;

Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and

Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.”

A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the

Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging

his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.

“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore.

“However, recent events must be taken into account.”

The room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded

a little.

“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute

points to dish out. Let me see. Yes ...

“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...”

Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish

with a bad sunburn.

"... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has

seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty

points.”

Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling;

the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be

heard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you

know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s

giant chess set!”

At last there was silence again.

 

“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of

cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House

fifty points.”

Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly

suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up

and down the table were beside themselves — they

were a hundred points up.

“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore.

The room went deadly quiet. "... for pure nerve and

outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty

points.”

The din was deafening. Those who could add up while

yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now

had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly

the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House

Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one

more point.

Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell

silent.

“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore,

smiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up

to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our

friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville

Longbottom.”

Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well

have thought some sort of explosion had taken place,

so loud was the noise that erupted from the

Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up

to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock,

disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He

had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor

before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs

and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more

 

stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind

Curse put on him.

“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of

applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were

celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little

change of decoration.”

He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green

hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold;

the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering

Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking

Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced

smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once

that Snape ’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one

jot. This didn’t worry Harry. It seemed as though life

would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it

ever was at Hogwarts.

It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than

winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out

mountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight.

Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results

were still to come, but come they did. To their great

surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks;

Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first

years. Even Neville scraped through, his good

Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions

one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as

stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he

had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you

couldn’t have everything in life.

And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their

trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking

in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all

students, warning them not to use magic over the

holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us

 

these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to

take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across

the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express;

talking and laughing as the countryside became

greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor

Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off

their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats;

pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at

King’s Cross station.

It took quite a while for them all to get off the

platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket

barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and

threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting

out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.

“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron,

“both of you — I’ll send you an owl.”

“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look

forward to.”

People jostled them as they moved forward toward the

gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them

called:

“Bye, Harry!”

“See you, Potter!”

“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him.

“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry.

He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway

together.

“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!”

 

It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she

wasn’t pointing at Ron.

“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see

“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.”

Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.

“Busy year?” she said.

“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the

sweater, Mrs. Weasley.”

“Oh, it was nothing, dear.”

“Ready, are you?”

It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still

mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry,

carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary

people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley,

looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.

“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley.

“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry

up, boy, we haven’t got all day.” He walked away.

Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and

Hermione.

“See you over the summer, then.”

“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said

Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon,

shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.

 

“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at

the grin that was spreading over his face. “ They don’t

know we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m

going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...”

HARRY

POTTER

/

THE WORST BIRTHDAY

Not for the first time, an argument had broken out

over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr.

Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of

the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew

Harry’s room.

“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If

you can’t control that owl, it’ll have to go!”

Harry tried, yet again, to explain.

“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around

outside. If I could just let her out at night — ”

“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of

fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. “I know

what 11 happen if that owl’s let out.”

He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.

Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned

by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.

 

“I want more bacon.”

“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt

Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. “We

must build you up while we’ve got the chance. ... I

don’t like the sound of that school food. ...”

“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when / was

at Smeltings,” said Uncle Vernon heartily. “Dudley

gets enough, don’t you, son?”

Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over

either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to

Harry.

“Pass the frying pan.”

“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry

irritably.

The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the

family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his

chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs.

Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands

to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins

throbbing in his temples.

“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean

“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle,

spraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’

WORD IN OUR HOUSE?”

“But I — ”

“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared

Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.

 

“I just — ”

“I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION

OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!”

Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale

aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet.

“All right,” said Harry, “all right ...”

Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded

rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the

corners of his small, sharp eyes.

Ever since Harry had come home for the summer

holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a

bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry

Potter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he

was as not normal as it is possible to be.

Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his

first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and

Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have

him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how

Harry felt.

He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a

constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its

secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though

perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail

arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall,

sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory,

visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to

the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially,

Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding

world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and

fourteen players on broomsticks).

 

All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and

top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had

been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle

Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did

the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House

Quidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all

summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went

back to school without any of his homework done?

The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a

drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as

they were concerned, having a wizard in the family

was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had

even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage,

to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the

wizarding world.

Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle

Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous

black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and

bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on

the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant

green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy.

He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a

thin, lightning-shaped scar.

It was this scar that made Harry so particularly

unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only

hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he

had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years

before.

At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow

survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all

time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and

wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died

in Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his

lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood

why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the

instant he had failed to kill Harry.

 

So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s

sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with

the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept

making odd things happen without meaning to,

believing the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar

in the car crash that had killed his parents.

And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to

Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had

taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his

scar were famous . . . but now the school year was

over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the

summer, back to being treated like a dog that had

rolled in something smelly.

The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today

happened to be Harry’s twelfth birthday. Of course,

his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a

real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it

completely ...

At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat

importantly and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a

very important day.”

Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.

“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of

my career,” said Uncle Vernon.

Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought

bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid

dinner party. He’d been talking of nothing else for two

weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to

dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge

order from him (Uncle Vernon’s company made drills).

 

“I think we should run through the schedule one

more time,” said Uncle Vernon. “We should all be in

position at eight o’clock. Petunia, you will be — ?”

“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting

to welcome them graciously to our home.”

“Good, good. And Dudley?”

“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a

foul, simpering smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and

Mrs. Mason?”

“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.

“Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon. Then he

rounded on Harry. “And you?”

“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and

pretending I’m not there,” said Harry tonelessly.

“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. “I will lead them

into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour

them drinks. At eight-fifteen — ”

“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia.

“And, Dudley, you 11 say — ”

“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs.

Mason?” said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an

invisible woman.

“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia.

“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.

“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending

I’m not there,” said Harry dully.

 

“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good

compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?”

“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr.

Mason. ... Do tell me where you bought your dress,

Mrs. Mason. ...”

“Perfect ... Dudley?”

“How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our

hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’ ”

This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry.

Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son,

while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn’t

see him laughing.

“And you, boy?”

Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.

“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending

I’m not there,” he said.

“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully.

“The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s

going to stay that way. When dinner’s over, you take

Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia,

and I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With any

luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the

news at ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation home in

Majorca this time tomorrow.”

Harry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t

think the Dursleys would like him any better in

Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.

“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner

jackets for Dudley and me. And you,” he snarled at

 

Harry. “You stay out of your aunt’s way while she’s

cleaning.”

Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant,

sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on

the garden bench, and sang under his breath:

“Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me ...”

No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the

evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably

into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than

anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing

Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron

Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn’t

seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had

written to him all summer, even though Ron had said

he was going to ask Harry to come and stay.

Countless times, Harry had been on the point of

unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to

Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth

the risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use

magic outside of school. Harry hadn’t told the

Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he

might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped

them from locking him in the cupboard under the

stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first

couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering

nonsense words under his breath and watching

Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs

would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and

Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the

magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its

appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten

his birthday.

What wouldn’t he give now for a message from

Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He’d almost be

 

glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to

be sure it hadn’t all been a dream. ...

Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At

the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face

with none other than Lord Voldemort himself.

Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he

was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to

regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s

clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow

escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking

in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where

Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his

wide, mad eyes —

Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench.

He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge

— and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous

green eyes had appeared among the leaves.

Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated

across the lawn.

“I know what day it is,” sang Dudley, waddling toward

him.

The huge eyes blinked and vanished.

“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot

where they had been.

“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right

up to him.

“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ve finally learned the

days of the week.”

 

“Today’s your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come

you haven’t got any cards? Haven’t you even got

friends at that freak place?”

“Better not let your mum hear you talking about my

school,” said Harry coolly.

Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping

down his fat bottom.

“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said

suspiciously.

“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to

set it on fire,” said Harry.

Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic

on his fat face.

“You c-can’t — Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic

— he said hell chuck you out of the house — and you

haven’t got anywhere else to go — you haven’t got any

friends to take you — ”

“ Jiggery pokeryV ’ said Harry in a fierce voice. “Hocus

pocus — squiggly wiggly — ”

“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet

as he dashed back toward the house. “MUUUUM!

He’s doing you know what!”

Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither

Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt

Petunia knew he hadn’t really done magic, but he still

had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head

with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to

do, with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d

finished.

 

While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice

cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car,

mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and

watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench.

The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his

neck. Harry knew he shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s

bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had

been thinking himself ... maybe he didn’t have any

friends at Hogwarts. ...

Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he

thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower

beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.

It was half past seven in the evening when at last,

exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.

“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!”

Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming

kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding:

a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets.

A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.

“Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped

Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a

lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already

wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.

Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful

supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia

whisked away his plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!”

As he passed the door to the living room, Harry

caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow

ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the

upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle

Vernon’s furious face appeared at the foot of the

stairs.

 

“Remember, boy — one sound — ”

Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped

inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his

bed.

The trouble was, there was already someone sitting

on it.

 

DOBBY’S WARNING

Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close

thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat-

like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis

balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had

been watching him out of the garden hedge that

morning.

As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s

voice from the hall.

“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”

The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low

that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet.

Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an

old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.

“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously.

“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched

voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. “So

 

long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir ... Such an

honor it is. ...”

“Th-thank you,” said Harry, edging along the wall and

sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was

asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, “What are

you?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead

he said, “Who are you?”

“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” said

the creature.

“Oh — really?” said Harry. “Er — I don’t want to be

rude or anything, but — this isn’t a great time for me

to have a house-elf in my bedroom.”

Aunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the

living room. The elf hung his head.

“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry

quickly, “but, er, is there any particular reason you’re

here?”

“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly. “Dobby has come

to tell you, sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders

where to begin. ...”

“Sit down,” said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.

To his horror, the elf burst into tears — very noisy

tears.

“S-sit down).” he wailed. “Never ... never ever ...”

Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.

“I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I didn’t mean to offend you

or anything — ”

 

“Offend Dobby!” choked the elf. “Dobby has never

been asked to sit down by a wizard — like an equal —

Harry, trying to say “Shh!” and look comforting at the

same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where

he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly

doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat

with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of

watery adoration.

“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said

Harry, trying to cheer him up.

Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he

leapt up and started banging his head furiously on

the window, shouting, “Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!”

“Don’t — what are you doing?” Harry hissed,

springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed —

Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud

screech and was beating her wings wildly against the

bars of her cage.

“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who

had gone slightly cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill

of his family, sir. ...”

“Your family?”

“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. ... Dobby is a

house-elf — bound to serve one house and one family

forever. ...”

“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.

Dobby shuddered.

 

“Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself

most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will

have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they

ever knew, sir — ”

“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the

oven door?”

“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to

punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get

on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do

extra punishments. ...”

“But why don’t you leave? Escape?”

“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will

never set Dobby free . . . Dobby will serve the family

until he dies, sir. ...”

Harry stared.

“And I thought I had it bad staying here for another

four weeks,” he said. “This makes the Dursleys sound

almost human. Can’t anyone help you? Can’t I?”

Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken.

Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude.

“Please,” Harry whispered frantically, “please be quiet.

If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you’re

here — ”

“Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . Dobby has

heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness,

Dobby never knew. ...”

Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said,

“Whatever you’ve heard about my greatness is a load

 

of rubbish. I’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts;

that’s Hermione, she — ”

But he stopped quickly, because thinking about

Hermione was painful.

“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby

reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. “Harry Potter

speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-

Named — ”

“Voldemort?” said Harry.

Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and

moaned, “Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the

name!”

“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people

don’t like it. My friend Ron — ”

He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful,

too.

Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as

headlights.

“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry

Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just

weeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped yet again.”

Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with

tears.

“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of

the grubby pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter

is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers

already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter,

to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in

 

the oven door later. . . . Harry Potter must not go back

to Hogwarts.”

There was a silence broken only by the chink of

knives and forks from downstairs and the distant

rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.

“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back

— term starts on September first. It’s all that’s

keeping me going. You don’t know what it’s like here.

I don’t belong here. I belong in your world — at

Hogwarts.”

“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so

hard his ears flapped. “Harry Potter must stay where

he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry

Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal

danger.”

“Why?” said Harry in surprise.

“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most

terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of

Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,” whispered Dobby,

suddenly trembling all over. “Dobby has known it for

months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in

peril. He is too important, sir!”

“What terrible things?” said Harry at once. “Who’s

plotting them?”

Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged

his head frantically against the wall.

“All right!” cried Harry, grabbing the elf’s arm to stop

him. “You can’t tell me. I understand. But why are

you warning me?” A sudden, unpleasant thought

struck him. “Hang on — this hasn’t got anything to

do with Vol — sorry — with You-Know-Who, has it?

 

You could just shake or nod,” he added hastily as

Dobby’s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again.

Slowly, Dobby shook his head.

“Not — not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir — ”

But Dobby’s eyes were wide and he seemed to be

trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was

completely lost.

“He hasn’t got a brother, has he?”

Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.

“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a

chance of making horrible things happen at

Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore,

for one thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t

you?”

Dobby bowed his head.

“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster

Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby

has heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of He-

Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his

strength. But, sir” — Dobby’s voice dropped to an

urgent whisper — “there are powers Dumbledore

doesn’t ... powers no decent wizard ...”

And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off

the bed, seized Harry’s desk lamp, and started

beating himself around the head with earsplitting

yelps.

A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later

Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon

 

coming into the hall, calling, “Dudley must have left

his television on again, the little tyke!”

“Quick! In the closet!” hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby

in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the

bed just as the door handle turned.

“What — the — devil — are — you — doing?” said

Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly

close to Harry’s. “You’ve just ruined the punch line of

my Japanese golfer joke. ... One more sound and

you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy!”

He stomped flat-footed from the room.

Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.

“See what it’s like here?” he said. “See why I’ve got to

go back to Hogwarts? It’s the only place I’ve got —

well, I think I’ve got friends.”

“Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?” said

Dobby slyly.

“I expect they’ve just been — wait a minute,” said

Harry, frowning. “How do you know my friends

haven’t been writing to me?”

Dobby shuffled his feet.

“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. Dobby

did it for the best — ”

“Have you been stopping my letters?”

“Dobby has them here, sir,” said the elf. Stepping

nimbly out of Harry’s reach, he pulled a thick wad of

envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was

wearing. Harry could make out Hermione’s neat

 

writing, Ron’s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that

looked as though it was from the Hogwarts

gamekeeper, Hagrid.

Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.

“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry. ... Dobby hoped ... if

Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him . . .

Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.

Harry wasn’t listening. He made a grab for the letters,

but Dobby jumped out of reach.

“Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his

word that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this

is a danger you must not face! Say you won’t go back,

sir!”

“No,” said Harry angrily. “Give me my friends’ letters!”

“Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,” said the

elf sadly.

Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the

bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the

stairs.

Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him,

trying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six

steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking

around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard

Uncle Vernon saying, "... tell Petunia that very funny

story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason.

She’s been dying to hear ...”

Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his

stomach disappear.

 

Aunt Petunia’s masterpiece of a pudding, the

mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating

up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the

corner crouched Dobby.

“No,” croaked Harry. “Please ... they’ll kill me. ...”

“Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school

“Dobby ... please ...”

“Say it, sir — ”

“I can’t — ”

Dobby gave him a tragic look.

“Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own

good.”

The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping

crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the

dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby

vanished.

There were screams from the dining room and Uncle

Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with

shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia’s

pudding.

At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would

manage to gloss the whole thing over. (“Just our

nephew — very disturbed — meeting strangers upsets

him, so we kept him upstairs. ...”) He shooed the

shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised

Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life

when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop.

Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer

 

and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the

kitchen clean.

Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his

deal — if it hadn’t been for the owl.

Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-

dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through

the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs.

Mason’s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason

screamed like a banshee and ran from the house

shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long

enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally

afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask

whether this was their idea of a joke.

Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for

support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a

demonic glint in his tiny eyes.

“Read it!” he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the

owl had delivered. “Go on — read it!”

Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.

Dear Mr. Potter,

We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was

used at your place of residence this evening at twelve

minutes past nine.

As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to

perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on

your part may lead to expulsion from said school

(Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage

Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).

We would also ask you to remember that any magical

activity that risks notice by members of the non-

P a g e | 24 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling

magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense

under section 13 of the International Confederation of

Warlocks’ Statute of Secrecy.

Enjoy your holidays!

Yours sincerely,

Mafalda Hopkirk

IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE

Ministry of Magic

Harry looked up from the letter and gulped.

“You didn’t tell us you weren’t allowed to use magic

outside school,” said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam

dancing in his eyes. “Forgot to mention it. ... Slipped

your mind, I daresay. ...”

He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog,

all his teeth bared. “Well, I’ve got news for you, boy. ...

I’m locking you up. ... You’re never going back to that

school . . . never . . . and if you try and magic yourself

out — they 11 expel you!”

And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back

upstairs.

Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following

morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry’s window.

He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so

that small amounts of food could be pushed inside

three times a day. They let Harry out to use the

bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was

locked in his room around the clock.

 

Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign

of relenting, and Harry couldn’t see any way out of his

situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking

behind the bars on the window and wondered

miserably what was going to happen to him.

What was the good of magicking himself out of his

room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life

at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that

the Dursleys knew they weren’t going to wake up as

fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might

have saved Harry from horrible happenings at

Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he’d

probably starve to death anyway.

The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia’s hand

appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the

room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger,

jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-

cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he

crossed the room to Hedwig’s cage and tipped the

soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her

empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave

him a look of deep disgust.

“It’s no good turning your beak up at it — that’s all

we’ve got,” said Harry grimly.

He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the

cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even

hungrier than he had been before the soup.

Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks,

what would happen if he didn’t turn up at Hogwarts?

Would someone be sent to see why he hadn’t come

back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let

him go?

 

The room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach

rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable

questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep.

He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card

reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage.

People goggled through the bars at him as he lay,

starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby’s

face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help,

but Dobby called, “Harry Potter is safe there, sir!” and

vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley

rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him.

“Stop it,” Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in

his sore head. “Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I’m

trying to sleep. ...”

He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through

the bars on the window. And someone was goggling

through the bars at him: a freckle-faced, red-haired,

long-nosed someone.

Ron Weasley was outside Harry’s window.

 

3

THE BURROW

“Ron\” breathed Harry, creeping to the window and

pushing it up so they could talk through the bars.

“Ron, how did you — What the — ?”

Harry’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he

was seeing hit him. Ron was leaning out of the back

window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in

midair. Grinning at Harry from the front seats were

Fred and George, Ron’s elder twin brothers.

“All right, Harry?” asked George.

“What’s been going on?” said Ron. “Why haven’t you

been answering my letters? I’ve asked you to stay

about twelve times, and then Dad came home and

said you’d got an official warning for using magic in

front of Muggles — ”

“It wasn’t me — and how did he know?”

“He works for the Ministry,” said Ron. “You know

we’re not supposed to do spells outside school — ”

 

“You should talk,” said Harry, staring at the floating

car.

“Oh, this doesn’t count,” said Ron. “We’re only

borrowing this. It’s Dad’s, we didn’t enchant it. But

doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with — ”

“I told you, I didn’t — but it’ll take too long to explain

now — look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the

Dursleys have locked me up and won’t let me come

back, and obviously I can’t magic myself out, because

the Ministry’ll think that’s the second spell I’ve done

in three days, so — ”

“Stop gibbering,” said Ron. “We’ve come to take you

home with us.”

“But you can’t magic me out either — ”

“We don’t need to,” said Ron, jerking his head toward

the front seat and grinning. “You forget who I’ve got

with me.”

“Tie that around the bars,” said Fred, throwing the

end of a rope to Harry.

“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said Harry as he

tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up

the car.

“Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.”

Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig,

who seemed to have realized how important this was

and kept still and silent. The car revved louder and

louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the

bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred

drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the

window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the

 

ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car.

Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound

from the Dursleys’ bedroom.

When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron,

Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry’s window.

“Get in,” Ron said.

“But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my

broomstick — ”

“Where is it?”

“Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can’t

get out of this room — ”

“No problem,” said George from the front passenger

seat. “Out of the way, Harry.”

Fred and George climbed catlike through the window

into Harry’s room. You had to hand it to them,

thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin

from his pocket and started to pick the lock.

“A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing

this sort of Muggle trick,” said Fred, “but we feel

they’re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit

slow.”

There was a small click and the door swung open.

“So — we’ll get your trunk — you grab anything you

need from your room and hand it out to Ron,”

whispered George.

“Watch out for the bottom stair — it creaks,” Harry

whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the

dark landing.

 

Harry dashed around his room, collecting his things

and passing them out of the window to Ron. Then he

went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the

stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.

At last, panting, they reached the landing, then

carried the trunk through Harry’s room to the open

window. Fred climbed back into the car to pull with

Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom

side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.

Uncle Vernon coughed again.

“A bit more,” panted Fred, who was pulling from

inside the car. “One good push — ”

Harry and George threw their shoulders against the

trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat

of the car.

“Okay, let’s go,” George whispered.

But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came

a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed

immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon’s voice.

“THAT RUDDY OWL!”

“I’ve forgotten Hedwig!”

Harry tore back across the room as the landing light

clicked on — he snatched up Hedwig’s cage, dashed

to the window, and passed it out to Ron. He was

scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when

Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door — and

it crashed open.

 

For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the

doorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull

and dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle.

Ron, Fred, and George seized Harry’s arms and pulled

as hard as they could.

“Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon. “He’s getting away!

HE’S GETTING AWAY!”

But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry’s leg

slid out of Uncle Vernon’s grasp — Harry was in the

car — he’d slammed the door shut —

“Put your foot down, Fred!” yelled Ron, and the car

shot suddenly toward the moon.

Harry couldn’t believe it — he was free. He rolled

down the window, the night air whipping his hair,

and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet

Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were

all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry’s window.

“See you next summer!” Harry yelled.

The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled

back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear.

“Let Hedwig out,” he told Ron. “She can fly behind us.

She hasn’t had a chance to stretch her wings for

ages.”

George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment

later, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to

glide alongside them like a ghost.

“So — what’s the story, Harry?” said Ron impatiently.

“What’s been happening?”

 

Harry told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d

given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding.

There was a long, shocked silence when he had

finished.

“Very fishy,” said Fred finally.

“Definitely dodgy,” agreed George. “So he wouldn’t

even tell you who’s supposed to be plotting all this

stuff?”

“I don’t think he could,” said Harry. “I told you, every

time he got close to letting something slip, he started

banging his head against the wall.”

He saw Fred and George look at each other.

“What, you think he was lying to me?” said Harry.

“Well,” said Fred, “put it this way — house-elves have

got powerful magic of their own, but they can’t

usually use it without their master’s permission. I

reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back

to Hogwarts. Someone’s idea of a joke. Can you think

of anyone at school with a grudge against you?”

“Yes,” said Harry and Ron together, instantly.

“Draco Malfoy,” Harry explained. “He hates me.”

“Draco Malfoy?” said George, turning around. “Not

Lucius Malfoy’s son?”

“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said

Harry. “Why?”

“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He

was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.”

 

“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred,

craning around to look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came

back saying he’d never meant any of it. Load of dung

— Dad reckons he was right in You-Know- Who’s

inner circle.”

Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family

before, and they didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy

made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful,

and sensitive boy.

“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf.

...” said Harry.

“Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding

family, and they’ll be rich,” said Fred.

“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to

do the ironing,” said George. “But all we’ve got is a

lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the

garden. House-elves come with big old manors and

castles and places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in

our house. ...”

Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco

Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family

was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy

strutting around a large manor house. Sending the

family servant to stop Harry from going back to

Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing

Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take

Dobby seriously?

“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron. “I

was getting really worried when you didn’t answer

any of my letters. I thought it was Errol’s fault at first

“Who’s Errol?”

 

“Our owl. He’s ancient. It wouldn’t be the first time

he’d collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow

Hermes — ”

“Who?”

“The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was

made prefect,” said Fred from the front.

“But Percy wouldn’t lend him to me,” said Ron. “Said

he needed him.”

“Percy’s been acting very oddly this summer,” said

George, frowning. “And he has been sending a lot of

letters and spending a load of time shut up in his

room. ... I mean, there’s only so many times you can

polish a prefect badge. ... You’re driving too far west,

Fred,” he added, pointing at a compass on the

dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel.

“So, does your dad know you’ve got the car?” said

Harry, guessing the answer.

“Er, no,” said Ron, “he had to work tonight. Hopefully

we’ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum

noticing we flew it.”

“What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic,

anyway?”

“He works in the most boring department,” said Ron.

“The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.”

“The what?”

“It’s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-

made, you know, in case they end up back in a

Muggle shop or house. Like, last year, some old witch

died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop.

 

This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried

to serve her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare —

Dad was working overtime for weeks.”

“What happened?”

“The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all

over the place and one man ended up in the hospital

with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. Dad was

going frantic — it’s only him and an old warlock

called Perkins in the office — and they had to do

Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up —

“But your dad — this car — ”

Fred laughed. “Yeah, Dad’s crazy about everything to

do with Muggles; our shed’s full of Muggle stuff. He

takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back

together again. If he raided our house he’d have to put

himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.”

“That’s the main road,” said George, peering down

through the windshield. “We’ll be there in ten

minutes. ... Just as well, it’s getting light. ...”

A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to

the east.

Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark

patchwork of fields and clumps of trees.

“We’re a little way outside the village,” said George.

“Ottery St. Catchpole.”

Lower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a

brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees.

 

“Touchdown!” said Fred as, with a slight bump, they

hit the ground. They had landed next to a

tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked

out for the first time at Ron’s house.

It looked as though it had once been a large stone

pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and

there until it was several stories high and so crooked

it looked as though it were held up by magic (which,

Harry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five

chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A

lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance

read, THE BURROW. Around the front door lay a

jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron.

Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way

around the yard.

“It’s not much,” said Ron.

“It’s wonderful,” said Harry happily, thinking of Privet

Drive.

They got out of the car.

“Now, we’ll go upstairs really quietly,” said Fred, “and

wait for Mum to call us for breakfast. Then, Ron, you

come bounding downstairs going, ‘Mum, look who

turned up in the night!’ and she’ll be all pleased to

see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the

car.”

“Right,” said Ron. “Come on, Harry, I sleep at the —

at the top — ”

Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on

the house. The other three wheeled around.

Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard,

scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-

P a g e | 37 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling

faced woman, it was remarkable how much she

looked like a saber-toothed tiger.

“Ah,” said Fred.

“Oh, dear,” said George.

Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her

hands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the

next. She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand

sticking out of the pocket.

“So,” she said.

“ ’Morning, Mum,” said George, in what he clearly

thought was a jaunty, winning voice.

“Have you any idea how worried I’ve been?” said Mrs.

Weasley in a deadly whisper.

“Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to — ”

All three of Mrs. Weasley’s sons were taller than she

was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them.

“Beds empty\ No note\ Car gone — could have crashed

— out of my mind with worry — did you care? —

never, as long as I’ve lived — you wait until your father

gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or

Charlie or Percy — ”

“Perfect Percy,” muttered Fred.

“YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF

PERCY’S BOOK!” yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a

finger in Fred’s chest. “You could havedied, you could

have been seen, you could have lost your father his

job

 

It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had

shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry,

who backed away.

“I’m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,” she said.

“Come in and have some breakfast.”

She turned and walked back into the house and

Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded

encouragingly, followed her.

The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There

was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the

middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat,

looking around. He had never been in a wizard house

before.

The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand

and no numbers at all. Written around the edge were

things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the

chickens, and You’re late. Books were stacked three

deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm

Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One

Minute Feasts — It’s Magid And unless Harry’s ears

were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had

just announced that coming up was “Witching Hour,

with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina

Warbeck.”

Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking

breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at

her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan.

Every now and then she muttered things like “don’t

know what you were thinking of,” and “never would

have believed it.”

“I don’t blame you, dear,” she assured Harry, tipping

eight or nine sausages onto his plate. “Arthur and I

have been worried about you, too. Just last night we

 

were saying we’d come and get you ourselves if you

hadn’t written back to Ron by Friday. But really” (she

was now adding three fried eggs to his plate), “flying

an illegal car halfway across the country — anyone

could have seen you — ”

She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the

sink, which began to clean themselves, clinking

gently in the background.

“It was cloudy, Mum!” said Fred.

“You keep your mouth closed while you’re eating!”

Mrs. Weasley snapped.

“They were starving him, Mum!” said George.

“And you!” said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a

slightly softened expression that she started cutting

Harry bread and buttering it for him.

At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a

small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who

appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran

out again.

“Ginny,” said Ron in an undertone to Harry. “My

sister. She’s been talking about you all summer.”

“Yeah, she’ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,” Fred

said with a grin, but he caught his mother’s eye and

bent his face over his plate without another word.

Nothing more was said until all four plates were

clean, which took a surprisingly short time.

“Blimey, I’m tired,” yawned Fred, setting down his

knife and fork at last. “I think I’ll go to bed and — ”

 

“You will not,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “It’s your own

fault you’ve been up all night. You’re going to de-

gnome the garden for me; they’re getting completely

out of hand again — ”

“Oh, Mum — ”

“And you two,” she said, glaring at Ron and Fred.

“You can go up to bed, dear,” she added to Harry.

“You didn’t ask them to fly that wretched car — ”

But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, “I’ll help

Ron. I’ve never seen a de-gnoming — ”

“That’s very sweet of you, dear, but it’s dull work,”

said Mrs. Weasley. “Now, let’s see what Lockhart’s got

to say on the subject — ”

And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the

mantelpiece. George groaned.

“Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden — ”

Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley’s book.

Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words

Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests. There

was a big photograph on the front of a very good-

looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue

eyes. As always in the wizarding world, the

photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry

supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking

cheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down

at him.

“Oh, he is marvelous,” she said. “He knows his

household pests, all right, it’s a wonderful book. ...”

“Mum fancies him,” said Fred, in a very audible

whisper.

 

“Don’t be so ridiculous, Fred,” said Mrs. Weasley, her

cheeks rather pink. “All right, if you think you know

better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it,

and woe betide you if there’s a single gnome in that

garden when I come out to inspect it.”

Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched

outside with Harry behind them. The garden was

large, and in Harry’s eyes, exactly what a garden

should be. The Dursleys wouldn’t have liked it —

there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed

cutting — but there were gnarled trees all around the

walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every

flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.

“Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,” Harry

told Ron as they crossed the lawn.

“Yeah, I’ve seen those things they think are gnomes,”

said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush,

“like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods. ...”

There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush

shuddered, and Ron straightened up. “ This is a

gnome,” he said grimly.

“Gerroff me! Gerroff me!” squealed the gnome.

It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small

and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head

exactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm’s length as it

kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped

it around the ankles and turned it upside down.

“This is what you have to do,” he said. He raised the

gnome above his head (“Gerroff me!”) and started to

swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the

shocked look on Harry’s face, Ron added, “It doesn’t

 

hurt them — you’ve just got to make them really dizzy

so they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes.”

He let go of the gnome’s ankles: It flew twenty feet

into the air and landed with a thud in the field over

the hedge.

“Pitiful,” said Fred. “I bet I can get mine beyond that

stump.”

Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the

gnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he

caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing

weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry’s

finger and he had a hard job shaking it off — until —

“Wow, Harry — that must’ve been fifty feet. ...”

The air was soon thick with flying gnomes.

“See, they’re not too bright,” said George, seizing five

or six gnomes at once. “The moment they know the

de-gnoming’s going on they storm up to have a look.

You’d think they’d have learned by now just to stay

put.”

Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking

away in a straggling line, their little shoulders

hunched.

“They’ll be back,” said Ron as they watched the

gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of

the field. “They love it here. ... Dad’s too soft with

them; he thinks they’re funny. ...”

Just then, the front door slammed.

“He’s back!” said George. “Dad’s home!”

 

They hurried through the garden and back into the

house.

Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his

glasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man,

going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as

any of his children’s. He was wearing long green

robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.

“What a night,” he mumbled, groping for the teapot as

they all sat down around him. “Nine raids. Nine! And

old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me

when I had my back turned. ...”

Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.

“Find anything, Dad?” said Fred eagerly.

“All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting

kettle,” yawned Mr. Weasley. “There was some pretty

nasty stuff that wasn’t my department, though.

Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some

extremely odd ferrets, but that’s the Committee on

Experimental Charms, thank goodness. ...”

“Why would anyone bother making door keys

shrink?” said George.

“Just Muggle-baiting,” sighed Mr. Weasley. “Sell them

a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can

never find it when they need it. ... Of course, it’s very

hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would

admit their key keeps shrinking — they’ll insist they

just keep losing it. Bless them, they’ll go to any

lengths to ignore magic, even if it’s staring them in

the face. ... But the things our lot have taken to

enchanting, you wouldn’t believe — ”

“LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?”

 

Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like

a sword. Mr. Weasley’s eyes jerked open. He stared

guiltily at his wife.

“C-cars, Molly, dear?”

“Yes, Arthur, cars,” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes

flashing. “Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and

telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it

apart to see how it worked, while really he was

enchanting it to make it fly.”

Mr. Weasley blinked.

“Well, dear, I think you’ll find that he would be quite

within the law to do that, even if — er — he maybe

would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth.

... There’s a loophole in the law, you’ll find. ... As long

as he wasn’t intending to fly the car, the fact that the

car could fly wouldn’t — ”

“Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole

when you wrote that law!” shouted Mrs. Weasley.

“Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that

Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your

information, Harry arrived this morning in the car

you weren’t intending to fly!”

“Harry?” said Mr. Weasley blankly. “Harry who?”

He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.

“Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet

you, Ron’s told us so much about — ”

“ Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back

last nighti” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “What have you got

to say about that, eh?”

 

“Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Did it go

all right? I — I mean,” he faltered as sparks flew from

Mrs. Weasley’s eyes, “that — that was very wrong,

boys — very wrong indeed. ...”

“Let’s leave them to it,” Ron muttered to Harry as

Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. “Come on, I’ll

show you my bedroom.”

They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow

passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its

way, zigzagging up through the house. On the third

landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of

a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it

closed with a snap.

“Ginny,” said Ron. “You don’t know how weird it is for

her to be this shy. She never shuts up normally — ”

They climbed two more flights until they reached a

door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it,

saying RONALD’S ROOM.

Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the

sloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a

furnace: Nearly everything in Ron’s room seemed to

be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls,

even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had

covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper

with posters of the same seven witches and wizards,

all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks,

and waving energetically.

“Your Quidditch team?” said Harry.

“The Chudley Cannons,” said Ron, pointing at the

orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two

giant black C’s and a speeding cannonball. “Ninth in

the league.”

 

Ron’s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a

corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to

feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad

Muggle. Ron’s magic wand was lying on top of a fish

tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his

fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of

sun.

Harry stepped over a pack of Self- Shuffling playing

cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window.

In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes

sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys’

hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was

watching him almost nervously, as though waiting for

his opinion.

“It’s a bit small,” said Ron quickly. “Not like that room

you had with the Muggles. And I’m right underneath

the ghoul in the attic; he’s always banging on the

pipes and groaning. ...”

But Harry, grinning widely, said, “This is the best

house I’ve ever been in.”

Ron’s ears went pink.

 

AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS

Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from

life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything

neat and ordered; the Weasleys’ house burst with the

strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first

time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen

mantelpiece and it shouted, “ Tuck your shirt in,

scruff yV’ The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped

pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet,

and small explosions from Fred and George’s

bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What

Harry found most unusual about life at Ron’s,

however, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking

ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to

like him.

Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and

tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal.

Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the

dinner table so that he could bombard him with

questions about life with Muggles, asking him to

explain how things like plugs and the postal service

worked.

 

“ Fascinating !” he would say as Harry talked him

through using a telephone. “Ingenious, really, how

many ways Muggles have found of getting along

without magic.”

Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about

a week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and

Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs.

Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen

table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally

knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud

clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things

over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under

the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her

face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn’t

noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs.

Weasley offered him.

“Letters from school,” said Mr. Weasley, passing

Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish

parchment, addressed in green ink. “Dumbledore

already knows you’re here, Harry — doesn’t miss a

trick, that man. You two’ve got them, too,” he added,

as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas.

For a few minutes there was silence as they all read

their letters. Harry’s told him to catch the Hogwarts

Express as usual from King’s Cross station on

September first. There was also a list of the new

books he’d need for the coming year.

SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:

The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda

Goshawk

Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart

Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart

 

Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart

Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart

Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart

Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart

Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart

Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at

Harry’s.

“You’ve been told to get all Lockhart’s books, too!” he

said. “The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher

must be a fan — bet it’s a witch.”

At this point, Fred caught his mother’s eye and

quickly busied himself with the marmalade.

“That lot won’t come cheap,” said George, with a

quick look at his parents. “Lockhart’s books are really

expensive. ...”

“Well, we’ll manage,” said Mrs. Weasley, but she

looked worried. “I expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot

of Ginny’s things secondhand.”

“Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?” Harry

asked Ginny.

She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair,

and put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no

one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron’s

elder brother Percy walked in. He was already

dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his

sweater vest.

“Morning, all,” said Percy briskly. “Lovely day.”

 

He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up

again almost immediately, pulling from underneath

him a molting, gray feather duster — at least, that

was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it

was breathing.

“Errol!” said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and

extracting a letter from under its wing. “Finally — he’s

got Hermione’s answer. I wrote to her saying we were

going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.”

He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door

and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped

straight off again so Ron laid him on the draining

board instead, muttering, “Pathetic.” Then he ripped

open Hermione’s letter and read it out loud:

“ ‘Dear Ron, and Harry if you’re there,

“ ‘I hope everything went all right and that Harry is

okay and that you didn’t do anything illegal to get him

out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble,

too. I’ve been really worried and if Harry is all right,

will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it

would be better if you used a different owl, because I

think another delivery might finish your one off

“ ‘I’m very busy with schoolwork, of course’ — How can

she be?” said Ron in horror. “We’re on vacation! —

‘and we’re going to London next Wednesday to buy my

new books. Why don’t we meet in Diagon Alley?

“ ‘Let me know what’s happening as soon as you can.

Love from Hermione.’ ”

“Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your

things then, too,” said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear

the table. “What ’re you all up to today?”

 

Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up

the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It

was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of

the village below, meaning that they could practice

Quidditch there, as long as they didn’t fly too high.

They couldn’t use real Quidditch balls, which would

have been hard to explain if they had escaped and

flown away over the village; instead they threw apples

for one another to catch. They took turns riding

Harry’s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the

best broom; Ron’s old Shooting Star was often

outstripped by passing butterflies.

Five minutes later they were marching up the hill,

broomsticks over their shoulders. They had asked

Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he

was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so

far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.

“Wish I knew what he was up to,” said Fred, frowning.

“He’s not himself. His exam results came the day

before you did; twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated

at all.”

“Ordinary Wizarding Levels,” George explained, seeing

Harry’s puzzled look. “Bill got twelve, too. If we’re not

careful, we’ll have another Head Boy in the family. I

don’t think I could stand the shame.”

Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next

brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry

had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie

was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt

working for the wizard’s bank, Gringotts.

“Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our

school stuff this year,” said George after a while. “Five

sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a

wand and everything. ...”

 

Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in

an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a

small fortune that his parents had left him. Of course,

it was only in the wizarding world that he had money;

you couldn’t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in

Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts

bank account to the Dursleys; he didn’t think their

horror of anything connected with magic would

stretch to a large pile of gold.

Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following

Wednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon

sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs.

Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece

and peered inside.

“We’re running low, Arthur,” she sighed. “We’ll have

to buy some more today. ... Ah well, guests first! After

you, Harry dear!”

And she offered him the flowerpot.

Harry stared at them all watching him.

“W-what am I supposed to do?” he stammered.

“He’s never traveled by Floo powder,” said Ron

suddenly. “Sorry, Harry, I forgot.”

“Never?” said Mr. Weasley. “But how did you get to

Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year?”

“I went on the Underground — ”

“Really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Were there

escapators? How exactly — ”

 

“Not now, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Floo powder’s

a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you’ve never

used it before — ”

“He’ll be all right, Mum,” said Fred. “Harry, watch us

first.”

He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the

flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the

powder into the flames.

With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose

higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted,

“Diagon Alley!” and vanished.

“You must speak clearly, dear,” Mrs. Weasley told

Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot.

“And be sure to get out at the right grate. ...”

“The right what?” said Harry nervously as the fire

roared and whipped George out of sight, too.

“Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose

from, you know, but as long as you’ve spoken clearly

“He’ll be fine, Molly, don’t fuss,” said Mr. Weasley,

helping himself to Floo powder, too.

“But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain

to his aunt and uncle?”

“They wouldn’t mind,” Harry reassured her. “Dudley

would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a

chimney, don’t worry about that — ”

“Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,” said Mrs.

Weasley. “Now, when you get into the fire, say where

you’re going — ”

 

“And keep your elbows tucked in,” Ron advised.

“And your eyes shut,” said Mrs. Weasley. “The soot —

“Don’t fidget,” said Ron. “Or you might well fall out of

the wrong fireplace — ”

“But don’t panic and get out too early; wait until you

see Fred and George.”

Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a

pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the

fire. He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into

the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a

warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately

swallowed a lot of hot ash.

“D-Dia-gon Alley,” he coughed.

It felt as though he were being sucked down a giant

drain. He seemed to be spinning very fast — the

roaring in his ears was deafening — he tried to keep

his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him

feel sick — something hard knocked his elbow and he

tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning — now

it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face —

squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred

stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the

rooms beyond — his bacon sandwiches were

churning inside him — he closed his eyes again

wishing it would stop, and then —

He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the

bridge of his glasses snap.

Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to

his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He

was quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea.

 

All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone

fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard’s

shop — but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a

Hogwarts school list.

A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a

cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring

glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the

walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the

counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from

the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry

could see through the dusty shop window was

definitely not Diagon Alley.

The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still

stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his

way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before

he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on

the other side of the glass — and one of them was the

very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was

lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses:

Draco Malfoy.

Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large

black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled

the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer

through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy

stepped into the shop.

The man who followed could only be Draco’s father.

He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold,

gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily

at the items on display, and rang a bell on the

counter before turning to his son and saying, “Touch

nothing, Draco.”

Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I

thought you were going to buy me a present.”

 

“I said I would buy you a racing broom,” said his

father, drumming his fingers on the counter.

“What’s the good of that if I’m not on the House

team?” said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered.

“Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year.

Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play

for Gryffindor. He’s not even that good, it’s just

because he’s famous ... famous for having a stupid

scar on his forehead. ...”

Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.

"... everyone thinks he’s so smart, wonderful Potter

with his scar and his broomstick — ”

“You have told me this at least a dozen times

already,” said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his

son. “And I would remind you that it is not — prudent

— to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when

most of our kind regard him as the hero who made

the Dark Lord disappear — ah, Mr. Borgin.”

A stooping man had appeared behind the counter,

smoothing his greasy hair back from his face.

“Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” said

Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. “Delighted —

and young Master Malfoy, too — charmed. How may I

be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and

very reasonably priced — ”

“I’m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,” said

Mr. Malfoy.

“Selling?” The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin ’s

face.

 

“You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is

conducting more raids,” said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll

of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it

for Mr. Borgin to read. “I have a few — ah — items at

home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were

to call. ...”

Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and

looked down the list.

“The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir,

surely?”

Mr. Malfoy’s lip curled.

“I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still

commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows

ever more meddlesome. There are rumors about a

new Muggle Protection Act — no doubt that flea-

bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it

Harry felt a hot surge of anger.

“ — and as you see, certain of these poisons might

make it appear — ”

“I understand, sir, of course,” said Mr. Borgin. “Let

me see ...”

“Can I have that?” interrupted Draco, pointing at the

withered hand on its cushion.

“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr. Borgin, abandoning

Mr. Malfoy’s list and scurrying over to Draco. “Insert a

candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend

of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste,

sir.”

 

“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a

plunderer, Borgin,” said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr.

Borgin said quickly, “No offense, sir, no offense meant

“Though if his grades don’t pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy,

more coldly still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for

“It’s not my fault,” retorted Draco. “The teachers all

have favorites, that Hermione Granger — ”

“I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of

no wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped

Mr. Malfoy.

“Ha!” said Harry under his breath, pleased to see

Draco looking both abashed and angry.

“It’s the same all over,” said Mr. Borgin, in his oily

voice. “Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere —

“Not with me,” said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils

flaring.

“No, sir, nor with me, sir,” said Mr. Borgin, with a

deep bow.

“In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,” said

Mr. Malfoy shortly. “I am in something of a hurry,

Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today — ”

They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as

Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place,

examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to

examine a long coil of hangman’s rope and to read,

smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace

 

of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed — Has

Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.

Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front

of him. He walked forward — he stretched out his

hand for the handle —

“Done,” said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. “Come, Draco

Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco

turned away.

“Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. Ill expect you at the

manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.”

The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped

his oily manner.

“Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories

are true, you haven’t sold me half of what’s hidden in

your manor. ...”

Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back

room. Harry waited for a minute in case he came

back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the

cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop

door.

Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared

around. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that

seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the

Dark Arts. The one he’d just left, Borgin and Burkes,

looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty

window display of shrunken heads and, two doors

down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black

spiders. Two shab by-looking wizards were watching

him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each

other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his

 

glasses on straight and hoping against hope he’d be

able to find a way out of here.

An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling

poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn

Alley. This didn’t help, as Harry had never heard of

such a place. He supposed he hadn’t spoken clearly

enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the

Weasleys’ fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what

to do.

“Not lost are you, my dear?” said a voice in his ear,

making him jump.

An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of

what looked horribly like whole human fingernails.

She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry

backed away.

“I’m fine, thanks,” he said. “I’m just — ”

“HARRY! What d’yeh think yer doin’ down there?”

Harry’s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of

fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she

cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts

gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black

eyes flashing over his great bristling beard.

“Hagrid!” Harry croaked in relief. “I was lost — Floo

powder — ”

Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and

pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray

right out of her hands. Her shrieks followed them all

the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright

sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble

building in the distance — Gringotts Bank. Hagrid

had steered him right into Diagon Alley.

 

“Yer a mess!” said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off

Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a

barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary.

“Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno — dodgy

place, Harry — don’ want no one ter see yeh down

there — ”

“I realized that,” said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made

to brush him off again. “I told you, I was lost — what

were you doing down there, anyway?”

“ I was lookin’ fer a Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent,”

growled Hagrid. “They’re ruinin’ the school cabbages.

Yer not on yer own?”

“I’m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,”

Harry explained. “I’ve got to go and find them. ...”

They set off together down the street.

“How come yeh never wrote back ter me?” said Hagrid

as Harry jogged alongside him (he had to take three

steps to every stride of Hagrid ’s enormous boots).

Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys.

“Lousy Muggles,” growled Hagrid. “If I’d’ve known — ”

“Harry! Harry! Over here!”

Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing

at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She

ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying

behind her.

“What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid — Oh,

it’s wonderful to see you two again — Are you coming

into Gringotts, Harry?”

“As soon as I’ve found the Weasleys,” said Harry.

 

“Yeh won’t have long ter wait,” Hagrid said with a

grin.

Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the

crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and

Mr. Weasley.

“Harry,” Mr. Weasley panted. “We hoped you’d only

gone one grate too far. ...” He mopped his glistening

bald patch. “Molly’s frantic — she’s coming now — ”

“Where did you come out?” Ron asked.

“Knockturn Alley,” said Hagrid grimly.

“Excellent.” said Fred and George together.

“We’ve never been allowed in,” said Ron enviously.

“I should ruddy well think not,” growled Hagrid.

Mrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her

handbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginny just

clinging onto the other.

“Oh, Harry — oh, my dear — you could have been

anywhere — ”

Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush

out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid

hadn’t managed to beat away. Mr. Weasley took

Harry’s glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and

returned them, good as new.

“Well, gotta be off,” said Hagrid, who was having his

hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (“Knockturn Alley! If you

hadn’t found him, Hagrid!”). “See yer at Hogwarts!”

And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than

anyone else in the packed street.

 

“Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?” Harry

asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the

Gringotts steps. “Malfoy and his father.”

“Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?” said Mr. Weasley

sharply behind them.

“No, he was selling — ”

“So he’s worried,” said Mr. Weasley with grim

satisfaction. “Oh, I’d love to get Lucius Malfoy for

something. ...”

“You be careful, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply

as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the

door. “That family’s trouble. Don’t go biting off more

than you can chew — ”

“So you don’t think I’m a match for Lucius Malfoy?”

said Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted

almost at once by the sight of Hermione’s parents,

who were standing nervously at the counter that ran

all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione

to introduce them.

“But you’re Mugglesl” said Mr. Weasley delightedly.

“We must have a drink! What’s that you’ve got there?

Oh, you’re changing Muggle money. Molly, look!” He

pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr.

Granger’s hand.

“Meet you back here,” Ron said to Hermione as the

Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground

vaults by another Gringotts goblin.

The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-

driven carts that sped along minature train tracks

through the bank’s underground tunnels. Harry

enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys’

 

vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in

Knock- turn Alley, when it was opened. There was a

very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one

gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners

before sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt

even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to

block the contents from view as he hastily shoved

handfuls of coins into a leather bag.

Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated.

Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill.

Fred and George had spotted their friend from

Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were

going to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was

insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky

Cauldron for a drink.

“Well all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to

buy your schoolbooks,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting off

with Ginny. “And not one step down Knockturn

Alley!” she shouted at the twins’ retreating backs.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the

winding, cobbled street. The bag of gold, silver, and

bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry’s pocket was

clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large

strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they

slurped happily as they wandered up the alley,

examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed

longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the

windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until

Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment

next door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke

Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who

were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet-

Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full

of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old

cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy,

 

deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book

called Prefects Who Gained Power.

“A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers,”

Ron read aloud off the back cover. “That sounds

fascinating. ...”

“Go away,” Percy snapped.

“ ’Course, he’s very ambitious, Percy, he’s got it all

planned out. ... He wants to be Minister of Magic ...”

Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they

left Percy to it.

An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts.

They were by no means the only ones making their

way to the bookshop. As they approached it, they saw

to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the

doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was

proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the

upper windows:

GILDEROY LOCKHART

will be signing copies of his autobiography

MAGICAL ME

today 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.

“We can actually meet him!” Hermione squealed. “I

mean, he’s written almost the whole booklist!”

The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches

around Mrs. Weasley’s age. A harassed-looking wizard

stood at the door, saying, “Calmly, please, ladies. ...

Don’t push, there ... mind the books, now. ...”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long

line wound right to the back of the shop, where

Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They each

 

grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade

2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the

Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.

“Oh, there you are, good,” said Mrs. Weasley. She

sounded breathless and kept patting her hair. “Well

be able to see him in a minute. ...”

Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a

table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all

winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the

crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-

me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his

pointed wizard’s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his

wavy hair.

A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around

taking photographs with a large black camera that

emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding

flash.

“Out of the way, there,” he snarled at Ron, moving

back to get a better shot. “This is for the Daily Prophet

“Big deal,” said Ron, rubbing his foot where the

photographer had stepped on it.

Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw

Ron — and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he

leapt to his feet and positively shouted, “It can’t be

Harry Potter?”

The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart

dived forward, seized Harry’s arm, and pulled him to

the front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry’s face

burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the

photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting

thick smoke over the Weasleys.

 

“Nice big smile, Harry,” said Lockhart, through his

own gleaming teeth. “Together, you and I are worth

the front page.”

When he finally let go of Harry’s hand, Harry could

hardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle back over to

the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his

shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said loudly, waving for

quiet. “What an extraordinary moment this is! The

perfect moment for me to make a little announcement

I’ve been sitting on for some time!

“When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and

Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography

— which I shall be happy to present him now, free of

charge — ” The crowd applauded again. “He had no

idea,” Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake

that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, “that

he would shortly be getting much, much more than

my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in

fact, be getting the real magical me. Yes, ladies and

gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in

announcing that this September, I will be taking up

the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”

The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found

himself being presented with the entire works of

Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their

weight, he managed to make his way out of the

limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was

standing next to her new cauldron.

“You have these,” Harry mumbled to her, tipping the

books into the cauldron. “I’ll buy my own — ”

 

“Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” said a voice

Harry had no trouble recognizing. He straightened up

and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy,

who was wearing his usual sneer.

“Famous Harry Potter,” said Malfoy. “Can’t even go

into a bookshop without making the front page.”

“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny.

It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry.

She was glaring at Malfoy.

“Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend).” drawled

Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione

fought their way over, both clutching stacks of

Lockhart’s books.

“Oh, it’s you,” said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he

were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe.

“Bet you’re surprised to see Harry here, eh?”

“Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop,

Weasley,” retorted Malfoy. “I suppose your parents

will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.”

Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into

the cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but

Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket.

“Ron!” said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred

and George. “What are you doing? It’s too crowded in

here, let’s go outside.”

“Well, well, well — Arthur Weasley.”

It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco’s

shoulder, sneering in just the same way.

“Lucius,” said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.

 

“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr. Malfoy.

“All those raids ... I hope they’re paying you

overtime?”

He reached into Ginny’s cauldron and extracted, from

amid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very

battered copy of A Beginner’s Guide to Transfiguration.

“Obviously not,” Mr. Malfoy said. “Dear me, what’s

the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if

they don’t even pay you well for it?”

Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.

“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the

name of wizard, Malfoy,” he said.

“Clearly,” said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to

Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching

apprehensively. “The company you keep, Weasley ...

and I thought your family could sink no lower — ”

There was a thud of metal as Ginny’s cauldron went

flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy,

knocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of

heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their

heads; there was a yell of, “Get him, Dad!” from Fred

or George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, “No, Arthur,

no!”; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more

shelves over; “Gentlemen, please — please!” cried the

assistant, and then, louder than all —

“Break it up, there, gents, break it up — ”

Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of

books. In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and

Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr.

Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of

Toadstools. He was still holding Ginny’s old

 

Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes

glittering with malice.

“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your

father can give you — ” Pulling himself out of Hagrid’s

grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.

“Yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur,” said Hagrid,

almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he

straightened his robes. “Rotten ter the core, the whole

family, everyone knows that — no Malfoy’s worth

listenin’ ter — bad blood, that’s what it is — come on

now — let’s get outta here.”

The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop

them from leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid’s

waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried

up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and

Mrs. Weasley beside herself with fury.

“A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in

public ... what Gilderoy Lockhart must’ve thought — ”

“He was pleased,” said Fred. “Didn’t you hear him as

we were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the

Daily Prophet if he’d be able to work the fight into his

report — said it was all publicity — ”

But it was a subdued group that headed back to the

fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the

Weasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling

back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said

good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub

for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley

started to ask them how bus stops worked, but

stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley’s face.

 

Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his

pocket before helping himself to Floo powder. It

definitely wasn’t his favorite way to travel.

 

5

THE WHOMPING WILLOW

The end of the summer vacation came too quickly for

Harry’s liking. He was looking forward to getting back

to Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been

the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel

jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and

the sort of welcome he could expect next time he

turned up on Privet Drive.

On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a

sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry’s favorite

things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding.

Fred and George rounded off the evening with a

display of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the kitchen

with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to

wall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a

last mug of hot chocolate and bed.

It took a long while to get started next morning. They

were up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to

have a great deal to do. Mrs. Weasley dashed about in

a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people

kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of

 

toast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke

his neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed

the yard carrying Ginny’s trunk to the car.

Harry couldn’t see how eight people, six large trunks,

two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small

Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of course, without the

special features that Mr. Weasley had added.

“Not a word to Molly,” he whispered to Harry as he

opened the trunk and showed him how it had been

magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily.

When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley

glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred,

George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by

side, and said, “Muggles do know more than we give

them credit for, don’t they?” She and Ginny got into

the front seat, which had been stretched so that it

resembled a park bench. “I mean, you’d never know it

was this roomy from the outside, would you?”

Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled

out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at

the house. He barely had time to wonder when he’d

see it again when they were back — George had

forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes

after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that

Fred could run in for his broomstick. They had

almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked

that she’d left her diary. By the time she had

clambered back into the car, they were running very

late, and tempers were running high.

Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his

wife.

“Molly, dear — ”

 

“No, Arthur — ”

“No one would see — this little button here is an

Invisibility Booster I installed — that’d get us up in

the air — then we fly above the clouds. We’d be there

in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser — ”

“I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight — ”

They reached King’s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr.

Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for

their trunks and they all hurried into the station.

Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous

year. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine

and three-quarters, which wasn’t visible to the

Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through

the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It

didn’t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that

none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.

“Percy first,” said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at

the clock overhead, which showed they had only five

minutes to disappear casually through the barrier.

Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr.

Weasley went next; Fred and George followed.

“I’ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,” Mrs.

Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny’s hand

and setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone.

“Let’s go together, we’ve only got a minute,” Ron said

to Harry.

Harry made sure that Hedwig’s cage was safely

wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley

around to face the barrier. He felt perfectly confident;

this wasn’t nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo

 

powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of

their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the

barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from it, they

broke into a run and —

CRASH.

Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward;

Ron’s trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was

knocked off his feet, and Hedwig’s cage bounced onto

the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking

indignantly; people all around them stared and a

guard nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think

you’re doing?”

“Lost control of the trolley,” Harry gasped, clutching

his ribs as he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who

was causing such a scene that there was a lot of

muttering about cruelty to animals from the

surrounding crowd.

“Why can’t we get through?” Harry hissed to Ron.

“I dunno — ”

Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people

were still watching them.

“We’re going to miss the train,” Ron whispered. “I

don’t understand why the gateway’s sealed itself — ”

Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening

feeling in the pit of his stomach. Ten seconds ... nine

seconds ...

He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was

right against the barrier and pushed with all his

might. The metal remained solid.

 

Three seconds ... two seconds ... one second ...

“It’s gone,” said Ron, sounding stunned. “The train’s

left. What if Mum and Dad can’t get back through to

us? Have you got any Muggle money?”

Harry gave a hollow laugh. “The Dursleys haven’t

given me pocket money for about six years.”

Ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier.

“Can’t hear a thing,” he said tensely. “What’re we

going to do? I don’t know how long it’ll take Mum and

Dad to get back to us.”

They looked around. People were still watching them,

mainly because of Hedwig’s continuing screeches.

“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said

Harry. “We’re attracting too much atten — ”

“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”

“What about it?”

“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”

“But I thought — ”

“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school,

haven’t we? And even underage wizards are allowed to

use magic if it’s a real emergency, section nineteen or

something of the Restriction of Thingy — ”

“But your mum and dad ...” said Harry, pushing

against the barrier again in the vain hope that it

would give way. “How will they get home?”

 

“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They

know how to Apparate! You know, just vanish and

reappear at home! They only bother with Floo powder

and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not

allowed to Apparate yet. ...”

Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to

excitement.

“Can you fly it?”

“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to

face the exit. “C’mon, let’s go. If we hurry we’ll be able

to follow the Hogwarts Express — ”

And they marched off through the crowd of curious

Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side

road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.

Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of

taps from his wand. They heaved their luggage back

in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the

front.

“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the

ignition with another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his

head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along

the main road ahead, but their street was empty.

“Okay,” he said.

Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard.

The car around them vanished — and so did they.

Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear

the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his

glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had

become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the

ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.

 

“Let’s go,” said Ron’s voice from his right.

And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side

fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in

seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and

glittering, below them.

Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry,

and Ron reappeared.

“Uh-oh,” said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster.

“It’s faulty — ”

Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it

flickered back again.

“Hold on!” Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the

accelerator; they shot straight into the low, woolly

clouds and everything turned dull and foggy.

“Now what?” said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of

cloud pressing in on them from all sides.

“We need to see the train to know what direction to go

in,” said Ron.

“Dip back down again — quickly — ”

They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted

around in their seats, squinting at the ground.

“I can see it!” Harry yelled. “Right ahead — there!”

The Hogwarts Express was streaking along below

them like a scarlet snake.

“Due north,” said Ron, checking the compass on the

dashboard. “Okay, we’ll just have to check on it every

half hour or so — hold on — ”

 

And they shot up through the clouds. A minute later,

they burst out into a blaze of sunlight.

It was a different world. The wheels of the car

skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright,

endless blue under the blinding white sun.

“All we’ve got to worry about now are airplanes,” said

Ron.

They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a

long time, they couldn’t stop.

It was as though they had been plunged into a

fabulous dream. This, thought Harry, was surely the

only way to travel — past swirls and turrets of snowy

cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat

pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the

prospect of seeing Fred’s and George’s jealous faces

when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the

sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle.

They made regular checks on the train as they flew

farther and farther north, each dip beneath the

clouds showing them a different view. London was

soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields

that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great

city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages

with tiny toy churches.

Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to

admit that some of the fun was wearing off. The

toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had

nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their

sweaters, but Harry’s T-shirt was sticking to the back

of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the

end of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the

fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking

longingly of the train miles below, where you could

 

buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a

plump witch. Why hadn’t they been able to get onto

platform nine and three-quarters?

“Can’t be much further, can it?” croaked Ron, hours

later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of

cloud, staining it a deep pink. “Ready for another

check on the train?”

It was still right below them, winding its way past a

snowcapped mountain. It was much darker beneath

the canopy of clouds.

Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them

upward again, but as he did so, the engine began to

whine.

Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.

“It’s probably just tired,” said Ron. “It’s never been

this far before. ...”

And they both pretended not to notice the whining

growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily

darker. Stars were blossoming in the blackness.

Harry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the

way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as

though in protest.

“Not far,” said Ron, more to the car than to Harry,

“not far now,” and he patted the dashboard

nervously.

When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while

later, they had to squint through the darkness for a

landmark they knew.

“There!” Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig

jump. “Straight ahead!”

 

Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over

the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of

Hogwarts castle.

But the car had begun to shudder and was losing

speed.

“Come on,” Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering

wheel a little shake, “nearly there, come on — ”

The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were

issuing from under the hood. Harry found himself

gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew

toward the lake.

The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his

window, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy surface

of the water, a mile below. Ron’s knuckles were white

on the steering wheel. The car wobbled again.

“Come on,” Ron muttered.

They were over the lake — the castle was right ahead

— Ron put his foot down.

There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine

died completely.

“Uh-oh,” said Ron, into the silence.

The nose of the car dropped. They were falling,

gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle

wall.

“IVoooooo!” Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel

around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as

the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark

greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out

over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.

 

Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled

his wand out of his back pocket —

“STOP! STOP!” he yelled, whacking the dashboard

and the windshield, but they were still plummeting,

the ground flying up toward them —

“WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!” Harry bellowed,

lunging for the steering wheel, but too late —

CRUNCH.

With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit

the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a

heavy jolt. Steam was billowing from under the

crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a

golf-ball-sized lump was throbbing on Harry’s head

where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron

let out a low, despairing groan.

“Are you okay?” Harry said urgently.

“My wand,” said Ron, in a shaky voice. “Look at my

wand — ”

It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling

limply, held on by a few splinters.

Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they’d be

able to mend it up at the school, but he never even

got started. At that very moment, something hit his

side of the car with the force of a charging bull,

sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an

equally heavy blow hit the roof.

“What’s happen — ?”

Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and

Harry looked around just in time to see a branch as

 

thick as a python smash into it. The tree they had hit

was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost

double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every

inch of the car it could reach.

“Aaargh!” said Ron as another twisted limb punched a

large dent into his door; the windshield was now

trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like

twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was

pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be

caving —

“Run for it!” Ron shouted, throwing his full weight

against his door, but next second he had been

knocked backward into Harry’s lap by a vicious

uppercut from another branch.

“We’re done for!” he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but

suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating — the

engine had restarted.

“Reverse!” Harry yelled, and the car shot backward;

the tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear

its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing

out at them as they sped out of reach.

“That,” panted Ron, “was close. Well done, car — ”

The car, however, had reached the end of its tether.

With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry

felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was

sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told him

that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk;

Hedwig’s cage flew through the air and burst open;

she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off

toward the castle without a backward look. Then,

dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off

into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.

 

“Come back!” Ron yelled after it, brandishing his

broken wand. “Dad’ll kill me!”

But the car disappeared from view with one last snort

from its exhaust.

“Can you believe our luck?” said Ron miserably,

bending down to pick up Scabbers. “Of all the trees

we could’ve hit, we had to get one that hits back.”

He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree,

which was still flailing its branches threateningly.

“Come on,” said Harry wearily, “we’d better get up to

the school. ...”

It wasn’t at all the triumphant arrival they had

pictured. Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends

of their trunks and began dragging them up the

grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.

“I think the feast’s already started,” said Ron,

dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and

crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window.

“Hey — Harry — come and look — it’s the Sorting!”

Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered

in at the Great Hall.

Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over

four long, crowded tables, making the golden plates

and goblets sparkle. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling,

which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with

stars.

Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats,

Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years

filing into the Hall. Ginny was among them, easily

visible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile,

 

Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her

hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts

Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers.

Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and

dirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts

houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and

Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on,

exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its

decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a few

horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going

to put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned

out more Dark witches and wizards than any other —

but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron,

Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term,

Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House

Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in

seven years.

A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called

forward to place the hat on his head. Harry’s eyes

wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore,

the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the

staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon

glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several

seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in

robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was

Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his

goblet.

“Hang on ...” Harry muttered to Ron. “There’s an

empty chair at the staff table. ... Where’s Snape?”

Professor Severus Snape was Harry’s least favorite

teacher. Harry also happened to be Snape ’s least

favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by

everybody except the students from his own House

(Slytherin), Snape taught Potions.

 

“Maybe he’s ill!” said Ron hopefully.

“Maybe he’s left,” said Harry, “because he missed out

on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again).”

“Or he might have been sacked).” said Ron

enthusiastically. “I mean, everyone hates him — ”

“Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them,

“he’s waiting to hear why you two didn’t arrive on the

school train.”

Harry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in

a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin

man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy,

shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he

was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were

in very deep trouble.

“Follow me,” said Snape.

Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron

followed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing

entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. A

delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great

Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and

light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the

dungeons.

“In!” he said, opening a door halfway down the cold

passageway and pointing.

They entered Snape’s office, shivering. The shadowy

walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in

which floated all manner of revolting things Harry

didn’t really want to know the name of at the

moment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape

closed the door and turned to look at them.

 

“So,” he said softly, “the train isn’t good enough for

the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick,

Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?”

“No, sir, it was the barrier at King’s Cross, it — ”

“Silence!” said Snape coldly. “What have you done

with the car?”

Ron gulped. This wasn’t the first time Snape had

given Harry the impression of being able to read

minds. But a moment later, he understood, as Snape

unrolled today’s issue of the Evening Prophet

“You were seen,” he hissed, showing them the

headline: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES

MUGGLES. He began to read aloud: “Two Muggles in

London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the

Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty

Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus

Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven

Muggles in all. I believe your father works in the

Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?” he said, looking

up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. “Dear, dear

... his own son ...”

Harry felt as though he’d just been walloped in the

stomach by one of the mad tree’s larger branches. If

anyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car

...he hadn’t thought of that. ...

“I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable

damage seems to have been done to a very valuable

Whomping Willow,” Snape went on.

“That tree did more damage to us than we — ” Ron

blurted out.

 

“Silence!” snapped Snape again. “Most unfortunately,

you are not in my House and the decision to expel

you does not rest with me. I shall go and fetch the

people who do have that happy power. You will wait

here.”

Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced.

Harry didn’t feel hungry anymore. He now felt

extremely sick. He tried not to look at a large, slimy

something suspended in green liquid on a shelf

behind Snape ’s desk. If Snape had gone to fetch

Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they

were hardly any better off. She might be fairer than

Snape, but she was still extremely strict.

Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough

it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him.

Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on

several occasions, but either he had forgotten just

how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen

her this angry before. She raised her wand the

moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched,

but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace,

where flames suddenly erupted.

“Sit,” she said, and they both backed into chairs by

the fire.

“Explain,” she said, her glasses glinting ominously.

Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier

at the station refusing to let them through.

“ — so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn’t get on

the train.”

“Why didn’t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you

have an owl?” Professor McGonagall said coldly to

Harry.

 

Harry gaped at her. Now she’d said it, that seemed

the obvious thing to have done.

“I — I didn’t think — ”

“That,” said Professor McGonagall, “is obvious.”

There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now

looking happier than ever, opened it. There stood the

headmaster, Professor Dumbledore.

Harry’s whole body went numb. Dumbledore was

looking unusually grave. He stared down his very

crooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly found

himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up

by the Whomping Willow.

There was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said,

“Please explain why you did this.”

It would have been better if he had shouted. Harry

hated the disappointment in his voice. For some

reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the

eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told

Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley

owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though

he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked

outside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see

through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no

questions about the car. When Harry had finished, he

merely continued to peer at them through his

spectacles.

“Well go and get our stuff,” said Ron in a hopeless

sort of voice.

“What are you talking about, Weasley?” barked

Professor McGonagall.

 

“Well, you’re expelling us, aren’t you?” said Ron.

Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore.

“Not today, Mr. Weasley,” said Dumbledore. “But I

must impress upon both of you the seriousness of

what you have done. I will be writing to both your

families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do

anything like this again, I will have no choice but to

expel you.”

Snape looked as though Christmas had been

canceled. He cleared his throat and said, “Professor

Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for

the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious

damage to an old and valuable tree — surely acts of

this nature — ”

“It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these

boys’ punishments, Severus,” said Dumbledore

calmly. “They are in her House and are therefore her

responsibility.” He turned to Professor McGonagall. “I

must go back to the feast, Minerva, I’ve got to give out

a few notices. Come, Severus, there’s a delicious-

looking custard tart I want to sample — ”

Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as

he allowed himself to be swept out of his office,

leaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who

was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.

“You’d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley,

you’re bleeding.”

“Not much,” said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his

eye with his sleeve. “Professor, I wanted to watch my

sister being Sorted — ”

 

“The Sorting Ceremony is over,” said Professor

McGonagall. “Your sister is also in Gryffindor.”

“Oh, good,” said Ron.

“And speaking of Gryffindor — ” Professor McGonagall

said sharply, but Harry cut in: “Professor, when we

took the car, term hadn’t started, so — so Gryffindor

shouldn’t really have points taken from it — should

it?” he finished, watching her anxiously.

Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but

he was sure she had almost smiled. Her mouth

looked less thin, anyway.

“I will not take any points from Gryffindor,” she said,

and Harry’s heart lightened considerably. “But you

will both get a detention.”

It was better than Harry had expected. As for

Dumbledore’s writing to the Dursleys, that was

nothing. Harry knew perfectly well they’d just be

disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn’t

squashed him flat.

Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and

pointed it at Snape’s desk. A large plate of

sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced

pumpkin juice appeared with a pop.

“You will eat in here and then go straight up to your

dormitory,” she said. “I must also return to the feast.”

When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a

long, low whistle.

“I thought we’d had it,” he said, grabbing a sandwich.

“So did I,” said Harry, taking one, too.

 

“Can you believe our luck, though?” said Ron thickly

through a mouthful of chicken and ham. “Fred and

George must’ve flown that car five or six times and no

Muggle ever saw them.” He swallowed and took

another huge bite. “Why couldn’t we get through the

barrier?”

Harry shrugged. “We’ll have to watch our step from

now on, though,” he said, taking a grateful swig of

pumpkin juice. “Wish we could’ve gone up to the

feast. ...”

“She didn’t want us showing off,” said Ron sagely.

“Doesn’t want people to think it’s clever, arriving by

flying car.”

When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they

could (the plate kept refilling itself), they rose and left

the office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor

Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast

was over. They walked past muttering portraits and

creaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of

stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage

where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was

hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in

a pink silk dress.

“Password?” she said as they approached.

“Er — ” said Harry.

They didn’t know the new year’s password, not having

met a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost

immediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them

and turned to see Hermione dashing toward them.

“There you are! Where have you been? The most

ridiculous rumors — someone said you’d been

expelled for crashing a flying car — ”

 

“Well, we haven’t been expelled,” Harry assured her.

“You’re not telling me you did fly here?” said

Hermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor

McGonagall.

“Skip the lecture,” said Ron impatiently, “and tell us

the new password.”

“It’s ‘wattlebird,’ ” said Hermione impatiently, “but

that’s not the point — ”

Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of

the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden

storm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of

Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the

circular common room, standing on the lopsided

tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to

arrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull

Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble

in after them.

“Brilliant!” yelled Lee Jordan. “Inspired! What an

entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping

Willow, people’ll be talking about that one for years —

“Good for you,” said a fifth year Harry had never

spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as

though he’d just won a marathon; Fred and George

pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said

together, “Why couldn’t we’ve come in the car, eh?”

Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly,

but Harry could see one person who didn’t look happy

at all. Percy was visible over the heads of some

excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get

near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged

Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy’s direction. Ron

got the point at once.

 

“Got to get upstairs — bit tired,” he said, and the two

of them started pushing their way toward the door on

the other side of the room, which led to a spiral

staircase and the dormitories.

“ ’Night,” Harry called back to Hermione, who was

wearing a scowl just like Percy’s.

They managed to get to the other side of the common

room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the

peace of the staircase. They hurried up it, right to the

top, and at last reached the door of their old

dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying

SECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular

room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet

and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been

brought up for them and stood at the ends of their

beds.

Ron grinned guiltily at Harry.

“I know I shouldn’t ’ve enjoyed that or anything, but —

The dormitory door flew open and in came the other

second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean

Thomas, and Neville Longbottom.

“Unbelievablel” beamed Seamus.

“Cool,” said Dean.

“Amazing,” said Neville, awestruck.

Harry couldn’t help it. He grinned, too.

 

6

GILDEROY LOCKHART

The next day, however, Harry barely grinned once.

Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the

Great Hall. The four long House tables were laden

with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains

of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the

enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry

and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to

Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with

Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was

a slight stiffness in the way she said “ ’Morning,”

which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the

way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the

other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a

round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst

memory of anyone Harry had ever met.

“Mail’s due any minute — I think Gran’s sending a

few things I forgot.”

Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure

enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a

hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and

 

dropping letters and packages into the chattering

crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville’s

head and, a second later, something large and gray

fell into Hermione’s jug, spraying them all with milk

and feathers.

“Errol\” said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by

the feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table,

his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his

beak.

“Oh, no — ” Ron gasped.

“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said Hermione, prodding

Errol gently with the tip of her finger.

“It’s not that — it’s that.”

Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite

ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both

looking at it as though they expected it to explode.

“What’s the matter?” said Harry.

“She’s — she’s sent me a Howler,” said Ron faintly.

“You’d better open it, Ron,” said Neville in a timid

whisper. “It’ll be worse if you don’t. My gran sent me

one once, and I ignored it and” — he gulped — “it was

horrible.”

Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red

envelope.

“What’s a Howler?” he said.

But Ron’s whole attention was fixed on the letter,

which had begun to smoke at the corners.

 

“Open it,” Neville urged. “It’ll all be over in a few

minutes — ”

Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope

from Errol’s beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his

fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew

why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar

of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the

ceiling.

“— STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN

SURPRISED IF THEY’D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT

TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON’T SUPPOSE YOU

STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I

WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE — ”

Mrs. Weasley’s yells, a hundred times louder than

usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table,

and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People

throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who

had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his

chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen.

“— LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I

THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME,

WE DIDN’T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS,

YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED — ”

Harry had been wondering when his name was going

to crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he

couldn’t hear the voice that was making his eardrums

throb.

“— ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED — YOUR FATHER’S

FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR

FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE

WE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.”

 

A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had

dropped from Ron’s hand, burst into flames and

curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as

though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few

people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke

out again.

Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked

down at the top of Ron’s head.

“Well, I don’t know what you expected, Ron, but you

“Don’t tell me I deserved it,” snapped Ron.

Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were

burning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry

at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for

him over the summer . . .

But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor

McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table,

handing out course schedules. Harry took his and

saw that they had double Herbology with the

Hufflepuffs first.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together,

crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the

greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At

least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione

seemed to think they had now been punished enough

and was being perfectly friendly again.

As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of

the class standing outside, waiting for Professor

Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just

joined them when she came striding into view across

the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart.

Professor Sprout’s arms were full of bandages, and

 

with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the

Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its

branches now in slings.

Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a

patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually

a large amount of earth on her clothes and her

fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint.

Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in

sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining

under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold

trimming.

“Oh, hello there!” he called, beaming around at the

assembled students. “Just been showing Professor

Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow!

But I don’t want you running away with the idea that

I’m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to

have met several of these exotic plants on my travels

??

“Greenhouse three today, chaps!” said Professor

Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at

all her usual cheerful self.

There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever

worked in greenhouse one before — greenhouse three

housed far more interesting and dangerous plants.

Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and

unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp

earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume

of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from

the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione

inside when Lockhart’s hand shot out.

“Harry! I’ve been wanting a word — you don’t mind if

he’s a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor

Sprout?”

 

Judging by Professor Sprout’s scowl, she did mind,

but Lockhart said, “That’s the ticket,” and closed the

greenhouse door in her face.

“Harry,” said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming

in the sunlight as he shook his head. “Harry, Harry,

Harry.”

Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.

“When I heard — well, of course, it was all my fault.

Could have kicked myself.”

Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was

about to say so when Lockhart went on, “Don’t know

when I’ve been more shocked. Flying a car to

Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you’d

done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.”

It was remarkable how he could show every one of

those brilliant teeth even when he wasn’t talking.

“Gave you a taste for publicity, didn’t I?” said

Lockhart. “Gave you the bug. You got onto the front

page of the paper with me and you couldn’t wait to do

it again.”

“Oh, no, Professor, see — ”

“Harry, Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, reaching out

and grasping his shoulder. “I understand. Natural to

want a bit more once you’ve had that first taste —

and I blame myself for giving you that, because it was

bound to go to your head — but see here, young man,

you can’t start flying cars to try and get yourself

noticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for

all that when you’re older. Yes, yes, I know what

you’re thinking! ‘It’s all right for him, he’s an

internationally famous wizard already! ’ But when I

 

was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are

now. In fact, I’d say I was even more of a nobody! I

mean, a few people have heard of you, haven’t they?

All that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!”

He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead.

“I know, I know — it’s not quite as good as winning

Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award five

times in a row, as I have — but it’s a start, Harry, it’s

a start”

He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry

stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering

he was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened

the door and slid inside.

Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench

in the center of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of

different-colored ear-muffs were lying on the bench.

When Harry had taken his place between Ron and

Hermione, she said, “We’ll be repotting Mandrakes

today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the

Mandrake?”

To nobody’s surprise, Hermione’s hand was first into

the air.

“Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,”

said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had

swallowed the textbook. “It is used to return people

who have been transfigured or cursed to their original

state.”

“Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,” said Professor

Sprout. “The Mandrake forms an essential part of

most antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who

can tell me why?”

Hermione’s hand narrowly missed Harry’s glasses as

it shot up again.

 

“The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears

it,” she said promptly.

“Precisely. Take another ten points,” said Professor

Sprout. “Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still

very young.”

She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and

everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred

or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were

growing there in rows. They looked quite

unremarkable to Harry, who didn’t have the slightest

idea what Hermione meant by the “cry” of the

Mandrake.

“Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,” said Professor

Sprout.

There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair

that wasn’t pink and fluffy.

“When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears

are completely covered,” said Professor Sprout. “When

it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-

up. Right — earmuffs on.”

Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut

out sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink,

fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of

her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and

pulled hard.

Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could

hear.

Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly

baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were

growing right out of his head. He had pale green,

 

mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his

lungs.

Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under

the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying

him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted

leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her

hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed

her own earmuffs.

“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries

won’t kill yet,” she said calmly as though she’d just

done nothing more exciting than water a begonia.

“However, they will knock you out for several hours,

and as I’m sure none of you want to miss your first

day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in

place while you work. I will attract your attention

when it is time to pack up.

“Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here

— compost in the sacks over there — and be careful

of the Venomous Tentacula, it’s teething.”

She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as

she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had

been inching sneakily over her shoulder.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by

a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but

had never spoken to.

“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he said brightly, shaking

Harry by the hand. “Know who you are, of course, the

famous Harry Potter. ... And you’re Hermione Granger

— always top in everything” (Hermione beamed as she

had her hand shaken too) “ — and Ron Weasley.

Wasn’t that your flying car?”

 

Ron didn’t smile. The Howler was obviously still on

his mind.

“That Lockhart’s something, isn’t he?” said Justin

happily as they began filling their plant pots with

dragon dung compost. “Awfully brave chap. Have you

read his books? I’d have died of fear if I’d been

cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he

stayed cool and — zap — just fantastic.

“My name was down for Eton, you know. I can’t tell

you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course,

Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made

her read Lockhart’s books I think she’s begun to see

how useful it’ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the

family. ...”

After that they didn’t have much chance to talk. Their

earmuffs were back on and they needed to

concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had

made it look extremely easy, but it wasn’t. The

Mandrakes didn’t like coming out of the earth, but

didn’t seem to want to go back into it either. They

squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and

gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes

trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.

By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was

sweaty, aching, and covered in earth. Everyone

traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then

the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.

Professor McGonagall’s classes were always hard

work, but today was especially difficult. Everything

Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked

out of his head during the summer. He was supposed

to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he

managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as

it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.

 

Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched

up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it

seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept

crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every

time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed

him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs.

Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally

squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for

a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn’t pleased.

Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain

felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the

classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking

his wand furiously on the desk.

“Stupid — useless — thing — ”

“Write home for another one,” Harry suggested as the

wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker.

“Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,” said Ron,

stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag. “ ‘It’s your

own fault your wand got snapped — ’ ”

They went down to lunch, where Ron’s mood was not

improved by Hermione’s showing them the handful of

perfect coat buttons she had produced in

T ransfiguration .

“What’ve we got this afternoon?” said Harry, hastily

changing the subject.

“Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said Hermione at

once.

“Why,” demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, “have

you outlined all Lockhart’s lessons in little hearts?”

 

Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing

furiously.

They finished lunch and went outside into the

overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone

step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires

again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch

for several minutes before Harry became aware that

he was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the

very small, mousy-haired boy he’d seen trying on the

Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though

transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an

ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry

looked at him, he went bright red.

“All right, Harry? I’m — I’m Colin Creevey,” he said

breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. “I’m in

Gryffindor, too. D’you think — would it be all right if

— can I have a picture?” he said, raising the camera

hopefully.

“A picture?” Harry repeated blankly.

“So I can prove I’ve met you,” said Colin Creevey

eagerly, edging further forward. “I know all about you.

Everyone’s told me. About how you survived when

You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he

disappeared and everything and how you’ve still got a

lightning scar on your forehead” (his eyes raked

Harry’s hairline) “and a boy in my dormitory said if I

develop the film in the right potion, the pictures’ll

move.” Colin drew a great shuddering breath of

excitement and said, “It’s amazing here, isn’t it? I

never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I

got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad’s a milkman, he

couldn’t believe it either. So I’m taking loads of

pictures to send home to him. And it’d be really good

if I had one of you” — he looked imploringly at Harry

 

— “maybe your friend could take it and I could stand

next to you? And then, could you sign it?”

“ Signed photos? You’re giving out signed photos,

Potter?”

Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy’s voice echoed

around the courtyard. He had stopped right behind

Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his

large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.

“Everyone line up!” Malfoy roared to the crowd. “Harry

Potter’s giving out signed photos!”

“No, I’m not,” said Harry angrily, his fists clenching.

“Shut up, Malfoy.”

“You’re just jealous,” piped up Colin, whose entire

body was about as thick as Crabbe ’s neck.

“Jealous?” said Malfoy, who didn’t need to shout

anymore: Half the courtyard was listening in. “Of

what? I don’t want a foul scar right across my head,

thanks. I don’t think getting your head cut open

makes you that special, myself.”

Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.

“Eat slugs, Malfoy,” said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped

laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a

menacing way.

“Be careful, Weasley,” sneered Malfoy. “You don’t

want to start any trouble or your mommy’ll have to

come and take you away from school.” He put on a

shrill, piercing voice. “If you put another toe out of line

 

A knot of Slytherin fifth years nearby laughed loudly

at this.

“Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,” smirked

Malfoy. “It’d be worth more than his family’s whole

house — ”

Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione

shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and

whispered, “Look out!”

“What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart

was striding toward them, his turquoise robes

swirling behind him. “Who’s giving out signed

photos?”

Harry started to speak but he was cut short as

Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and

thundered jovially, “Shouldn’t have asked! We meet

again, Harry!”

Pinned to Lockhart’s side and burning with

humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back

into the crowd.

“Come on then, Mr. Creevey,” said Lockhart, beaming

at Colin. “A double portrait, can’t do better than that,

and well both sign it for you.”

Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as

the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of

afternoon classes.

“Off you go, move along there,” Lockhart called to the

crowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry,

who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell,

still clasped to his side.

 

“A word to the wise, Harry,” said Lockhart paternally

as they entered the building through a side door. “I

covered up for you back there with young Creevey —

if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates

won’t think you’re setting yourself up so much. ...”

Deaf to Harry’s stammers, Lockhart swept him down

a corridor lined with staring students and up a

staircase.

“Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at

this stage of your career isn’t sensible — looks a tad

bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a

time when, like me, you’ll need to keep a stack handy

wherever you go, but” — he gave a little chortle — “I

don’t think you’re quite there yet.”

They had reached Lockhart’s classroom and he let

Harry go at last. Harry yanked his robes straight and

headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where

he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart’s

books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking

at the real thing.

The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and

Hermione sat down on either side of Harry.

“You could’ve fried an egg on your face,” said Ron.

“You’d better hope Creevey doesn’t meet Ginny, or

they’ll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.”

“Shut up,” snapped Harry. The last thing he needed

was for Lockhart to hear the phrase “Harry Potter fan

club.”

When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared

his throat loudly and silence fell. He reached forward,

picked up Neville Longbottom’s copy of Travels with

 

Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking

portrait on the front.

“Me,” he said, pointing at it and winking as well.

“Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class,

Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League,

and five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-

Charming- Smile Award — but I don’t talk about that.

I didn’t get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at

her!”

He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled

weakly.

“I see you’ve all bought a complete set of my books —

well done. I thought we’d start today with a little quiz.

Nothing to worry about — just to check how well

you’ve read them, how much you’ve taken in — ”

When he had handed out the test papers he returned

to the front of the class and said, “You have thirty

minutes — start — now\”

Harry looked down at his paper and read:

1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s favorite color?

2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s secret ambition?

3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart’s

greatest achievement to date?

On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right

down to:

54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart’s birthday, and what

would his ideal gift be?

 

Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and

rifled through them in front of the class.

“Tut, tut — hardly any of you remembered that my

favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti.

And a few of you need to read Wanderings with

Werewolves more carefully — I clearly state in

chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be

harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples —

though I wouldn’t say no to a large bottle of Ogden’s

Old Firewhisky!”

He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now

staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on

his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who

were sitting in front, were shaking with silent

laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening

to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when

he mentioned her name.

"... but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret

ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my

own range of hair-care potions — good girl! In fact” —

he flipped her paper over — “full marks! Where is

Miss Hermione Granger?”

Hermione raised a trembling hand.

“Excellent!” beamed Lockhart. “Quite excellent! Take

ten points for Gryffindor! And so — to business — ”

He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large,

covered cage onto it.

“Now — be warned! It is my job to arm you against

the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may

find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.

Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am

here. All I ask is that you remain calm.”

 

In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of

books for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a

hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped

laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row

seat.

“I must ask you not to scream,” said Lockhart in a

low voice. “It might provoke them.”

As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped

off the cover.

“Yes,” he said dramatically. “ Freshly caught Cornish

pixies.”

Seamus Finnigan couldn’t control himself. He let out

a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn’t

mistake for a scream of terror.

“Yes?” He smiled at Seamus.

“Well, they’re not — they’re not very — dangerous, are

they?” Seamus choked.

“Don’t be so sure!” said Lockhart, waggling a finger

annoyingly at Seamus. “Devilish tricky little blighters

they can be!”

The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches

high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was

like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment

the cover had been removed, they had started

jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and

making bizarre faces at the people nearest them.

“Right, then,” Lockhart said loudly. “Let’s see what

you make of them!” And he opened the cage.

 

It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every

direction like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by

the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot

straight through the window, showering the back row

with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the

classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino.

They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with

them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from

the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags

and books and threw them out of the smashed

window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering

under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron

chandelier in the ceiling.

“Come on now — round them up, round them up,

they’re only pixies,” Lockhart shouted.

He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and

bellowed, “Peskipiksi Pesternomti”

It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his

wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart

gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly

avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second

later as the chandelier gave way.

The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the

exit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart

straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and

Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said,

“Well, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them

back into their cage.” He swept past them and shut

the door quickly behind him.

“Can you believe him?” roared Ron as one of the

remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear.

“He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,”

said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a

 

clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into

their cage.

“Hands on?” said Harry, who was trying to grab a

pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out.

“Hermione, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing

“Rubbish,” said Hermione. “You’ve read his books —

look at all those amazing things he’s done — ”

“He says he’s done,” Ron muttered.

MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS

Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days

dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy

Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid

was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized

Harry’s schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a

bigger thrill than to say, “All right, Harry?” six or

seven times a day and hear, “Hello, Colin,” back,

however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.

Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the

disasterous car journey and Ron’s wand was still

malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning

by shooting out of Ron’s hand in Charms and hitting

tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes,

creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had

struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was

quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and

Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday

morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several

hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver

Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.

 

“Whassamatter?” said Harry groggily.

“Quidditch practice!” said Wood. “Come on!”

Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist

hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he

was awake, he couldn’t understand how he could

have slept through the racket the birds were making.

“Oliver,” Harry croaked. “It’s the crack of dawn.”

“Exactly,” said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth

year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with

a crazed enthusiasm. “It’s part of our new training

program. Come on, grab your broom, and let’s go,”

said Wood heartily. “None of the other teams have

started training yet; we’re going to be first off the

mark this year — ”

Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of

bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes.

“Good man,” said Wood. “Meet you on the field in

fifteen minutes.”

When he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on

his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron

explaining where he’d gone and went down the spiral

staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two

Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the

portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and

Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral

staircase, his camera swinging madly around his

neck and something clutched in his hand.

“I heard someone saying your name on the stairs,

Harry! Look what I’ve got here! I’ve had it developed, I

wanted to show you — ”

 

Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was

brandishing under his nose.

A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard

on an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was

pleased to see that his photographic self was putting

up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view.

As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped,

panting, against the white edge of the picture.

“Will you sign it?” said Colin eagerly.

“No,” said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that

the room was really deserted. “Sorry, Colin, I’m in a

hurry — Quidditch practice — ”

He climbed through the portrait hole.

“Oh, wow! Wait for me! I’ve never watched a Quidditch

game before!”

Colin scrambled through the hole after him.

“It’ll be really boring,” Harry said quickly, but Colin

ignored him, his face shining with excitement.

“You were the youngest House player in a hundred

years, weren’t you, Harry? Weren’t you?” said Colin,

trotting alongside him. “You must be brilliant. I’ve

never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is

that the best one there is?”

Harry didn’t know how to get rid of him. It was like

having an extremely talkative shadow.

“I don’t really understand Quidditch,” said Colin

breathlessly. “Is it true there are four balls? And two

of them fly around trying to knock people off their

brooms?”

 

“Yes,” said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the

complicated rules of Quidditch. “They’re called

Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who

carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side.

Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.”

“And what are the other balls for?” Colin asked,

tripping down a couple of steps because he was

gazing open-mouthed at Harry.

“Well, the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is

the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each

team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get

it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch —

they’re three long poles with hoops on the end.”

“And the fourth ball — ”

“ — is the Golden Snitch,” said Harry, “and it’s very

small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that’s what

the Seeker’s got to do, because a game of Quidditch

doesn’t end until the Snitch has been caught. And

whichever team’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his

team an extra hundred and fifty points.”

“And you’re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren’t you?” said

Colin in awe.

“Yes,” said Harry as they left the castle and started

across the dew-drenched grass. “And there’s the

Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That’s it,

really.”

But Colin didn’t stop questioning Harry all the way

down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and

Harry only shook him off when he reached the

changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping

voice, “I’ll go and get a good seat, Harry!” and hurried

off to the stands.

 

The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the

changing room. Wood was the only person who looked

truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting,

puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year

Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against

the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell

and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side

opposite them.

“There you are, Harry, what kept you?” said Wood

briskly. “Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all

before we actually get onto the field, because I spent

the summer devising a whole new training program,

which I really think will make all the difference. ...”

Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch

field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and

crosses in different-colored inks. He took out his

wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to

wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood

launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred

Weasley’s head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet’s

shoulder and he began to snore.

The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain,

but there was another board under that, and a third

under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood

droned on and on.

“So,” said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a

wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for

breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. “Is

that clear? Any questions?”

“I’ve got a question, Oliver,” said George, who had

woken with a start. “Why couldn’t you have told us all

this yesterday when we were awake?”

Wood wasn’t pleased.

 

“Now, listen here, you lot,” he said, glowering at them

all. “We should have won the Quidditch Cup last year.

We’re easily the best team. But unfortunately —

owing to circumstances beyond our control — ”

Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been

unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match

of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had

been a player short and had suffered their worst

defeat in three hundred years.

Wood took a moment to regain control of himself.

Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him.

“So this year, we train harder than ever before. ...

Okay, let’s go and put our new theories into practice!”

Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the

way out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still

yawning, his team followed.

They had been in the locker room so long that the

sun was up completely now, although remnants of

mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry

walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione

sitting in the stands.

“Aren’t you finished yet?” called Ron incredulously.

“Haven’t even started,” said Harry, looking jealously

at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had

brought out of the Great Hall. “Wood’s been teaching

us new moves.”

He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the

ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air

whipped his face, waking him far more effectively

than Wood’s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on

the Quidditch field. He soared right around the

stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George.

 

“What’s that funny clicking noise?” called Fred as

they hurtled around the corner.

Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one

of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture

after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the

deserted stadium.

“Look this way, Harry! This way!” he cried shrilly.

“Who’s that?” said Fred.

“No idea,” Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that

took him as far away as possible from Colin.

“What’s going on?” said Wood, frowning, as he

skimmed through the air toward them. “Why’s that

first year taking pictures? I don’t like it. He could be a

Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new

training program.”

“He’s in Gryffindor,” said Harry quickly.

“And the Slytherins don’t need a spy, Oliver,” said

George.

“What makes you say that?” said Wood testily.

“Because they’re here in person,” said George,

pointing.

Several people in green robes were walking onto the

field, broomsticks in their hands.

“I don’t believe it!” Wood hissed in outrage. “I booked

the field for today! We’ll see about this!”

 

Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder

than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as

he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed.

“Flint!” Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. “This

is our practice time! We got up specially! You can

clear off now!”

Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a

look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied,

“Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.”

Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There

were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood

shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering

to a man.

“But I booked the field!” said Wood, positively spitting

with rage. “I booked it!”

“Ah,” said Flint. “But Tve got a specially signed note

here from Professor Snape. % Professor S. Snape, give

the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the

Quidditch field owinq to the need to train their new

Seeker. ’ ”

“You’ve got a new Seeker?” said Wood, distracted.

“Where?”

And from behind the six large figures before them

came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his

pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.

“Aren’t you Lucius Malfoy’s son?” said Fred, looking

at Malfoy with dislike.

“Funny you should mention Draco’s father,” said Flint

as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly.

 

“Let me show you the generous gift he’s made to the

Slytherin team.”

All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven

highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of

fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two

Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors’

noses in the early morning sun.

“Very latest model. Only came out last month,” said

Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end

of his own. “I believe it outstrips the old Two

Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the

old Cleansweeps” — he smiled nastily at Fred and

George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives —

“sweeps the board with them.”

None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything

to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly

his cold eyes were reduced to slits.

“Oh, look,” said Flint. “A field invasion.”

Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see

what was going on.

“What’s happening?” Ron asked Harry. “Why aren’t

you playing? And what’s he doing here?”

He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin

Quidditch robes.

“I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,” said Malfoy,

smugly. “Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms

my father’s bought our team.”

Ron gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb

broomsticks in front of him.

 

“Good, aren’t they?” said Malfoy smoothly. “But

perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some

gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off

those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would

bid for them.”

The Slytherin team howled with laughter.

“At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy

their way in,” said Hermione sharply. “They got in on

pure talent.”

The smug look on Malfoy’s face flickered.

“No one asked your opinion, you filthy little

Mudblood,” he spat.

Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something

really bad because there was an instant uproar at his

words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred

and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How

dare you\”, and Ron plunged his hand into his robes,

pulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one,

Malfoy!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm at

Malfoy’s face.

A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of

green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron’s wand,

hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling

backward onto the grass.

“Ron! Ron! Are you all right?” squealed Hermione.

Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came

out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and several

slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.

The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter.

Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new

 

broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours,

banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were

gathered around Ron, who kept belching large,

glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch

him.

“We’d better get him to Hagrid’s, it’s nearest,” said

Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair

of them pulled Ron up by the arms.

“What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill?

But you can cure him, can’t you?” Colin had run

down from his seat and was now dancing alongside

them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and

more slugs dribbled down his front.

“Oooh,” said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera.

“Can you hold him still, Harry?”

“Get out of the way, Colin!” said Harry angrily. He and

Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and

across the grounds toward the edge of the forest.

“Nearly there, Ron,” said Hermione as the

gamekeeper’s cabin came into view. “You’ll be all right

in a minute — almost there — ”

They were within twenty feet of Hagrid’s house when

the front door opened, but it wasn’t Hagrid who

emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest

mauve today, came striding out.

“Quick, behind here,” Harry hissed, dragging Ron

behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat

reluctantly.

“It’s a simple matter if you know what you’re doing!”

Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. “If you need

help, you know where I am! I’ll let you have a copy of

 

my book. I’m surprised you haven’t already got one —

I’ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!”

And he strode away toward the castle.

Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then

pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid’s front

door. They knocked urgently.

Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but

his expression brightened when he saw who it was.

“Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me — come

in, come in — thought you mighta bin Professor

Lockhart back again — ”

Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the

threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an

enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily

in the other. Hagrid didn’t seem perturbed by Ron’s

slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he

lowered Ron into a chair.

“Better out than in,” he said cheerfully, plunking a

large copper basin in front of him. “Get ’em all up,

Ron.”

“I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it

to stop,” said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend

over the basin. “That’s a difficult curse to work at the

best of times, but with a broken wand — ”

Hagrid was bustling around making them tea. His

boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry.

“What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?” Harry

asked, scratching Fang’s ears.

“Givin’ me advice on gettin’ kelpies out of a well,”

growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his

 

scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. “Like I

don’ know. An’ bangin’ on about some banshee he

banished. If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle.”

It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts

teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise.

Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher

than usual, “I think you’re being a bit unfair.

Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the

best man for the job — ”

“He was the on’y man for the job,” said Hagrid,

offering them a plate of treacle toffee, while Ron

coughed squelchily into his basin. “An’ I mean the

on’y one. Gettin’ very difficult ter find anyone fer the

Dark Arts job. People aren’t too keen ter take it on,

see. They’re startin’ ter think it’s jinxed. No one’s

lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,” said Hagrid,

jerking his head at Ron. “Who was he tryin’ ter

curse?”

“Malfoy called Hermione something — it must’ve been

really bad, because everyone went wild.”

“It was bad,” said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the

tabletop looking pale and sweaty. “Malfoy called her

‘Mudblood,’ Hagrid — ”

Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs

made their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged.

“He didn’!” he growled at Hermione.

“He did,” she said. “But I don’t know what it means. I

could tell it was really rude, of course — ”

“It’s about the most insulting thing he could think of,”

gasped Ron, coming back up. “Mudblood’s a really

foul name for someone who is Muggle-born — you

 

know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards —

like Malfoy’s family — who think they’re better than

everyone else because they’re what people call pure-

blood.” He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell

into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin

and continued, “I mean, the rest of us know it doesn’t

make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom

— he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a

cauldron the right way up.”

“An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Hermione can’

do,” said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a

brilliant shade of magenta.

“It’s a disgusting thing to call someone,” said Ron,

wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. “Dirty

blood, see. Common blood. It’s ridiculous. Most

wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we

hadn’t married Muggles we’d’ve died out.”

He retched and ducked out of sight again.

“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron,”

said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs

hitting the basin. “Bu’ maybe it was a good thing yer

wand backfired. ’Spect Lucius Malfoy would’ve come

marchin’ up ter school if yeh’d cursed his son. Least

yer not in trouble.”

Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn’t

come much worse than having slugs pouring out of

your mouth, but he couldn’t; Hagrid’s treacle toffee

had cemented his jaws together.

“Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a

sudden thought. “Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I’ve

heard you’ve bin givin’ out signed photos. How come I

haven’t got one?”

 

Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.

“I have not been giving out signed photos,” he said

hotly. “If Lockhart’s still spreading that around — ”

But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.

“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting Harry genially on the

back and sending him face first into the table. “I knew

yeh hadn’t really. I told Lockhart yeh didn’ need teh.

Yer more famous than him without tryin’.”

“Bet he didn’t like that,” said Harry, sitting up and

rubbing his chin.

“Don’ think he did,” said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling.

“An’ then I told him I’d never read one o’ his books an’

he decided ter go. Treacle toffee, Ron?” he added as

Ron reappeared.

“No thanks,” said Ron weakly. “Better not risk it.”

“Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said Hagrid as

Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea.

In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid ’s house

were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever

seen. Each was the size of a large boulder.

“Gettin’ on well, aren’t they?” said Hagrid happily.

“Fer the Halloween feast ... should be big enough by

then.”

“What’ve you been feeding them?” said Harry.

Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they

were alone.

 

“Well, I’ve bin givin’ them — you know — a bit o’ help

Harry noticed Hagrid’s flowery pink umbrella leaning

against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had

reason to believe before now that this umbrella was

not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression

that Hagrid’s old school wand was concealed inside it.

Hagrid wasn’t supposed to use magic. He had been

expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry

had never found out why — any mention of the

matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and

become mysteriously deaf until the subject was

changed.

“An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?” said Hermione,

halfway between disapproval and amusement. “Well,

you’ve done a good job on them.”

“That’s what yer little sister said,” said Hagrid,

nodding at Ron. “Met her jus’ yesterday.” Hagrid

looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. “Said

she was jus’ lookin’ round the grounds, but I reckon

she was hopin’ she might run inter someone else at

my house.” He winked at Harry. “If yeh ask me, she

wouldn’ say no ter a signed — ”

“Oh, shut up,” said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter

and the ground was sprayed with slugs.

“Watch it!” Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his

precious pumpkins.

It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had

one bit of treacle toffee since dawn, he was keen to go

back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid

and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing

occasionally, but only bringing up two very small

slugs.

 

They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall

when a voice rang out, “There you are, Potter —

Weasley.” Professor McGonagall was walking toward

them, looking stern. “You will both do your detentions

this evening.”

“What’re we doing, Professor?” said Ron, nervously

suppressing a burp.

“ You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room

with Mr. Filch,” said Professor McGonagall. “And no

magic, Weasley — elbow grease.”

Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed

by every student in the school.

“And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart

answer his fan mail,” said Professor McGonagall.

“Oh n — Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room,

too?” said Harry desperately.

“Certainly not,” said Professor McGonagall, raising

her eyebrows. “Professor Lockhart requested you

particularly. Eight o’clock sharp, both of you.”

Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states

of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a

well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression.

Harry didn’t enjoy his shepherd’s pie as much as he’d

thought. Both he and Ron felt they’d got the worse

deal.

“Filch ’ll have me there all night,” said Ron heavily.

“No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in

that room. I’m no good at Muggle cleaning.”

 

“I’d swap anytime,” said Harry hollowly. “I’ve had

loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering

Lockhart’s fan mail ... he’ll be a nightmare. ...”

Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what

seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and

Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor

corridor to Lockhart’s office. He gritted his teeth and

knocked.

The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at

him.

“Ah, here’s the scalawag!” he said. “Come in, Harry,

come in — ”

Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many

candles were countless framed photographs of

Lockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another

large pile lay on his desk.

“You can address the envelopes!” Lockhart told Harry,

as though this was a huge treat. “This first one’s to

Gladys Gudgeon, bless her — huge fan of mine — ”

The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart’s voice

wash over him, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and

“Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then he caught a phrase

like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, Harry,” or “Celebrity is as

celebrity does, remember that.”

The candles burned lower and lower, making the light

dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart

watching him. Harry moved his aching hand over

what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out

Veronica Smethley’s address. It must be nearly time to

leave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly

time. ...

 

And then he heard something — something quite

apart from the spitting of the dying candles and

Lockhart’s prattle about his fans.

It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a

voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom.

“Come ... come to me. ... Let me rip you. ... Let me tear

you. ... Let me kill you. ...”

Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot

appeared on Veronica Smethley’s street.

“What?” he said loudly.

“I know!” said Lockhart. “Six solid months at the top

of the best-seller list! Broke all records!”

“No,” said Harry frantically. “That voice!”

“Sorry?” said Lockhart, looking puzzled. “What voice?”

“That — that voice that said — didn’t you hear it?”

Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.

“What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you’re

getting a little drowsy? Great Scott — look at the time!

“We’ve been here nearly four hours! I’d never have

believed it — the time’s flown, hasn’t it?”

Harry didn’t answer. He was straining his ears to hear

the voice again, but there was no sound now except

for Lockhart telling him he mustn’t expect a treat like

this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry

left.

It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was

almost empty. Harry went straight up to the

 

dormitory. Ron wasn’t back yet. Harry pulled on his

pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later,

Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a

strong smell of polish into the darkened room.

“My muscles have all seized up,” he groaned, sinking

on his bed. “Fourteen times he made me buff up that

Quidditch Cup before he was satisfied. And then I

had another slug attack all over a Special Award for

Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off.

. . . How was it with Lockhart?”

Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean,

and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had

heard.

“And Lockhart said he couldn’t hear it?” said Ron.

Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight.

“D’you think he was lying? But I don’t get it — even

someone invisible would’ve had to open the door.”

“I know,” said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and

staring at the canopy above him. “I don’t get it either.”

 

d

THE DEATHDAY PARTY

October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the

grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the

nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds

among the staff and students. Her Pepperup Potion

worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking

at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny

Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into

taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under

her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole

head was on fire.

Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle

windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower

beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid’s

pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver

Wood’s enthusiasm for regular training sessions,

however, was not dampened, which was why Harry

was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon

a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor

Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.

Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn’t been a

happy practice session. Fred and George, who had

 

been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for

themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two

Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin

team was no more than seven greenish blurs,

shooting through the air like missiles.

As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he

came across somebody who looked just as

preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the

ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of

a window, muttering under his breath, "... don’t fulfill

their requirements ... half an inch, if that ...”

“Hello, Nick,” said Harry.

“Hello, hello,” said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and

looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his

long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which

concealed the fact that his neck was almost

completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry

could see right through him to the dark sky and

torrential rain outside.

“You look troubled, young Potter,” said Nick, folding a

transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside

his doublet.

“So do you,” said Harry.

“Ah,” Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, “a

matter of no importance. ... It’s not as though I really

wanted to join. ... Thought I’d apply, but apparently I

‘don’t fulfill requirements’ — ”

In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great

bitterness on his face.

“But you would think, wouldn’t you,” he erupted

suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket,

 

“that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a

blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless

Hunt?”

“Oh — yes,” said Harry, who was obviously supposed

to agree.

“I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all

been quick and clean, and my head had come off

properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal

of pain and ridicule. However — ” Nearly Headless

Nick shook his letter open and read furiously:

“ ‘We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have

parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate

that it would be impossible otherwise for members to

participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-

Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret,

therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill

our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick

Delaney -Podmore.’ ”

Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.

“Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on,

Harry! Most people would think that’s good and

beheaded, but oh, no, it’s not enough for Sir Properly

Decapitated-Podmore . ”

Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and

then said, in a far calmer tone, “So — what’s

bothering you? Anything I can do?”

“No,” said Harry. “Not unless you know where we can

get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for

our match against Sly — ”

The rest of Harry’s sentence was drowned out by a

high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his

 

ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into

a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the

skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker,

Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle

against students.

“You’d better get out of here, Harry,” said Nick

quickly. “Filch isn’t in a good mood — he’s got the flu

and some third years accidentally plastered frog

brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He’s been

cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud

all over the place — ”

“Right,” said Harry, backing away from the accusing

stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn

to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to

connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst

suddenly through a tapestry to Harry’s right,

wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-

breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around

his head, and his nose was unusually purple.

“Filth!” he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes

popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy

puddle that had dripped from Harry’s Quidditch

robes. “Mess and muck everywhere! I’ve had enough

of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!”

So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless

Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the

number of muddy footprints on the floor.

Harry had never been inside Filch’s office before; it

was a place most students avoided. The room was

dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp

dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried

fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets

stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could

see that they contained details of every pupil Filch

 

had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an

entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished

collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall

behind Filch’s desk. It was common knowledge that

he was always begging Dumbledore to let him

suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.

Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and

began shuffling around looking for parchment.

“Dung,” he muttered furiously, “great sizzling dragon

bogies ... frog brains ... rat intestines ... I’ve had

enough of it ... make an example ... where’s the form

... yes ...”

He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk

drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping

his long black quill into the ink pot.

“ Name ... Harry Potter. Crime ...”

“It was only a bit of mud!” said Harry.

“It’s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it’s an

extra hour scrubbing!” shouted Filch, a drip shivering

unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. “Crime

... befouling the castle ... suggested sentence ...”

Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted

unpleasantly at Harry, who waited with bated breath

for his sentence to fall.

But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great

BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil

lamp rattle.

“PEEVES!” Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a

transport of rage. “I’ll have you this time, I’ll have

you!”

 

And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran

flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking

alongside him.

Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne

menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry

didn’t much like Peeves, but couldn’t help feeling

grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves

had done (and it sounded as though he’d wrecked

something very big this time) would distract Filch

from Harry.

Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to

come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next

to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from

his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple

envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a

quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn’t on

his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read:

KWIKSPELL

A Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic

Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled

out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver

writing on the front page said:

Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find

yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells?

Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork?

There is an answer!

Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-

learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have

benefited from the Kwikspell method!

Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes:

 

“I had no memory for incantations and my potions

were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am

the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the

recipe of my Scintillation Solution!”

Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says:

“My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one

month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I

succeeded in turning her into a yak!

Thank you, Kwikspell!”

Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the

envelope’s contents. Why on earth did Filch want a

Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn’t a proper

wizard? Harry was just reading “Lesson One: Holding

Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)” when shuffling

footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back.

Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry

threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened.

Filch was looking triumphant.

“That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he

was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. “We’ll have Peeves

out this time, my sweet — ”

His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the

Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late,

was lying two feet away from where it had started.

Filch ’s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced

himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across

to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it

into a drawer.

“Have you — did you read — ?” he sputtered.

 

“No,” Harry lied quickly.

Filch ’s knobbly hands were twisting together.

“If I thought you’d read my private — not that it’s

mine — for a friend — be that as it may — however —

Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never

looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was

going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan

scarf didn’t help.

“Very well — go — and don’t breathe a word — not

that — however, if you didn’t read — go now, I have to

write up Peeves’ report — go — ”

Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up

the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from

Filch ’s office without punishment was probably some

kind of school record.

“Harry! Harry! Did it work?”

Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom.

Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large

black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been

dropped from a great height.

“I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch’s

office,” said Nick eagerly. “Thought it might distract

him — ”

“Was that you?” said Harry gratefully. “Yeah, it

worked, I didn’t even get detention. Thanks, Nick!”

They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless

Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick’s

rejection letter.

 

“I wish there was something I could do for you about

the Headless Hunt,” Harry said.

Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry

walked right through him. He wished he hadn’t; it

was like stepping through an icy shower.

“But there is something you could do for me,” said

Nick excitedly. “Harry — would I be asking too much

— but no, you wouldn’t want — ”

“What is it?” said Harry.

“Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth

deathday,” said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing

himself up and looking dignified.

“Oh,” said Harry, not sure whether he should look

sorry or happy about this. “Right.”

“I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier

dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the

country. It would be such an honor if you would

attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most

welcome, too, of course — but I daresay you’d rather

go to the school feast?” He watched Harry on

tenterhooks.

“No,” said Harry quickly, “I’ll come — ”

“My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party!

And” — he hesitated, looking excited — “do you think

you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very

frightening and impressive you find me?”

“Of — of course,” said Harry.

Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him.

 

“A deathday party?” said Hermione keenly when

Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in

the common room. “I bet there aren’t many living

people who can say they’ve been to one of those — it’ll

be fascinating!”

“Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they

died?” said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions

homework and grumpy. “Sounds dead depressing to

me....”

Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now

inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful.

The firelight glowed over the countless squashy

armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing

homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley,

trying to find out what would happen if you fed a

Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had

“rescued” the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard

from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was

now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a

knot of curious people.

Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione

about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the

salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting

loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the

room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at

Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine

stars showering from the salamander’s mouth, and its

escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions,

drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from

Harry’s mind.

By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting

his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest

of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween

feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the

usual live bats, Hagrid’s vast pumpkins had been

 

carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit

in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had

booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the

entertainment.

“A promise is a promise,” Hermione reminded Harry

bossily. “You said you’d go to the deathday party.”

So at seven o’clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked

straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall,

which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and

candles, and directed their steps instead toward the

dungeons.

The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick’s

party had been lined with candles, too, though the

effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin,

jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a

dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The

temperature dropped with every step they took. As

Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around

him, he heard what sounded like a thousand

fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.

“Is that supposed to be music?” Ron whispered. They

turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick

standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.

“My dear friends,” he said mournfully. “Welcome,

welcome ... so pleased you could come. ...”

He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.

It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of

hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly

drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the

dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws,

played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped

platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue

 

with a thousand more black candles. Their breath

rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a

freezer.

“Shall we have a look around?” Harry suggested,

wanting to warm up his feet.

“Careful not to walk through anyone,” said Ron

nervously, and they set off around the edge of the

dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a

ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a

cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight

with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry

wasn’t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a

gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver

bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the

other ghosts.

“Oh, no,” said Hermione, stopping abruptly. “Turn

back, turn back, I don’t want to talk to Moaning

Myrtle — ”

“Who?” said Harry as they backtracked quickly.

“She haunts one of the toilets in the girls’ bathroom

on the first floor,” said Hermione.

“She haunts a toilet ?”

“Yes. It’s been out-of-order all year because she keeps

having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went

in there anyway if I could avoid it; it’s awful trying to

have a pee with her wailing at you — ”

“Look, food!” said Ron.

On the other side of the dungeon was a long table,

also covered in black velvet. They approached it

eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks,

 

horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large,

rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters;

cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on

salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of

cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of

place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a

tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words,

SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON

DIED 3 1 ST OCTOBER, 1 492

Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached

the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his

mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the

stinking salmon.

“Can you taste it if you walk through it?” Harry asked

him.

“Almost,” said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.

“I expect they’ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,”

said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and

leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.

“Can we move? I feel sick,” said Ron.

They had barely turned around, however, when a

little man swooped suddenly from under the table and

came to a halt in midair before them.

“Hello, Peeves,” said Harry cautiously.

Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist

was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was

wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie,

and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.

 

“Nibbles?” he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of

peanuts covered in fungus.

“No thanks,” said Hermione.

“Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,” said Peeves,

his eyes dancing. “Rude you was about poor Myrtle.”

He took a deep breath and bellowed, “OY! MYRTLE!”

“Oh, no, Peeves, don’t tell her what I said, she’ll be

really upset,” Hermione whispered frantically. “I didn’t

mean it, I don’t mind her — er, hello, Myrtle.”

The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the

glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden

behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.

“What?” she said sulkily.

“How are you, Myrtle?” said Hermione in a falsely

bright voice. “It’s nice to see you out of the toilet.”

Myrtle sniffed.

“Miss Granger was just talking about you — ” said

Peeves slyly in Myrtle’s ear.

“Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight,”

said Hermione, glaring at Peeves.

Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.

“You’re making fun of me,” she said, silver tears

welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes.

“No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s

looking?” said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron

painfully in the ribs.

 

“Oh, yeah — ”

“She did — ”

“Don’t lie to me,” Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding

down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her

shoulder. “D’you think I don’t know what people call

me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle!

Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!”

“You’ve forgotten pimply,” Peeves hissed in her ear.

Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled

from the dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting her

with moldy peanuts, yelling, “Pimply\ Pimplyl”

“Oh, dear,” said Hermione sadly.

Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them

through the crowd.

“Enjoying yourselves?”

“Oh, yes,” they lied.

“Not a bad turnout,” said Nearly Headless Nick

proudly. “The Wailing Widow came all the way up

from Kent. ... It’s nearly time for my speech, I’d better

go and warn the orchestra. ...”

The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very

moment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell

silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting

horn sounded.

“Oh, here we go,” said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.

Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost

horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The

 

assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too,

but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick’s face.

The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor

and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the

pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head

under his arm, from which position he was blowing

the horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high

in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone

laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick,

squashing his head back onto his neck.

“Nick!” he roared. “How are you? Head still hanging in

there?”

He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless

Nick on the shoulder.

“Welcome, Patrick,” said Nick stiffly.

“Live ’uns!” said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and

Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of

astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the

crowd howled with laughter).

“Very amusing,” said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.

“Don’t mind Nick!” shouted Sir Patrick’s head from

the floor. “Still upset we won’t let him join the Hunt!

But I mean to say — look at the fellow — ”

“I think,” said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look

from Nick, “Nick’s very — frightening and — er — ”

“Ha!” yelled Sir Patrick’s head. “Bet he asked you to

say that!”

“If I could have everyone’s attention, it’s time for my

speech!” said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding

 

toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue

spotlight.

“My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is

my great sorrow ...”

But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the

rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of

Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch.

Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his

audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick’s head went

sailing past him to loud cheers.

Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.

“I can’t stand much more of this,” Ron muttered, his

teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into

action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance

floor.

“Let’s go,” Harry agreed.

They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming

at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later

were hurrying back up the passageway full of black

candles.

“Pudding might not be finished yet,” said Ron

hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the

entrance hall.

And then Harry heard it.

"... rip ... tear ... kill ...”

It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous

voice he had heard in Lockhart’s office.

 

He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall,

listening with all his might, looking around, squinting

up and down the dimly lit passageway.

“Harry, what’re you — ?”

“It’s that voice again — shut up a minute — ”

soo hungry ... for so long ...”

“Listen!” said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione

froze, watching him.

“... kill ... time to kill ...”

The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was

moving away — moving upward. A mixture of fear and

excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark

ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a

phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn’t matter?

“This way,” he shouted, and he began to run, up the

stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to

hear anything here, the babble of talk from the

Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall.

Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first

floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.

“Harry, what’re we — ”

“SHH!”

Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor

above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice:

“...I smell blood. ...I SMELL BLOOD\”

His stomach lurched —

 

“It’s going to kill someone!” he shouted, and ignoring

Ron’s and Hermione’s bewildered faces, he ran up the

next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen

over his own pounding footsteps —

Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor,

Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping

until they turned a corner into the last, deserted

passage.

“Harry, what was that all about?” said Ron, wiping

sweat off his face. “I couldn’t hear anything. ...”

But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the

corridor.

“Loo/c!”

Something was shining on the wall ahead. They

approached slowly, squinting through the darkness.

Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall

between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by

the flaming torches.

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED.

ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.

“What’s that thing — hanging underneath?” said Ron,

a slight quiver in his voice.

As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped — there

was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and

Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the

message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All

three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt

backward with a splash.

 

Mrs. Norris, the caretaker’s cat, was hanging by her

tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board,

her eyes wide and staring.

For a few seconds, they didn’t move. Then Ron said,

“Let’s get out of here.”

“Shouldn’t we try and help — ” Harry began

awkwardly.

“Trust me,” said Ron. “We don’t want to be found

here.”

But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant

thunder, told them that the feast had just ended.

From either end of the corridor where they stood

came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the

stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people;

next moment, students were crashing into the

passage from both ends.

The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as

the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry,

Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the

corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students

pressing forward to see the grisly sight.

Then someone shouted through the quiet.

“Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next,

Mudbloods!”

It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of

the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless

face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the

hanging, immobile cat.

THE WRITING ON THE WALL

“What’s going on here? What’s going on?”

Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch

came shouldering his way through the crowd. Then

he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in

horror.

“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he

shrieked.

And his popping eyes fell on Harry.

“You!” he screeched. “You! You’ve murdered my cat!

You’ve killed her! I’ll kill you! I’ll — ”

“Argus'.”

Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a

number of other teachers. In seconds, he had swept

past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs.

Norris from the torch bracket.

 

“Come with me, Argus,” he said to Filch. “You, too,

Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.”

Lockhart stepped forward eagerly.

“My office is nearest, Headmaster — just upstairs —

please feel free — ”

“Thank you, Gilderoy,” said Dumbledore.

The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart,

looking excited and important, hurried after

Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and

Snape.

As they entered Lockhart’s darkened office there was

a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw

several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of

sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit the

candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore laid

Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to

examine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged

tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of

candlelight, watching.

The tip of Dumbledore ’s long, crooked nose was

barely an inch from Mrs. Norris’s fur. He was looking

at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his

long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor

McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes

narrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in

shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was

as though he was trying hard not to smile. And

Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making

suggestions.

“It was definitely a curse that killed her — probably

the Trans-mogrifian Torture — I’ve seen it used many

 

times, so unlucky I wasn’t there, I know the very

countercurse that would have saved her. ...”

Lockhart’s comments were punctuated by Filch ’s dry,

racking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk,

unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands.

Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn’t help feeling

a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he

felt for himself. If Dumbledore believed Filch, he

would be expelled for sure.

Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under

his breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but

nothing happened: She continued to look as though

she had been recently stuffed.

"... I remember something very similar happening in

Ouagadougou,” said Lockhart, “a series of attacks,

the full story’s in my autobiography, I was able to

provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which

cleared the matter up at once. ...”

The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all

nodding in agreement as he talked. One of them had

forgotten to remove his hair net.

At last Dumbledore straightened up.

“She’s not dead, Argus,” he said softly.

Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting

the number of murders he had prevented.

“Not dead?” choked Filch, looking through his fingers

at Mrs. Norris. “But why’s she all — all stiff and

frozen?”

 

“She has been Petrified,” said Dumbledore (“Ah! I

thought so!” said Lockhart). “But how, I cannot say.

“Ask him\” shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and

tearstained face to Harry.

“No second year could have done this,” said

Dumbledore firmly. “It would take Dark Magic of the

most advanced — ”

“He did it, he did it!” Filch spat, his pouchy face

purpling. “You saw what he wrote on the wall! He

found — in my office — he knows I’m a — I’m a — ”

Filch ’s face worked horribly. “He knows I’m a Squib!”

he finished.

“I never touched Mrs. Norris!” Harry said loudly,

uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him,

including all the Lockharts on the walls. “And I don’t

even know what a Squib is.”

“Rubbish!” snarled Filch. “He saw my Kwikspell

letter!”

“If I might speak, Headmaster,” said Snape from the

shadows, and Harry’s sense of foreboding increased;

he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to

do him any good.

“Potter and his friends may have simply been in the

wrong place at the wrong time,” he said, a slight sneer

curling his mouth as though he doubted it. “But we

do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why

was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn’t he

at the Halloween feast?”

 

Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an

explanation about the deathday party. "... there were

hundreds of ghosts, they’ll tell you we were there — ”

“But why not join the feast afterward?” said Snape,

his black eyes glittering in the candlelight. “Why go

up to that corridor?”

Ron and Hermione looked at Harry.

“Because — because — ” Harry said, his heart

thumping very fast; something told him it would

sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led

there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,

“because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,” he

said.

“Without any supper?” said Snape, a triumphant

smile flickering across his gaunt face. “I didn’t think

ghosts provided food fit for living people at their

parties.”

“We weren’t hungry,” said Ron loudly as his stomach

gave a huge rumble.

Snape’s nasty smile widened.

“I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being

entirely truthful,” he said. “It might be a good idea if

he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready

to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should

be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is

ready to be honest.”

“Really, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall sharply,

“I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch.

This cat wasn’t hit over the head with a broomstick.

There is no evidence at all that Potter has done

anything wrong.”

 

Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His

twinkling light-blue gaze made Harry feel as though

he were being X-rayed.

“Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,” he said

firmly.

Snape looked furious. So did Filch.

“My cat has been Petrified!” he shrieked, his eyes

popping. “I want to see some punishmenti”

“We will be able to cure her, Argus,” said Dumbledore

patiently. “Professer Sprout recently managed to

procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have

reached their full size, I will have a potion made that

will revive Mrs. Norris.”

“I’ll make it,” Lockhart butted in. “I must have done it

a hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake

Restorative Draught in my sleep — ”

“Excuse me,” said Snape icily. “But I believe I am the

Potions master at this school.”

There was a very awkward pause.

“You may go,” Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and

Hermione.

They went, as quickly as they could without actually

running. When they were a floor up from Lockhart’s

office, they turned into an empty classroom and

closed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted

at his friends’ darkened faces.

“D’you think I should have told them about that voice

I heard?”

 

“No,” said Ron, without hesitation. “Hearing voices no

one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the

wizarding world.”

Something in Ron’s voice made Harry ask, “You do

believe me, don’t you?”

“ ’Course I do,” said Ron quickly. “But — you must

admit it’s weird. ...”

“I know it’s weird,” said Harry. “The whole thing’s

weird. What was that writing on the wall about? The

Chamber Has Been Opened’. ... What’s that supposed

to mean?”

“You know, it rings a sort of bell,” said Ron slowly. “I

think someone told me a story about a secret

chamber at Hogwarts once ... might’ve been Bill. ...”

“And what on earth’s a Squib?” said Harry.

To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.

“Well — it’s not funny really — but as it’s Filch,” he

said. “A Squib is someone who was born into a

wizarding family but hasn’t got any magic powers.

Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but

Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch ’s trying to learn

magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a

Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates

students so much.” Ron gave a satisfied smile. “He’s

bitter.”

A clock chimed somewhere.

“Midnight,” said Harry. “We’d better get to bed before

Snape comes along and tries to frame us for

something else.”

 

For a few days, the school could talk of little else but

the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in

everyone’s minds by pacing the spot where she had

been attacked, as though he thought the attacker

might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the

message on the wall with Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose

Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words

still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When

Filch wasn’t guarding the scene of the crime, he was

skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out

at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in

detention for things like “breathing loudly” and

“looking happy.”

Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs.

Norris’s fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat

lover.

“But you haven’t really got to know Mrs. Norris,” Ron

told her bracingly. “Honestly, we’re much better off

without her.” Ginny ’s lip trembled. “Stuff like this

doesn’t often happen at Hogwarts,” Ron assured her.

“They’ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out

of here in no time. I just hope he’s got time to Petrify

Filch before he’s expelled. I’m only joking — ” Ron

added hastily as Ginny blanched.

The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was

quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time

reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else.

Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her

when they asked what she was up to, and not until

the following Wednesday did they find out.

Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape

had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off

 

the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to

meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-

Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming

toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say

hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned

abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.

Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring

his History of Magic homework. Professor Binns had

asked for a three-foot-long composition on “The

Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.”

“I don’t believe it, I’m still eight inches short. ...” said

Ron furiously, letting go of his parchment, which

sprang back into a roll. “And Hermione’s done four

feet seven inches and her writing’s tiny.”

“Where is she?” asked Harry, grabbing the tape

measure and unrolling his own homework.

“Somewhere over there,” said Ron, pointing along the

shelves. “Looking for another book. I think she’s

trying to read the whole library before Christmas.”

Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running

away from him.

“Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an

idiot,” said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing

as large as possible. “All that junk about Lockhart

being so great — ”

Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves.

She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk

to them.

“All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken

out,” she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron.

“And there’s a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn’t

 

left my copy at home, but I couldn’t fit it in my trunk

with all the Lockhart books.”

“Why do you want it?” said Harry.

“The same reason everyone else wants it,” said

Hermione, “to read up on the legend of the Chamber

of Secrets.”

“What’s that?” said Harry quickly.

“That’s just it. I can’t remember,” said Hermione,

biting her lip. “And I can’t find the story anywhere

else — ”

“Hermione, let me read your composition,” said Ron

desperately, checking his watch.

“No, I won’t,” said Hermione, suddenly severe. “You’ve

had ten days to finish it — ”

“I only need another two inches, come on — ”

The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to

History of Magic, bickering.

History of Magic was the dullest subject on their

schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their

only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that

ever happened in his classes was his entering the

room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled,

many people said he hadn’t noticed he was dead. He

had simply got up to teach one day and left his body

behind him in an armchair in front of the staffroom

fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.

Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened

his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old

vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was

 

in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough

to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep

again. He had been speaking for half an hour when

something happened that had never happened before.

Hermione put up her hand.

Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly

dull lecture on the International Warlock Convention

of 1289, looked amazed.

“Miss — er — ?”

“Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell

us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,” said

Hermione in a clear voice.

Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth

hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of

his trance; Lavender Brown’s head came up off her

arms and Neville Longbottom’s elbow slipped off his

desk.

Professor Binns blinked.

“My subject is History of Magic,” he said in his dry,

wheezy voice. “I deal with, facts, Miss Granger, not

myths and legends.” He cleared his throat with a

small noise like chalk snapping and continued, “In

September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian

sorcerers — ”

He stuttered to a halt. Hermione’s hand was waving

in the air again.

“Miss Grant?”

“Please, sir, don’t legends always have a basis in

fact?”

 

Professor Binns was looking at her in such

amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever

interrupted him before, alive or dead.

“Well,” said Professor Binns slowly, “yes, one could

argue that, I suppose.” He peered at Hermione as

though he had never seen a student properly before.

“However, the legend of which you speak is such a

very sensational, even ludicrous tale — ”

But the whole class was now hanging on Professor

Binns ’s every word. He looked dimly at them all, every

face turned to his. Harry could tell he was completely

thrown by such an unusual show of interest.

“Oh, very well,” he said slowly. “Let me see ... the

Chamber of Secrets . . .

“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded

over a thousand years ago — the precise date is

uncertain — by the four greatest witches and wizards

of the age. The four school Houses are named after

them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena

Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this

castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was

an age when magic was feared by common people,

and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.”

He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and

continued.

“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony

together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of

magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated.

But then disagreements sprang up between them. A

rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others.

Slytherin wished to be more selective about the

students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that

magical learning should be kept within all-magic

 

families. He disliked taking students of Muggle

parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After

a while, there was a serious argument on the subject

between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left

the school.”

Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips,

looking like a wrinkled old tortoise.

“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he

said. “But these honest facts have been obscured by

the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The

story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber

in the castle, of which the other founders knew

nothing.

“Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the

Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to

open it until his own true heir arrived at the school.

The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber

of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to

purge the school of all who were unworthy to study

magic.”

There was silence as he finished telling the story, but

it wasn’t the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor

Binns ’s classes. There was unease in the air as

everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more.

Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.

“The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,” he

said. “Naturally, the school has been searched for

evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most

learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale

told to frighten the gullible.”

Hermione’s hand was back in the air.

 

“Sir — what exactly do you mean by the ‘horror

within’ the Chamber?”

“That is believed to be some sort of monster, which

the Heir of Slytherin alone can control,” said Professor

Binns in his dry, reedy voice.

The class exchanged nervous looks.

“I tell you, the thing does not exist,” said Professor

Binns, shuffling his notes. “There is no Chamber and

no monster.”

“But, sir,” said Seamus Finnigan, “if the Chamber can

only be opened by Slytherin’s true heir, no one else

would be able to find it, would they?”

“Nonsense, O’Flaherty,” said Professor Binns in an

aggravated tone. “If a long succession of Hogwarts

headmasters and headmistresses haven’t found the

thing — ”

“But, Professor,” piped up Parvati Patil, “you’d

probably have to use Dark Magic to open it — ”

“Just because a wizard doesn’t use Dark Magic

doesn’t mean he can’t, Miss Pennyfeather,” snapped

Professor Binns. “I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore

“But maybe you’ve got to be related to Slytherin, so

Dumbledore couldn’t — ” began Dean Thomas, but

Professor Binns had had enough.

“That will do,” he said sharply. “It is a myth! It does

not exist! There is not a shred of evidence that

Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom

cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We

 

will return, if you please, to history, to solid,

believable, verifiable facti”

And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into

its usual torpor.

“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old

loony,” Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought

their way through the teeming corridors at the end of

the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I

never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I

wouldn’t be in his House if you paid me. Honestly, if

the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve

got the train straight back home. ...”

Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say

anything. His stomach had just dropped

unpleasantly.

Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the

Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in

Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were

yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear

when he’d placed the hat on his head a year before:

You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your

head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to

greatness, no doubt about that. . . .

But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin

House’s reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had

thought desperately, Not Slytherin ! and the hat had

said, Oh, well, if you’re sure ... better be Gryffindor. ...

As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin

Creevey went past.

“Hiya, Harry!”

“Hullo, Colin,” said Harry automatically.

 

“Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying

you’re — ”

But Colin was so small he couldn’t fight against the

tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they

heard him squeak, “See you, Harry!” and he was

gone.

“What’s a boy in his class saying about you?”

Hermione wondered.

“That I’m Slytherin’s heir, I expect,” said Harry, his

stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly

remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run

away from him at lunchtime.

“People here’ll believe anything,” said Ron in disgust.

The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the

next staircase without difficulty.

“D’you really think there’s a Chamber of Secrets?”

Ron asked Hermione.

“I don’t know,” she said, frowning. “Dumbledore

couldn’t cure Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think

that whatever attacked her might not be — well —

human.”

As she spoke, they turned a corner and found

themselves at the end of the very corridor where the

attack had happened. They stopped and looked. The

scene was just as it had been that night, except that

there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket,

and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the

message “The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened.”

“That’s where Filch has been keeping guard,” Ron

muttered.

 

They looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.

“Can’t hurt to have a poke around,” said Harry,

dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees

so that he could crawl along, searching for clues.

“Scorch marks!” he said. “Here — and here — ”

“Come and look at this!” said Hermione. “This is

funny. ...”

Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the

message on the wall. Hermione was pointing at the

topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were

scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small

crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope,

as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get

outside.

“Have you ever seen spiders act like that?” said

Hermione wonderingly.

“No,” said Harry, “have you, Ron? Ron?”

He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well

back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run.

“What’s up?” said Harry.

“I — don’t — like — spiders,” said Ron tensely.

“I never knew that,” said Hermione, looking at Ron in

surprise. “You’ve used spiders in Potions loads of

times. ...”

“I don’t mind them dead,” said Ron, who was carefully

looking anywhere but at the window. “I just don’t like

the way they move. ...”

 

Hermione giggled.

“It’s not funny,” said Ron, fiercely. “If you must know,

when I was three, Fred turned my — my teddy bear

into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy

broomstick. ... You wouldn’t like them either if you’d

been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many

legs and ...”

He broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously

still trying not to laugh. Feeling they had better get off

the subject, Harry said, “Remember all that water on

the floor? Where did that come from? Someone’s

mopped it up.”

“It was about here,” said Ron, recovering himself to

walk a few paces past Filch’s chair and pointing.

“Level with this door.”

He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly

withdrew his hand as though he’d been burned.

“What’s the matter?” said Harry.

“Can’t go in there,” said Ron gruffly. “That’s a girls’

toilet.”

“Oh, Ron, there won’t be anyone in there,” said

Hermione, standing up and coming over. “That’s

Moaning Myrtle’s place. Come on, let’s have a look.”

And ignoring the large OUT OF ORDER sign, she

opened the door.

It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry

had ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and

spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. The floor

was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the

stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders;

 

the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and

scratched and one of them was dangling off its

hinges.

Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off

toward the end stall. When she reached it she said,

“Hello, Myrtle, how are you?”

Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was

floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on

her chin.

“This is a girls’ bathroom,” she said, eyeing Ron and

Harry suspiciously. “They’re not girls.”

“No,” Hermione agreed. “I just wanted to show them

how — er — nice it is in here.”

She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the

damp floor.

“Ask her if she saw anything,” Harry mouthed at

Hermione.

“What are you whispering?” said Myrtle, staring at

him.

“Nothing,” said Harry quickly. “We wanted to ask — ”

“I wish people would stop talking behind my back!”

said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. “I do have

feelings, you know, even if I am dead — ”

“Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,” said Hermione.

“Harry only — ”

“No one wants to upset me! That’s a good one!”

howled Myrtle. “My life was nothing but misery at this

place and now people come along ruining my death!”

 

“We wanted to ask you if you’ve seen anything funny

lately,” said Hermione quickly. “Because a cat was

attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.”

“Did you see anyone near here that night?” said

Harry.

“I wasn’t paying attention,” said Myrtle dramatically.

“Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to

kill myself. Then, of course, I remembered that I’m —

that I’m — ”

“Already dead,” said Ron helpfully.

Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned

over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing

water all over them and vanishing from sight,

although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she

had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.

Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but

Hermione shrugged wearily and said, “Honestly, that

was almost cheerful for Myrtle. ... Come on, let’s go.”

Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle’s gurgling

sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump.

“RON!”

Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the

stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of

complete shock on his face.

“That’s a girls’ bathroom!” he gasped. “What were you

— ?”

“Just having a look around,” Ron shrugged. “Clues,

you know — ”

 

Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry

forcefully of Mrs. Weasley.

“Get — away — from — there — ” Percy said, striding

toward them and starting to bustle them along,

flapping his arms. “Don’t you care what this looks

like? Coming back here while everyone’s at dinner — ”

“Why shouldn’t we be here?” said Ron hotly, stopping

short and glaring at Percy. “Listen, we never laid a

finger on that cat!”

“That’s what I told Ginny,” said Percy fiercely, “but

she still seems to think you’re going to be expelled,

I’ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you

might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly

overexcited by this business — ”

“ You don’t care about Ginny,” said Ron, whose ears

were now reddening. “You’re just worried I’m going to

mess up your chances of being Head Boy — ”

“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely,

fingering his prefect badge. “And I hope it teaches you

a lesson! No more detective work, or I’ll write to

Mum!”

And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as

Ron’s ears.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as

possible from Percy in the common room that night.

Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting

his Charms homework. When he reached absently for

his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the

parchment. Fuming almost as much as his

homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of

 

Spells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry’s surprise, Hermione

followed suit.

“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as

though continuing a conversation they had just been

having. “Who’d want to frighten all the Squibs and

Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?”

“Let’s think,” said Ron in mock puzzlement. “Who do

we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?”

He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back,

unconvinced.

“If you’re talking about Malfoy — ”

“Of course I am!” said Ron. “You heard him — ‘You’ll

be next, MudbloodsV — come on, you’ve only got to

look at his foul rat face to know it’s him — ”

“Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?” said Hermione

skeptically.

“Look at his family,” said Harry, closing his books,

too. “The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin;

he’s always boasting about it. They could easily be

Slytherin’s descendants. His father’s definitely evil

enough.”

“They could’ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets

for centuries!” said Ron. “Handing it down, father to

son. ...”

“Well,” said Hermione cautiously, “I suppose it’s

possible. ...”

“But how do we prove it?” said Harry darkly.

 

“There might be a way,” said Hermione slowly,

dropping her voice still further with a quick glance

across the room at Percy. “Of course, it would be

difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We’d be

breaking about fifty school rules, I expect — ”

“If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will

let us know, won’t you?” said Ron irritably.

“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to

do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and

ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it’s

us.”

“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.

“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be

some Polyjuice Potion.”

“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.

“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — ”

“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions

than listen to Snape?” muttered Ron.

“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it!

We could change into three of the Slytherins. No one

would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us

anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the

Slytherin common room right now, if only we could

hear him.”

“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said

Ron, frowning. “What if we were stuck looking like

three of the Slytherins forever?”

“It wears off after a while,” said Hermione, waving her

hand impatiently. “But getting hold of the recipe will

 

be very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called

Moste Potente Potions and it’s bound to be in the

Restricted Section of the library.”

There was only one way to get out a book from the

Restricted Section: You needed a signed note of

permission from a teacher.

“Hard to see why we’d want the book, really,” said

Ron, “if we weren’t going to try and make one of the

potions.”

“I think,” said Hermione, “that if we made it sound as

though we were just interested in the theory, we

might stand a chance. ...”

“Oh, come on, no teacher’s going to fall for that,” said

Ron. “They’d have to be really thick. ...”

THE ROGUE BLUDGER

Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor

Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class.

Instead, he read passages from his books to them,

and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic

bits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these

reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play

a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had

cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold,

and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything

except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.

Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their

very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this

time acting a werewolf. If he hadn’t had a very good

reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would

have refused to do it.

“Nice loud howl, Harry — exactly — and then, if you’ll

believe it, I pounced — like this — slammed him to

the floor — thus — with one hand, I managed to hold

him down — with my other, I put my wand to his

throat — I then screwed up my remaining strength

 

and performed the immensely complex Homorphus

Charm — he let out a piteous moan — go on, Harry —

higher than that — good — the fur vanished — the

fangs shrank — and he turned back into a man.

Simple, yet effective — and another village will

remember me forever as the hero who delivered them

from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.”

The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.

“Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of

the Wagga Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical

Me to the author of the best one!”

The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back

of the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting.

“Ready?” Harry muttered.

“Wait till everyone’s gone,” said Hermione nervously.

“All right ...”

She approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper

clutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right

behind her.

“Er — Professor Lockhart?” Hermione stammered. “I

wanted to — to get this book out of the library. Just

for background reading.” She held out the piece of

paper, her hand shaking slightly. “But the thing is,

it’s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a

teacher to sign for it — I’m sure it would help me

understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls

about slow-acting venoms — ”

“Ah, Gadding with GhoulsV’ said Lockhart, taking the

note from Hermione and smiling widely at her.

“Possibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?”

 

“Oh, yes,” said Hermione eagerly. “So clever, the way

you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer — ”

“Well, I’m sure no one will mind me giving the best

student of the year a little extra help,” said Lockhart

warmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock

quill. “Yes, nice, isn’t it?” he said, misreading the

revolted look on Ron’s face. “I usually save it for book

signings.”

He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note

and handed it back to Hermione.

“So, Harry,” said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the

note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag.

“Tomorrow’s the first Quidditch match of the season, I

believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear

you’re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was

asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to

dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces.

Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private

training, don’t hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass

on my expertise to less able players. ...”

Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then

hurried off after Ron and Hermione.

“I don’t believe it,” he said as the three of them

examined the signature on the note. “He didn’t even

look at the book we wanted.”

“That’s because he’s a brainless git,” said Ron. “But

who cares, we’ve got what we needed — ”

“He is not a brainless git,” said Hermione shrilly as

they half ran toward the library.

“Just because he said you were the best student of

the year — ”

 

They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled

stillness of the library. Madam Pince, the librarian,

was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an

underfed vulture.

“Moste Potente Potions?” she repeated suspiciously,

trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione

wouldn’t let go.

“I was wondering if I could keep it,” she said

breathlessly.

“Oh, come on,” said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp

and thrusting it at Madam Pince. “We’ll get you

another autograph. Lockhart ’ll sign anything if it

stands still long enough.”

Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though

determined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test.

She stalked away between the lofty shelves and

returned several minutes later carrying a large and

moldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into

her bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or

look too guilty.

Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning

Myrtle’s out-of-order bathroom once again. Hermione

had overridden Ron’s objections by pointing out that

it was the last place anyone in their right minds

would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy.

Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but

they were ignoring her, and she them.

Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and

the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages.

It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the

Restricted Section. Some of the potions had effects

almost too gruesome to think about, and there were

some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a

 

man who seemed to have been turned inside out and

a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of

her head.

“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the

page headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated

with drawings of people halfway through transforming

into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist

had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces.

“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,”

said Hermione as they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing

flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,” she

murmured, running her finger down the list of

ingredients. “Well, they’re easy enough, they’re in the

student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves. ...

Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn — don’t know

where we’re going to get that — shredded skin of a

boomslang — thatll be tricky, too — and of course a

bit of whoever we want to change into.”

“Excuse me?” said Ron sharply. “What d’you mean, a

bit of whoever we’re changing into? I’m drinking

nothing with Crabbe’s toenails in it — ”

Hermione continued as though she hadn’t heard him.

“We don’t have to worry about that yet, though,

because we add those bits last. ...”

Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another

worry.

“D’you realize how much we’re going to have to steal,

Hermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that’s

definitely not in the students’ cupboard. What’re we

going to do, break into Snape’s private stores? I don’t

know if this is a good idea. ...”

 

Hermione shut the book with a snap.

“Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,” she

said. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks

and her eyes were brighter than usual. “ I don’t want

to break rules, you know. / think threatening Muggle-

borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion.

But if you don’t want to find out if it’s Malfoy, I’ll go

straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back

in — ”

“I never thought I’d see the day when you’d be

persuading us to break rules,” said Ron. “All right,

we’ll do it. But not toenails, okay?”

“How long will it take to make, anyway?” said Harry

as Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again.

“Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the

full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for

twenty-one days ... I’d say it’d be ready in about a

month, if we can get all the ingredients.”

“A month?” said Ron. “Malfoy could have attacked

half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!” But

Hermione ’s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he

added swiftly, “But it’s the best plan we’ve got, so full

steam ahead, I say.”

However, while Hermione was checking that the coast

was clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron

muttered to Harry, “It’ll be a lot less hassle if you can

just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.”

Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a

while thinking about the coming Quidditch match. He

was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood

would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of

facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms

 

gold could buy. He had never wanted to beat

Slytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there

with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and

went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest

of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty

table, all looking uptight and not speaking much.

As eleven o’clock approached, the whole school

started to make its way down to the Quidditch

stadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of

thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying

over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker

rooms. The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor

robes, then sat down to listen to Wood’s usual pre-

match pep talk.

“Slytherin has better brooms than us,” he began. “No

point denying it. But we’ve got better people on our

brooms. We’ve trained harder than they have, we’ve

been flying in all weathers — ” (“Too true,” muttered

George Weasley. “I haven’t been properly dry since

August”) “ — and we’re going to make them rue the

day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his

way onto their team.”

Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.

“It’ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a

Seeker has to have something more than a rich

father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying,

Harry, because we’ve got to win today, we’ve got to.”

“So no pressure, Harry,” said Fred, winking at him.

As they walked out onto the field, a roar of noise

greeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and

Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but

the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and

hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch

 

teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which

they did, giving each other threatening stares and

gripping rather harder than was necessary.

“On my whistle,” said Madam Hooch. “Three ... two ...

one ...”

With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward,

the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky.

Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around

for the Snitch.

“All right there, Scarhead?” yelled Malfoy, shooting

underneath him as though to show off the speed of

his broom.

Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a

heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he

avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as

it passed.

“Close one, Harry!” said George, streaking past him

with his club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger

back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw George give the

Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian

Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair

and shot straight for Harry again.

Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George

managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once again, the

Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry’s

head.

Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the

other end of the field. He could hear the Bludger

whistling along behind him. What was going on?

Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it

was their job to try and unseat as many people as

possible. ...

 

Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other

end. Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with

all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course.

“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as

though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the

Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was

forced to fly off at full speed.

It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto

his face, splattering onto his glasses. He didn’t have a

clue what was going on in the rest of the game until

he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say,

“Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero — ”

The Slytherins’ superior brooms were clearly doing

their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing

all it could to knock Harry out of the air. Fred and

George were now flying so close to him on either side

that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing

arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let

alone catch it.

“Someone’s — tampered — with — this — Bludger — ”

Fred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it

as it launched a new attack on Harry.

“We need time out,” said George, trying to signal to

Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry’s nose at

the same time.

Wood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch’s

whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived

for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger.

“What’s going on?” said Wood as the Gryffindor team

huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd

jeered. “We’re being flattened. Fred, George, where

 

were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina

scoring?”

“We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other

Bludger from murdering Harry, Oliver,” said George

angrily. “Someone’s fixed it — it won’t leave Harry

alone. It hasn’t gone for anyone else all game. The

Slytherins must have done something to it.”

“But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam

Hooch’s office since our last practice, and there was

nothing wrong with them then. ...” said Wood,

anxiously.

Madam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her

shoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering

and pointing in his direction.

“Listen,” said Harry as she came nearer and nearer,

“with you two flying around me all the time the only

way I’m going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my

sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal

with the rogue one.”

“Don’t be thick,” said Fred. “It’ll take your head off.”

Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.

“Oliver, this is insane,” said Alicia Spinnet angrily.

“You can’t let Harry deal with that thing on his own.

Let’s ask for an inquiry — ”

“If we stop now, we’ll have to forfeit the match!” said

Harry. “And we’re not losing to Slytherin just because

of a crazy Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave

me alone!”

 

“This is all your fault,” George said angrily to Wood. “

‘Get the Snitch or die trying,’ what a stupid thing to

tell him—”

Madam Hooch had joined them.

“Ready to resume play?” she asked Wood.

Wood looked at the determined look on Harry’s face.

“All right,” he said. “Fred, George, you heard Harry —

leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on

his own.”

The rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam

Hooch’s whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and

heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him.

Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and

swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly

dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain

was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as

he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive

from the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the

crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the

rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change

direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind

of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium,

squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the

Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying

to get past Wood —

A whistling in Harry’s ear told him the Bludger had

just missed him again; he turned right over and sped

in the opposite direction.

“Training for the ballet, Potter?” yelled Malfoy as

Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair

to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing

a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at

 

Malfoy in hatred, he saw it — the Golden Snitch. It

was hovering inches above Malfoy’s left ear — and

Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn’t seen it.

For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not

daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up

and saw the Snitch.

WHAM.

He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger

had hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and

Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by the searing

pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-

drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his

right arm dangling useless at his side — the Bludger

came pelting back for a second attack, this time

aiming at his face — Harry swerved out of the way,

one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to

Malfoy.

Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the

shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes

widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking

him.

“What the — ” he gasped, careening out of Harry’s

way.

Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and

made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the

cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with

his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as

he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to

pass out.

With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off

his broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange

angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a

 

distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He

focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.

“Aha,” he said vaguely. “We’ve won.”

And he fainted.

He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on

the field, with someone leaning over him. He saw a

glitter of teeth.

“Oh, no, not you,” he moaned.

“Doesn’t know what he’s saying,” said Lockhart loudly

to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around

them. “Not to worry, Harry. I’m about to fix your

arm.”

“iVo!” said Harry. “I’ll keep it like this, thanks. ...”

He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard

a familiar clicking noise nearby.

“I don’t want a photo of this, Colin,” he said loudly.

“Lie back, Harry,” said Lockhart soothingly. “It’s a

simple charm I’ve used countless times — ”

“Why can’t I just go to the hospital wing?” said Harry

through clenched teeth.

“He should really, Professor,” said a muddy Wood,

who couldn’t help grinning even though his Seeker

was injured. “Great capture, Harry, really

spectacular, your best yet, I’d say — ”

Through the thicket of legs around him, Harry

spotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue

 

Bludger into a box. It was still putting up a terrific

fight.

“Stand back,” said Lockhart, who was rolling up his

jade-green sleeves.

“No — don’t — ” said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was

twirling his wand and a second later had directed it

straight at Harry’s arm.

A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry’s

shoulder and spread all the way down to his

fingertips. It felt as though his arm was being

deflated. He didn’t dare look at what was happening.

He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his

arm, but his worst fears were realized as the people

above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking

away madly. His arm didn’t hurt anymore — nor did

it feel remotely like an arm.

“Ah,” said Lockhart. “Yes. Well, that can sometimes

happen. But the point is, the bones are no longer

broken. That’s the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry,

just toddle up to the hospital wing — ah, Mr.

Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? — and

Madam Pomfrey will be able to — er — tidy you up a

bit.”

As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided.

Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right

side. What he saw nearly made him pass out again.

Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked

like a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove. He tried to

move his fingers. Nothing happened.

Lockhart hadn’t mended Harry’s bones. He had

removed them.

 

Madam Pomfrey wasn’t at all pleased.

“You should have come straight to me!” she raged,

holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an

hour before, had been a working arm. “I can mend

bones in a second — but growing them back — ”

“You will be able to, won’t you?” said Harry

desperately.

“I’ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,” said

Madam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of

pajamas. “You’ll have to stay the night. ...”

Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around

Harry’s bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas. It

took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a

sleeve.

“How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione,

eh?” Ron called through the curtain as he pulled

Harry’s limp fingers through the cuff. “If Harry had

wanted deboning he would have asked.”

“Anyone can make a mistake,” said Hermione. “And it

doesn’t hurt anymore, does it, Harry?”

“No,” said Harry, getting into bed. “But it doesn’t do

anything else either.”

As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped

pointlessly.

Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the

curtain. Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of

something labeled Skele-Gro.

 

“You’re in for a rough night,” she said, pouring out a

steaming beakerful and handing it to him. “Regrowing

bones is a nasty business.”

So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry’s mouth

and throat as it went down, making him cough and

splutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and

inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron

and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water.

“We won, though,” said Ron, a grin breaking across

his face. “That was some catch you made. Malfoy’s

face ... he looked ready to kill. ...”

“I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,” said

Hermione darkly.

“We can add that to the list of questions we’ll ask him

when we’ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,” said Harry,

sinking back onto his pillows. “I hope it tastes better

than this stuff. ...”

“If it’s got bits of Slytherins in it? You’ve got to be

joking,” said Ron.

The door of the hospital wing burst open at that

moment. Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the

Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry.

“Unbelievable flying, Harry,” said George. “I’ve just

seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about

having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing.

Malfoy didn’t seem too happy.”

They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of

pumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry’s bed and

were just getting started on what promised to be a

good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over,

 

shouting, “This boy needs rest, he’s got thirty- three

bones to regrow! Out! OUT!”

And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him

from the stabbing pains in his limp arm.

Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in

the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His

arm now felt full of large splinters. For a second, he

thought that was what had woken him. Then, with a

thrill of horror, he realized that someone was

sponging his forehead in the dark.

“Get off!” he said loudly, and then, “Dobby\”

The house-elf’s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering

at Harry through the darkness. A single tear was

running down his long, pointed nose.

“Harry Potter came back to school,” he whispered

miserably. “Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter.

Ah sir, why didn’t you heed Dobby? Why didn’t Harry

Potter go back home when he missed the train?”

Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed

Dobby’s sponge away.

“What’re you doing here?” he said. “And how did you

know I missed the train?”

Dobby’s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a

sudden suspicion.

“It was you!” he said slowly. “You stopped the barrier

from letting us through!”

“Indeed yes, sir,” said Dobby, nodding his head

vigorously, ears flapping. “Dobby hid and watched for

Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had

 

to iron his hands afterward” — he showed Harry ten

long, bandaged fingers — “but Dobby didn’t care, sir,

for he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did

Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school

another way!”

He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his

ugly head.

“Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter

was back at Hogwarts, he let his master’s dinner

burn! Such a flogging Dobby never had, sir. ...”

Harry slumped back onto his pillows.

“You nearly got Ron and me expelled,” he said

fiercely. “You’d better get lost before my bones come

back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.”

Dobby smiled weakly.

“Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them

five times a day at home.”

He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase

he wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger

ebb away in spite of himself.

“Why d’you wear that thing, Dobby?” he asked

curiously.

“This, sir?” said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. “

Tis a mark of the house-elf’s enslavement, sir. Dobby

can only be freed if his masters present him with

clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby

even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave

their house forever.”

 

Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly,

“Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his

Bludger would be enough to make — ”

“Your Bludger?” said Harry, anger rising once more.

“What d’you mean, your Bludger? You made that

Bludger try and kill me?”

“Not kill you, sir, never kill you!” said Dobby,

shocked. “Dobby wants to save Harry Potter’s life!

Better sent home, grievously injured, than remain

here, sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt

enough to be sent home!”

“Oh, is that all?” said Harry angrily. “I don’t suppose

you’re going to tell me why you wanted me sent home

in pieces?”

“Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!” Dobby groaned, more

tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase. “If he knew

what he means to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we

dregs of the magical world! Dobby remembers how it

was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the

height of his powers, sir! We house-elves were treated

like vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like

that, sir,” he admitted, drying his face on the

pillowcase. “But mostly, sir, life has improved for my

kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-

Named. Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord’s

power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and

Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of

us who thought the Dark days would never end, sir.

... And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to

happen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby

cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is

to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is

open once more — ”

 

Dobby froze, horrors truck, then grabbed Harry’s

water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over

his own head, toppling out of sight. A second later, he

crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering,

“Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby ...”

“So there is a Chamber of Secrets?” Harry whispered.

“And — did you say it’s been opened before ? Tell me,

Dobby!”

He seized the elf’s bony wrist as Dobby’s hand inched

toward the water jug. “But I’m not Muggle-born —

how can I be in danger from the Chamber?”

“Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,”

stammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. “Dark

deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter

must not be here when they happen — go home,

Harry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle

in this, sir, ’tis too dangerous — ”

“Who is it, Dobby?” Harry said, keeping a firm hold on

Dobby’s wrist to stop him from hitting himself with

the water jug again. “Who’s opened it? Who opened it

last time?”

“Dobby can’t, sir, Dobby can’t, Dobby mustn’t tell!”

squealed the elf. “Go home, Harry Potter, go home!”

“I’m not going anywhere!” said Harry fiercely. “One of

my best friends is Muggle-born; she’ll be first in line if

the Chamber really has been opened — ”

“Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!”

moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy. “So

noble! So valiant! But he must save himself, he must,

Harry Potter must not — ”

 

Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry

heard it, too. There were footsteps coming down the

passageway outside.

“Dobby must go!” breathed the elf, terrified. There

was a loud crack, and Harry’s fist was suddenly

clenched on thin air. He slumped back into bed, his

eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the

footsteps drew nearer.

Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the

dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a

nightcap. He was carrying one end of what looked like

a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second

later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a

bed.

“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered Dumbledore, and

Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry’s

bed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be

asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then Professor

McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by

Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over

her nightdress. He heard a sharp intake of breath.

“What happened?” Madam Pomfrey whispered to

Dumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed.

“Another attack,” said Dumbledore. “Minerva found

him on the stairs.”

“There was a bunch of grapes next to him,” said

Professor McGonagall. “We think he was trying to

sneak up here to visit Potter.”

Harry’s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and

carefully, he raised himself a few inches so he could

look at the statue on the bed. A ray of moonlight lay

across its staring face.

 

It was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his

hands were stuck up in front of him, holding his

camera.

“Petrified?” whispered Madam Pomfrey.

“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “But I shudder to

think ... If Albus hadn’t been on the way downstairs

for hot chocolate — who knows what might have — ”

The three of them stared down at Colin. Then

Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the

camera out of Colin’s rigid grip.

“You don’t think he managed to get a picture of his

attacker?” said Professor McGonagall eagerly.

Dumbledore didn’t answer. He opened the back of the

camera.

“Good gracious!” said Madam Pomfrey.

A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry,

three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt

plastic.

“Melted,” said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. “All

melted ...”

“What does this mean, Albus?” Professor McGonagall

asked urgently.

“It means,” said Dumbledore, “that the Chamber of

Secrets is indeed open again.”

Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth.

Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore.

“But, Albus ... surely ... who?”

 

“The question is not who,” said Dumbledore, his eyes

on Colin. “The question is, how. ...”

And from what Harry could see of Professor

McGonagall’s shadowy face, she didn’t understand

this any better than he did.

 

THE DUELING CLUB

Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the

dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm

reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked

over at Colin’s bed, but it had been blocked from view

by the high curtains Harry had changed behind

yesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey

came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then

began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.

“All in order,” she said as he clumsily fed himself

porridge left-handed. “When you’ve finished eating,

you may leave.”

Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off

to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and

Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren’t

there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where

they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that

they weren’t interested in whether he had his bones

back or not.

 

As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled

out of it, looking in far better spirits than last time

they’d met.

“Oh, hello, Harry,” he said. “Excellent flying

yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken

the lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty points!”

“You haven’t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?” said

Harry.

“No, I haven’t,” said Percy, his smile fading. “I hope

Ron’s not in another girls’ toilet ...”

Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight,

and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle’s

bathroom. He couldn’t see why Ron and Hermione

would be in there again, but after making sure that

neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened

the door and heard their voices coming from a locked

stall.

“It’s me,” he said, closing the door behind him. There

was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the

stall and he saw Hermione ’s eye peering through the

keyhole.

“Harry\” she said. “You gave us such a fright — come

in — how’s your arm?”

“Fine,” said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old

cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling

from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire

beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires

was a speciality of Hermione ’s.

“We ’d’ve come to meet you, but we decided to get

started on the Polyjuice Potion,” Ron explained as

 

Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. “We’ve

decided this is the safest place to hide it.”

Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione

interrupted.

“We already know — we heard Professor McGonagall

telling Professor Flitwick this morning. That’s why we

decided we’d better get going — ”

“The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the

better,” snarled Ron. “D’you know what I think? He

was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match,

he took it out on Colin.”

“There’s something else,” said Harry, watching

Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing

them into the potion. “Dobby came to visit me in the

middle of the night.”

Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told

them everything Dobby had told him — or hadn’t told

him. Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths

open.

“The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?”

Hermione said.

“This settles it,” said Ron in a triumphant voice.

“Lucius Malfoy must’ve opened the Chamber when he

was at school here and now he’s told dear old Draco

how to do it. It’s obvious. Wish Dobby ’d told you what

kind of monster’s in there, though. I want to know

how come nobody’s noticed it sneaking around the

school.”

“Maybe it can make itself invisible,” said Hermione,

prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. “Or

maybe it can disguise itself — pretend to be a suit of

 

armor or something — I’ve read about Chameleon

Ghouls — ”

“You read too much, Hermione,” said Ron, pouring

dead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up

the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry.

“So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and

broke your arm. ...” He shook his head. “You know

what, Harry? If he doesn’t stop trying to save your life

he’s going to kill you.”

k k k

The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and

was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing

had spread through the entire school by Monday

morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and

suspicion. The first years were now moving around

the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they

would be attacked if they ventured forth alone.

Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in

Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and

George were going the wrong way about cheering her

up. They were taking turns covering themselves with

fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind

statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic

with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs.

Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.

Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade

in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices

was sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought

a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple

crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other

Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger;

 

he was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be

attacked.

“They went for Filch first,” Neville said, his round face

fearful. “And everyone knows I’m almost a Squib.”

In the second week of December Professor

McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names

of those who would be staying at school for

Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list;

they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck

them as very suspicious. The holidays would be the

perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to

worm a confession out of him.

Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They

still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin,

and the only place they were going to get them was

from Snape’s private stores. Harry privately felt he’d

rather face Slytherin’s legendary monster than let

Snape catch him robbing his office.

“What we need,” said Hermione briskly as Thursday

afternoon’s double Potions lesson loomed nearer, “is a

diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape’s

office and take what we need.”

Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.

“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione

continued in a matter-of-fact tone. “You two will be

expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I’ve got

a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough

mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.”

Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in

Snape’s Potions class was about as safe as poking a

sleeping dragon in the eye.

 

Potions lessons took place in one of the large

dungeons. Thursday afternoon’s lesson proceeded in

the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming

between the wooden desks, on which stood brass

scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through

the fumes, making waspish remarks about the

Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered

appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape’s

favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron

and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they

would get detention faster than you could say

“Unfair.”

Harry’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he

had his mind on more important things. He was

waiting for Hermione’s signal, and he hardly listened

as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion. When

Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville,

Hermione caught Harry’s eye and nodded.

Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron,

pulled one of Fred’s Filibuster fireworks out of his

pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The

firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had

only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and

lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in

Goyle’s cauldron.

Goyle’s potion exploded, showering the whole class.

People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution

hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to

swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his

hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size

of a dinner plate — Snape was trying to restore calm

and find out what had happened. Through the

confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into

Snape’s office.

 

“Silence! SILENCE!” Snape roared. “Anyone who has

been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draught —

when I find out who did this — ”

Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry

forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose

like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to

Snape ’s desk, some weighted down with arms like

clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed-

up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the

dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.

When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the

various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to

Goyle’s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black

remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.

“If I ever find out who threw this,” Snape whispered, “I

shall make sure that person is expelled.”

Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a

puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him,

and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not

have been more welcome.

“He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as

they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. “I

could tell.”

Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron

and began to stir feverishly.

“It’ll be ready in two weeks,” she said happily.

“Snape can’t prove it was you,” said Ron reassuringly

to Harry. “What can he do?”

“Knowing Snape, something foul,” said Harry as the

potion frothed and bubbled.

 

A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking

across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot

of people gathered around the notice board, reading a

piece of parchment that had just been pinned up.

Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them

over, looking excited.

“They’re starting a Dueling Club!” said Seamus. “First

meeting tonight! I wouldn’t mind dueling lessons;

they might come in handy one of these days. ...”

“What, you reckon Slytherin’s monster can duel?”

said Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest.

“Could be useful,” he said to Harry and Hermione as

they went into dinner. “Shall we go?”

Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o’clock

that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The

long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage

had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of

candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety

black once more and most of the school seemed to be

packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and

looking excited.

“I wonder who’ll be teaching us?” said Hermione as

they edged into the chattering crowd. “Someone told

me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was

young — maybe it’ll be him.”

“As long as it’s not — ” Harry began, but he ended on

a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the

stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and

accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his

usual black.

 

Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called,

“Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me?

Can you all hear me? Excellent!

“Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me

permission to start this little dueling club, to train

you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I

myself have done on countless occasions — for full

details, see my published works.

“Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,”

said Lockhart, flashing a wide smile. “He tells me he

knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has

sportingly agreed to help me with a short

demonstration before we begin. Now, I don’t want any

of you youngsters to worry — you’ll still have your

Potions master when I’m through with him, never

fear!”

“Wouldn’t it be good if they finished each other off?”

Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.

Snape ’s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why

Lockhart was still smiling; if Snape had been looking

at him like that he’d have been running as fast as he

could in the opposite direction.

Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and

bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of

his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably.

Then they raised their wands like swords in front of

them.

“As you see, we are holding our wands in the

accepted combative position,” Lockhart told the silent

crowd. “On the count of three, we will cast our first

spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.”

 

“I wouldn’t bet on that,” Harry murmured, watching

Snape baring his teeth.

“One — two — three — ”

Both of them swung their wands above their heads

and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried:

“ ExpelliarmusV’ There was a dazzling flash of scarlet

light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew

backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and

slid down it to sprawl on the floor.

Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered.

Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. “Do you think he’s

all right?” she squealed through her fingers.

“Who cares?” said Harry and Ron together.

Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat

had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end.

“Well, there you have it!” he said, tottering back onto

the platform. “That was a Disarming Charm — as you

see, I’ve lost my wand — ah, thank you, Miss Brown

— yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor

Snape, but if you don’t mind my saying so, it was very

obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to

stop you it would have been only too easy — however,

I felt it would be instructive to let them see ...”

Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had

noticed, because he said, “Enough demonstrating! I’m

going to come amongst you now and put you all into

pairs. Professor Snape, if you’d like to help me — ”

They moved through the crowd, matching up

partners. Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-

Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first.

 

“Time to split up the dream team, I think,” he

sneered. “Weasley, you can partner Finnigan. Potter

Harry moved automatically toward Hermione.

“I don’t think so,” said Snape, smiling coldly. “Mr.

Malfoy, come over here. Let’s see what you make of

the famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger — you can

partner Miss Bulstrode.”

Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a

Slytherin girl who reminded Harry of a picture he’d

seen in Holidays with Hags. She was large and square

and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave

her a weak smile that she did not return.

“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the

platform. “And bow!”

Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not

taking their eyes off each other.

“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I

count to three, cast your charms to disarm your

opponents — only to disarm them — we don’t want

any accidents — one . . . two . . . three — ”

Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already

started on “two”: His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as

though he’d been hit over the head with a saucepan.

He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be

working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his

wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, “Rictusempral”

A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he

doubled up, wheezing.

 

“I said disarm only\” Lockhart shouted in alarm over

the heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his

knees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and

he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back,

with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch

Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a

mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand

at Harry’s knees, choked, “Tarantallegral” and the

next second Harry’s legs began to jerk around out of

his control in a kind of quickstep.

“Stop! Stop!” screamed Lockhart, but Snape took

charge.

“Finite Incantatem\” he shouted; Harry’s feet stopped

dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able

to look up.

A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the

scene. Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor,

panting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus,

apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done;

but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still

moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and

Hermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands

lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt forward and

pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot

bigger than he was.

“Dear, dear,” said Lockhart, skittering through the

crowd, looking at the aftermath of the duels. “Up you

go, Macmillan. ... Careful there, Miss Fawcett. ...

Pinch it hard, it’ll stop bleeding in a second, Boot —

“I think I’d better teach you how to block unfriendly

spells,” said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst

of the hall. He glanced at Snape, whose black eyes

glinted, and looked quickly away. “Let’s have a

 

volunteer pair — Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley,

how about you — ”

“A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,” said Snape, gliding

over like a large and malevolent bat. “Longbottom

causes devastation with the simplest spells. We’ll be

sending what’s left of Finch-Fletchley up to the

hospital wing in a matchbox.” Neville’s round, pink

face went pinker. “How about Malfoy and Potter?”

said Snape with a twisted smile.

“Excellent idea!” said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and

Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed

away to give them room.

“Now, Harry,” said Lockhart. “When Draco points his

wand at you, you do this.”

He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated

sort of wiggling action, and dropped it. Snape smirked

as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, “Whoops —

my wand is a little overexcited — ”

Snape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and

whispered something in his ear. Malfoy smirked, too.

Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said,

“Professor, could you show me that blocking thing

again?”

“Scared?” muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn’t

hear him.

“You wish,” said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.

Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. “Just

do what I did, Harry!”

“What, drop my wand?”

 

But Lockhart wasn’t listening.

“Three — two — one — go!” he shouted.

Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed,

“ Serpensortial”

The end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast,

as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto

the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to

strike. There were screams as the crowd backed

swiftly away, clearing the floor.

“Don’t move, Potter,” said Snape lazily, clearly

enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye

to eye with the angry snake. “I’ll get rid of it. ...”

“Allow me!” shouted Lockhart. He brandished his

wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the

snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air

and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged,

hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin

Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed,

poised to strike.

Harry wasn’t sure what made him do it. He wasn’t

even aware of deciding to do it. All he knew was that

his legs were carrying him forward as though he was

on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the

snake, “Leave him alone!” And miraculously —

inexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor, docile

as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry.

Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the

snake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how he

knew it, he couldn’t have explained.

He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see

Justin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful —

but certainly not angry and scared.

 

“What do you think you’re playing at?” he shouted,

and before Harry could say anything, Justin had

turned and stormed out of the hall.

Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the

snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke.

Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected

way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry

didn’t like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous

muttering all around the walls. Then he felt a tugging

on the back of his robes.

“Come on,” said Ron’s voice in his ear. “Move — come

on—”

Ron steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying

alongside them. As they went through the doors, the

people on either side drew away as though they were

frightened of catching something. Harry didn’t have a

clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor

Hermione explained anything until they had dragged

him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common

room. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and

said, “You’re a Parselmouth. Why didn’t you tell us?”

“I’m a what?” said Harry.

“A Parselmouth .!” said Ron. “You can talk to snakes!”

“I know,” said Harry. “I mean, that’s only the second

time I’ve ever done it. I accidentally set a boa

constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once —

long story — but it was telling me it had never seen

Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to —

that was before I knew I was a wizard — ”

“A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?”

Ron repeated faintly.

 

“So?” said Harry. “I bet loads of people here can do it.”

“Oh, no they can’t,” said Ron. “It’s not a very common

gift. Harry, this is bad.”

“What’s bad?” said Harry, starting to feel quite angry.

“What’s wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn’t told

that snake not to attack Justin — ”

“Oh, that’s what you said to it?”

“What d’you mean? You were there — you heard me

“I heard you speaking Parseltongue,” said Ron.

“Snake language. You could have been saying

anything — no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded

like you were egging the snake on or something — it

was creepy, you know — ”

Harry gaped at him.

“I spoke a different language? But — I didn’t realize —

how can I speak a language without knowing I can

speak it?”

Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were

looking as though someone had died. Harry couldn’t

see what was so terrible.

“D’you want to tell me what’s wrong with stopping a

massive snake biting off Justin’s head?” he said.

“What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin

doesn’t have to join the Headless Hunt?”

“It matters,” said Hermione, speaking at last in a

hushed voice, “because being able to talk to snakes

was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That’s

why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.”

 

Harry’s mouth fell open.

“Exactly,” said Ron. “And now the whole school’s

going to think you’re his great-great-great-great-

grandson or something — ”

“But I’m not,” said Harry, with a panic he couldn’t

quite explain.

“You’ll find that hard to prove,” said Hermione. “He

lived about a thousand years ago; for all we know,

you could be.”

•k k k

Harry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap

in the curtains around his four-poster he watched

snow starting to drift past the tower window and

wondered ...

Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin? He

didn’t know anything about his father’s family, after

all. The Dursleys had always forbidden questions

about his wizarding relatives.

Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue.

The words wouldn’t come. It seemed he had to be

face-to-face with a snake to do it.

But I’m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat

wouldn’t have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood.

Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the

Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don’t you

remember?

Harry turned over. He’d see Justin the next day in

Herbology and he’d explain that he’d been calling the

 

snake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily,

pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.

By next morning, however, the snow that had begun

in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that

the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled:

Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on

the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust

to no one else, now that it was so important for the

Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and

Colin Creevey.

Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the

Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione

used their time off to play a game of wizard chess.

“For heaven’s sake, Harry,” said Hermione,

exasperated, as one of Ron’s bishops wrestled her

knight off his horse and dragged him off the board.

“Go and find Justin if it’s so important to you.”

So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole,

wondering where Justin might be.

The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime

because of the thick, swirling gray snow at every

window. Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms

where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of

what was happening within. Professor McGonagall

was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had

turned his friend into a badger. Resisting the urge to

take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin

might be using his free time to catch up on some

work, and deciding to check the library first.

A group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in

Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the

library, but they didn’t seem to be working. Between

the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see

 

that their heads were close together and they were

having what looked like an absorbing conversation.

He couldn’t see whether Justin was among them. He

was walking toward them when something of what

they were saying met his ears, and he paused to

listen, hidden in the Invisibility section.

“So anyway,” a stout boy was saying, “I told Justin to

hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter’s

marked him down as his next victim, it’s best if he

keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin’s

been waiting for something like this to happen ever

since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. Justin

actually told him he’d been down for Eton. That’s not

the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin’s

heir on the loose, is it?”

“You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?” said a

girl with blonde pigtails anxiously.

“Hannah,” said the stout boy solemnly, “he’s a

Parselmouth. Everyone knows that’s the mark of a

Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one

who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin

himself Serpent-tongue.”

There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie

went on, “Remember what was written on the wall?

Enemies of the Heir, Beware. Potter had some sort of

run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch ’s cat’s

attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying

Potter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him

while he was lying in the mud. Next thing we know —

Creevey ’s been attacked.”

“He always seems so nice, though,” said Hannah

uncertainly, “and, well, he’s the one who made You-

Know-Who disappear. He can’t be all bad, can he?”

 

Ernie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs

bent closer, and Harry edged nearer so that he could

catch Ernie’s words.

“No one knows how he survived that attack by You-

Know-Who. I mean to say, he was only a baby when it

happened. He should have been blasted into

smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard

could have survived a curse like that.” He dropped his

voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and

said, “ That’s probably why You-Know-Who wanted to

kill him in the first place. Didn’t want another Dark

Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers

Potter’s been hiding?”

Harry couldn’t take anymore. Clearing his throat

loudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves.

If he hadn’t been feeling so angry, he would have

found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of

the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been

Petrified by the sight of him, and the color was

draining out of Ernie’s face.

“Hello,” said Harry. “I’m looking for Justin Finch-

Fletchley.”

The Hufflepuffs’ worst fears had clearly been

confirmed. They all looked fearfully at Ernie.

“What do you want with him?” said Ernie in a

quavering voice.

“I wanted to tell him what really happened with that

snake at the Dueling Club,” said Harry.

Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep

breath, said, “We were all there. We saw what

happened.”

 

“Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake

backed off?” said Harry.

“All I saw,” said Ernie stubbornly, though he was

trembling as he spoke, “was you speaking

Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.”

“I didn’t chase it at him!” Harry said, his voice

shaking with anger. “It didn’t even touch him!”

“It was a very near miss,” said Ernie. “And in case

you’re getting ideas,” he added hastily, “I might tell

you that you can trace my family back through nine

generations of witches and warlocks and my blood’s

as pure as anyone’s, so — ”

“I don’t care what sort of blood you’ve got!” said Harry

fiercely. “Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?”

“I’ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,” said

Ernie swiftly.

“It’s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not

hate them,” said Harry. “I’d like to see you try it.”

He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library,

earning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince,

who was polishing the gilded cover of a large

spellbook.

Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing

where he was going, he was in such a fury. The result

was that he walked into something very large and

solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.

“Oh, hello, Hagrid,” Harry said, looking up.

Hagrid’s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-

covered balaclava, but it couldn’t possibly be anyone

 

else, as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin

overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging from one of his

massive, gloved hands.

“All righ’, Harry?” he said, pulling up the balaclava so

he could speak. “Why aren’t yeh in class?”

“Canceled,” said Harry, getting up. “What’re you doing

in here?”

Hagrid held up the limp rooster.

“Second one killed this term,” he explained. “It’s

either foxes or a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, an’ I need

the headmaster’s permission ter put a charm around

the hen coop.”

He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick,

snow-flecked eyebrows.

“Yeh sure yeh’re all righ’? Yeh look all hot an’

bothered — ”

Harry couldn’t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and

the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him.

“It’s nothing,” he said. “I’d better get going, Hagrid, it’s

Transfiguration next and I’ve got to pick up my

books.”

He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had

said about him.

“Justin’s been waiting for something like this to

happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-

born. ...”

Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along

another corridor, which was particularly dark; the

 

torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft

that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He

was halfway down the passage when he tripped

headlong over something lying on the floor.

He turned to squint at what he’d fallen over and felt

as though his stomach had dissolved.

Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid

and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes

staring blankly at the ceiling. And that wasn’t all.

Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight

Harry had ever seen.

It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white

and transparent, but black and smoky, floating

immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. His

head was half off and his face wore an expression of

shock identical to Justin’s.

Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow,

his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs. He

looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and

saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could

away from the bodies. The only sounds were the

muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either

side.

He could run, and no one would ever know he had

been there. But he couldn’t just leave them lying

here. ... He had to get help. ... Would anyone believe

he hadn’t had anything to do with this?

As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him

opened with a bang. Peeves the Poltergeist came

shooting out.

 

“Why, it’s potty wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, knocking

Harry’s glasses askew as he bounced past him.

“What’s Potter up to? Why’s Potter lurking — ”

Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault.

Upside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless

Nick. He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and,

before Harry could stop him, screamed, “ATTACK!

ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR

GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

ATTAAAACK!”

Crash — crash — crash — door after door flew open

along the corridor and people flooded out. For several

long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion

that Justin was in danger of being squashed and

people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry

found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers

shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came

running, followed by her own class, one of whom still

had black-and-white- striped hair. She used her wand

to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and

ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner

had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the

Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.

“ Caught in the act!” Ernie yelled, his face stark white,

pointing his finger dramatically at Harry.

“That will do, Macmillan!” said Professor McGonagall

sharply.

Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly,

surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As

the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless

Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:

“Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,

 

You’re killing off students, you think it’s good fun — ”

“That’s enough, Peeves!” barked Professor

McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with

his tongue out at Harry.

Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by

Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the

Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know

what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end,

Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin

air, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft

Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did,

fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This

left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.

“This way, Potter,” she said.

“Professor,” said Harry at once, “I swear I didn’t — ”

“This is out of my hands, Potter,” said Professor

McGonagall curtly.

They marched in silence around a corner and she

stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone

gargoyle.

“Lemon drop!” she said. This was evidently a

password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to

life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in

two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry

couldn’t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a

spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward,

like an escalator. As he and Professor McGonagall

stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed

behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and

higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a

gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the

shape of a griffin.

 

He knew now where he was being taken. This must be

where Dumbledore lived.

 

THE POLY JUICE POTION

They stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and

Professor McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened

silently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told

Harry to wait and left him there, alone.

Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the

teachers’ offices Harry had visited so far this year,

Dumbledore’s was by far the most interesting. If he

hadn’t been scared out of his wits that he was about

to be thrown out of school, he would have been very

pleased to have a chance to look around it.

It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of

funny little noises. A number of curious silver

instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, whirring

and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were

covered with portraits of old headmasters and

headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in

their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-

footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a

shabby, tattered wizard’s hat — the Sorting Hat

 

Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the

sleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it

couldn’t hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on

again? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him

in the right House —

He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from

its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was

much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just

as it had done the last time he’d put it on. Harry

stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a

small voice said in his ear, “Bee in your bonnet, Harry

Potter?”

“Er, yes,” Harry muttered. “Er — sorry to bother you

— I wanted to ask — ”

“You’ve been wondering whether I put you in the right

House,” said the hat smartly. “Yes ... you were

particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I

said before” — Harry’s heart leapt — “you would have

done well in Slytherin — ”

Harry’s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of

the hat and pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand,

grubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its

shelf, feeling sick.

“You’re wrong,” he said aloud to the still and silent

hat. It didn’t move. Harry backed away, watching it.

Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him

wheel around.

He wasn’t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch

behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that

resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it

and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging

noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes

 

were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more

feathers fell out of its tail.

Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for

Dumbledore ’s pet bird to die while he was alone in

the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.

Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk.

He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass

of water somewhere but couldn’t see one; the bird,

meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud

shriek and next second there was nothing but a

smoldering pile of ash on the floor.

The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking

very somber.

“Professor,” Harry gasped. “Your bird — I couldn’t do

anything — he just caught fire — ”

To Harry’s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.

“About time, too,” he said. “He’s been looking dreadful

for days; I’ve been telling him to get a move on.”

He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry’s face.

“Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into

flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn

from the ashes. Watch him ...”

Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled,

newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. It was

quite as ugly as the old one.

“It’s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,”

said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk.

“He’s really very handsome most of the time,

wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating

 

creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely

heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and

they make highly faithful pets.”

In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had

forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back

to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high

chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his

penetrating, light-blue stare.

Before Dumbledore could speak another word,

however, the door of the office flew open with an

almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his

eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black

head and the dead rooster still swinging from his

hand.

“It wasn’ Harry, Professor Dumbledore!” said Hagrid

urgently. “I was talkin’ ter him seconds before that

kid was found, he never had time, sir — ”

Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went

ranting on, waving the rooster around in his

agitation, sending feathers everywhere.

“ — it can’t’ve bin him, I’ll swear it in front o’ the

Ministry o’ Magic if I have to — ”

“Hagrid, I — ”

“ — yeh’ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never

“Hagridl” said Dumbledore loudly. “I do not think that

Harry attacked those people.”

“Oh,” said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his

side. “Right. I’ll wait outside then, Headmaster.”

 

And he stomped out looking embarrassed.

“You don’t think it was me, Professor?” Harry

repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster

feathers off his desk.

“No, Harry, I don’t,” said Dumbledore, though his face

was somber again. “But I still want to talk to you.”

Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered

him, the tips of his long fingers together.

“I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything

you’d like to tell me,” he said gently. “Anything at all.”

Harry didn’t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy

shouting, “You’ll be next, Mudbloods!” and of the

Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle’s

bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice

he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had

said: “ Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good

sign, even in the wizarding world.” He thought, too,

about what everyone was saying about him, and his

growing dread that he was somehow connected with

Salazar Slytherin. ...

“No,” said Harry. “There isn’t anything, Professor. ...”

The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless

Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into

real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick’s

fate that seemed to worry people most. What could

possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other;

what terrible power could harm someone who was

already dead? There was almost a stampede to book

seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could

go home for Christmas.

 

“At this rate, well be the only ones left,” Ron told

Harry and Hermione. “Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle.

What a jolly holiday it’s going to be.”

Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy

did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But

Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was

tired of people skirting around him in the corridors,

as though he were about to sprout fangs or spit

poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and

hissing as he passed.

Fred and George, however, found all this very funny.

They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry

down the corridors, shouting, “Make way for the Heir

of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through. ...”

Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.

“It is not a laughing matter,” he said coldly.

“Oh, get out of the way, Percy,” said Fred. “Harry’s in

a hurry.”

“Yeah, he’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of

tea with his fanged servant,” said George, chortling.

Ginny didn’t find it amusing either.

“Oh, don’t,” she wailed every time Fred asked Harry

loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when

George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove

of garlic when they met.

Harry didn’t mind; it made him feel better that Fred

and George, at least, thought the idea of his being

Slytherin ’s heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics

seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked

increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.

 

“It’s because he’s bursting to say it’s really him,” said

Ron knowingly. “You know how he hates anyone

beating him at anything, and you’re getting all the

credit for his dirty work.”

“Not for long,” said Hermione in a satisfied tone. “The

Polyjuice Potion’s nearly ready. We’ll be getting the

truth out of him any day now.”

At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the

snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry

found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed

the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the

run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play

Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and

practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny

had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in

Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who

disapproved of what he termed their childish

behavior, didn’t spend much time in the Gryffindor

common room. He had already told them pompously

that he was only staying over Christmas because it

was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers

during this troubled time.

Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry

and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were

woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully

dressed and carrying presents for them both.

“Wake up,” she said loudly, pulling back the curtains

at the window.

“Hermione — you’re not supposed to be in here — ”

said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.

“Merry Christmas to you, too,” said Hermione,

throwing him his present. “I’ve been up for nearly an

 

hour, adding more lace-wings to the potion. It’s

ready.”

Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.

“Are you sure?”

“Positive,” said Hermione, shirting Scabbers the rat so

that she could sit down on the end of Ron’s four-

poster. “If we’re going to do it, I say it should be

tonight.”

At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room,

carrying a very small package in her beak.

“Hello,” said Harry happily as she landed on his bed.

“Are you speaking to me again?”

She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way,

which was a far better present than the one that she

had brought him, which turned out to be from the

Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note

telling him to find out whether he’d be able to stay at

Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.

The rest of Harry’s Christmas presents were far more

satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle

toffee, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before

eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with

the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his

favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought

him a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the

last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from

Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card

with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr.

Weasley’s car (which hadn’t been seen since its crash

with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-

breaking he and Ron were planning next.

 

No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice

Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at

Hogwarts.

The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were

there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick

streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the

ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and

dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of

his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more

loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed.

Percy, who hadn’t noticed that Fred had bewitched

his prefect badge so that it now read “Pin-head,” kept

asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry

didn’t even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud,

snide remarks about his new sweater from the

Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be

getting his comeuppance in a few hours’ time.

Harry and Ron had barely finished their third

helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione

ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for

the evening.

“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing

into,” said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she

were sending them to the supermarket for laundry

detergent. “And obviously, it’ll be best if you can get

something of Crabbe’s and Goyle’s; they’re Malfoy’s

best friends, he’ll tell them anything. And we also

need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can’t

burst in on us while we’re interrogating him.

“I’ve got it all worked out,” she went on smoothly,

ignoring Harry’s and Ron’s stupefied faces. She held

up two plump chocolate cakes. “I’ve filled these with a

simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make

sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how

greedy they are, they’re bound to eat them. Once

 

they’re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide

them in a broom closet.”

Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.

“Hermione, I don’t think — ”

“That could go seriously wrong — ”

But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike

the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had.

“The potion will be useless without Crabbe’s and

Goyle’s hair,” she said sternly. “You do want to

investigate Malfoy, don’t you?”

“Oh, all right, all right,” said Harry. “But what about

you? Whose hair are you ripping out?”

“I’ve already got mine!” said Hermione brightly,

pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing

them the single hair inside it. “Remember Millicent

Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She

left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle

me! And she’s gone home for Christmas — so I’ll just

have to tell the Slytherins I’ve decided to come back.”

When Hermione had bustled off to check on the

Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a

doom-laden expression.

“Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things

could go wrong?”

But to Harry’s and Ron’s utter amazement, stage one

of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione

had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall

after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle

who had remained alone at the Slytherin table,

 

shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had

perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the

banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle

coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid

quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.

“How thick can you get?” Ron whispered ecstatically

as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle

and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the

cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment,

both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on

their faces. Then, without the smallest change of

expression, they both keeled over backward onto the

floor.

By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet

across the hall. Once they were safely stowed among

the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of

the bristles that covered Goyle ’s forehead and Ron

pulled out several of Crabbe ’s hairs. They also stole

their shoes, because their own were far too small for

Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at

what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning

Myrtle’s bathroom.

They could hardly see for the thick black smoke

issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring

the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces,

Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.

“Hermione?”

They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione

emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious. Behind

her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling,

glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on

the toilet seat.

“Did you get them?” Hermione asked breathlessly.

 

Harry showed her Goyle’s hair.

“Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the

laundry,” Hermione said, holding up a small sack.

“You’ll need bigger sizes once you’re Crabbe and

Goyle.”

The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up,

the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling

sluggishly.

“I’m sure I’ve done everything right,” said Hermione,

nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste

Potente Potions. “It looks like the book says it should

... once we’ve drunk it, we’ll have exactly an hour

before we change back into ourselves.”

“Now what?” Ron whispered.

“We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.”

Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each

of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook

Millicent Bulstrode’s hair out of its bottle into the first

glass.

The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and

frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick

sort of yellow.

“Urgh — essence of Millicent Bulstrode,” said Ron,

eyeing it with loathing. “Bet it tastes disgusting.”

“Add yours, then,” said Hermione.

Harry dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and

Ron put Crabbe’s into the last one. Both glasses

hissed and frothed: Goyle’s turned the khaki color of

a booger, Crabbe’s a dark, murky brown.

 

“Hang on,” said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached

for their glasses. “We’d better not all drink them in

here. ... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won’t

fit. And Millicent Bulstrode’s no pixie.”

“Good thinking,” said Ron, unlocking the door. “We’ll

take separate stalls.”

Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion,

Harry slipped into the middle stall.

“Ready?” he called.

“Ready,” came Ron’s and Hermione’s voices.

“One — two — three — ”

Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in

two large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage.

Immediately, his insides started writhing as though

he’d just swallowed live snakes — doubled up, he

wondered whether he was going to be sick — then a

burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to

the very ends of his fingers and toes — next, bringing

him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting

feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot

wax — and before his eyes, his hands began to grow,

the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the

knuckles were bulging like bolts — his shoulders

stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead

told him that hair was creeping down toward his

eyebrows — his robes ripped as his chest expanded

like a barrel bursting its hoops — his feet were agony

in shoes four sizes too small —

As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped.

Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening

to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With

 

difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So

this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand

trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were

hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare

ones, and laced up Goyle’s boatlike shoes. He reached

up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the

short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead.

Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his

eyes because Goyle obviously didn’t need them — he

took them off and called, “Are you two okay?” Goyle’s

low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.

“Yeah,” came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.

Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the

cracked mirror. Goyle stared back at him out of dull,

deepset eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle.

Ron’s door opened. They stared at each other. Except

that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was

indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-

bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.

“This is unbelievable,” said Ron, approaching the

mirror and prodding Crabbe ’s flat nose.

“Unbelievable.”

“We’d better get going,” said Harry, loosening the

watch that was cutting into Goyle’s thick wrist. “We’ve

still got to find out where the Slytherin common room

is. I only hope we can find someone to follow ...”

Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, “You don’t

know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.” He

banged on Hermione’s door. “C’mon, we need to go — ”

A high-pitched voice answered him.

 

“I — I don’t think I’m going to come after all. You go

on without me.”

“Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode’s ugly, no

one’s going to know it’s you — ”

“No — really — I don’t think I’ll come. You two hurry

up, you’re wasting time — ”

Harry looked at Ron, bewildered.

“That looks more like Goyle,” said Ron. “That’s how he

looks every time a teacher asks him a question.”

“Hermione, are you okay?” said Harry through the

door.

“Fine — I’m fine — go on — ”

Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty

minutes had already passed.

“Well meet you back here, all right?” he said.

Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom

carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set

off.

“Don’t swing your arms like that,” Harry muttered to

Ron.

“Eh?”

“Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. ...”

“How’s this?”

“Yeah, that’s better. ...”

 

They went down the marble staircase. All they needed

now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the

Slytherin common room, but there was nobody

around.

“Any ideas?” muttered Harry.

“The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from

over there,” said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the

dungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when

a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance.

“Excuse me,” said Ron, hurrying up to her. “We’ve

forgotten the way to our common room.”

“I beg your pardon?” said the girl stiffly. “Our common

room? I’m a Ravenclaw.”

She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.

Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the

darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly

as Crabbe’s and Goyle’s huge feet hit the floor, feeling

that this wasn’t going to be as easy as they had

hoped.

The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked

deeper and deeper under the school, constantly

checking their watches to see how much time they

had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they

were getting desperate, they heard a sudden

movement ahead.

“Ha!” said Ron excitedly. “There’s one of them now!”

The figure was emerging from a side room. As they

hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn’t a

Slytherin, it was Percy.

 

“What’re you doing down here?” said Ron in surprise.

Percy looked affronted.

“That,” he said stiffly, “is none of your business. It’s

Crabbe, isn’t it?”

“Wh — oh, yeah,” said Ron.

“Well, get off to your dormitories,” said Percy sternly.

“It’s not safe to go wandering around dark corridors

these days.”

“You are,” Ron pointed out.

“I,” said Percy, drawing himself up, “am a prefect.

Nothing’s about to attack me.”

A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron.

Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the

first time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him.

“There you are,” he drawled, looking at them. “Have

you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this

time? I’ve been looking for you; I want to show you

something really funny.”

Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.

“And what’re you doing down here, Weasley?” he

sneered.

Percy looked outraged.

“You want to show a bit more respect to a school

prefect!” he said. “I don’t like your attitude!”

Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to

follow him. Harry almost said something apologetic to

 

Percy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron

hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the

next passage, “That Peter Weasley — ”

“Percy,” Ron corrected him automatically.

“Whatever,” said Malfoy. “I’ve noticed him sneaking

around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he’s up to.

He thinks he’s going to catch Slytherin’s heir single-

handed.”

He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron

exchanged excited looks.

Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.

“What’s the new password again?” he said to Harry.

“Er — ” said Harry.

“Oh, yeah — pure-blood\” said Malfoy, not listening,

and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open.

Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron

followed him.

The Slytherin common room was a long, low

underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling

from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on

chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately

carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several

Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed

chairs.

“Wait here,” said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning

them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire.

“I’ll go and get it — my father’s just sent it to me — ”

 

Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them,

Harry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at

home.

Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked

like a newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron’s

nose.

“That’ll give you a laugh,” he said.

Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock. He read the

clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and

handed it to Harry.

It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it

said:

INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC

Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle

Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for

bewitching a Muggle car.

Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of

Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the enchanted car

crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr.

Weasley’s resignation.

“Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,”

Mr. Malfoy told our reporter. “He is clearly unfit to

draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle

Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.”

Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although

his wife told reporters to clear off or she’d set the

family ghoul on them.

 

“Well?” said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the

clipping back to him. “Don’t you think it’s funny?”

“Ha, ha,” said Harry bleakly.

“Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should

snap his wand in half and go and join them,” said

Malfoy scornfully. “You’d never know the Weasleys

were purebloods, the way they behave.”

Ron’s — or rather, Crabbe’s — face was contorted

with fury.

“What’s up with you, Crabbe?” snapped Malfoy.

“Stomachache,” Ron grunted.

“Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those

Mudbloods a kick from me,” said Malfoy, snickering.

“You know, I’m surprised the Daily Prophet hasn’t

reported all these attacks yet,” he went on

thoughtfully. “I suppose Dumbledore’s trying to hush

it all up. He’ll be sacked if it doesn’t stop soon.

Father’s always said old Dumbledore’s the worst thing

that’s ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-

borns. A decent headmaster would never ’ve let slime

like that Creevey in.”

Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary

camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of

Colin: “ ‘Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I

have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please,

Potter?’ ”

He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.

“What’s the matter with you two?”

 

Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to

laugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe

and Goyle were always slow on the uptake.

“Saint Potter, the Mudbloods’ friend,” said Malfoy

slowly. “He’s another one with no proper wizard

feeling, or he wouldn’t go around with that jumped-up

Granger Mudblood. And people think he’s Slytherin’s

heir!”

Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was

surely seconds away from telling them it was him —

but then —

“I wish I knew who it is,” said Malfoy petulantly. “I

could help them.”

Ron’s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more

clueless than usual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn’t notice,

and Harry, thinking fast, said, “You must have some

idea who’s behind it all. ...”

“You know I haven’t, Goyle, how many times do I have

to tell you?” snapped Malfoy. “And Father won’t tell

me anything about the last time the Chamber was

opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it

was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he

says that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious

if I know too much about it. But I know one thing —

last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a

Mudblood died. So I bet it’s a matter of time before

one of them’s killed this time. ... I hope it’s Granger,”

he said with relish.

Ron was clenching Crabbe ’s gigantic fists. Feeling

that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched

Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said,

“D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber

last time was caught?”

 

“Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,” said

Malfoy. “They’re probably still in Azkaban.”

“Azkaban?” said Harry, puzzled.

“Azkaban — the wizard prison , Goyle,” said Malfoy,

looking at him in disbelief. “Honestly, if you were any

slower, you’d be going backward.”

He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, “Father

says to keep my head down and let the Heir of

Slytherin get on with it. He says the school needs

ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed

up in it. Of course, he’s got a lot on his plate at the

moment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our

manor last week?”

Harry tried to force Goyle ’s dull face into a look of

concern.

“Yeah ...” said Malfoy. “Luckily, they didn’t find much.

Father’s got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But

luckily, we’ve got our own secret chamber under the

drawing-room floor — ”

“Ho!” said Ron.

Malfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed.

Even his hair was turning red. His nose was also

slowly lengthening — their hour was up, Ron was

turning back into himself, and from the look of horror

he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.

They both jumped to their feet.

“Medicine for my stomach,” Ron grunted, and without

further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin

common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall,

and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that

 

Malfoy hadn’t noticed anything. Harry could feel his

feet slipping around in Goyle’s huge shoes and had to

hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the

steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a

muffled pounding coming from the closet where

they’d locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes

outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks

up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle’s

bathroom.

“Well, it wasn’t a complete waste of time,” Ron

panted, closing the bathroom door behind them. “I

know we still haven’t found out who’s doing the

attacks, but I’m going to write to Dad tomorrow and

tell him to check under the Malfoys’ drawing room.”

Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was

back to normal. He put his glasses on as Ron

hammered on the door of Hermione’s stall.

“Hermione, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you — ”

“Go away!” Hermione squeaked.

Harry and Ron looked at each other.

“What’s the matter?” said Ron. “You must be back to

normal by now, we are — ”

But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall

door. Harry had never seen her looking so happy.

“Ooooooh, wait till you see,” she said. “It’s awful — ”

They heard the lock slide back and Hermione

emerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head.

“What’s up?” said Ron uncertainly. “Have you still got

Millicent’s nose or something?”

 

Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the

sink.

Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had

turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears

poking through her hair.

“It was a c-cat hair!” she howled. “M-Millicent

Bulstrode m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn’t

supposed to be used for animal transformations!”

“Uh-oh,” said Ron.

“You’ll be teased something dreadful,” said Myrtle

happily.

“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take

you up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never

asks too many questions. ...”

It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the

bathroom. Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way

with a hearty guffaw. “Wait till everyone finds out

you’ve got a tail\”

 

* V

THE VERY SECRET DIARY

Hermione remained in the hospital wing for several

weeks. There was a flurry of rumor about her

disappearance when the rest of the school arrived

back from their Christmas holidays, because of

course everyone thought that she had been attacked.

So many students filed past the hospital wing trying

to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took

out her curtains again and placed them around

Hermione’s bed, to spare her the shame of being seen

with a furry face.

Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When

the new term started, they brought her each day’s

homework.

“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,”

said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione’s

bedside table one evening.

“Don’t be silly, Ron, I’ve got to keep up,” said

Hermione briskly. Her spirits were greatly improved

by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face

 

and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. “I

don’t suppose you’ve got any new leads?” she added

in a whisper, so that Madam Pomfrey couldn’t hear

her.

“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily.

“I was so sure it was Malfoy,” said Ron, for about the

hundredth time.

“What’s that?” asked Harry, pointing to something

gold sticking out from under Hermione’s pillow.

“Just a get well card,” said Hermione hastily, trying to

poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He

pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud:

“To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from

your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart,

Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the

Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of

Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award.”

Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted.

“You sleep with this under your pillow?”

But Hermione was spared answering by Madam

Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of

medicine.

“Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you’ve ever met, or

what?” Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary

and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower.

Snape had given them so much homework, Harry

thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he

finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had

asked Hermione how many rat tails you were

supposed to add to a Hair-Raising Potion when an

 

angry outburst from the floor above reached their

ears.

“That’s Filch,” Harry muttered as they hurried up the

stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard.

“You don’t think someone else’s been attacked?” said

Ron tensely.

They stood still, their heads inclined toward Filch’s

voice, which sounded quite hysterical.

“ — even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I

haven’t got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I’m

going to Dumbledore — ”

His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor

and they heard a distant door slam.

They poked their heads around the corner. Filch had

clearly been manning his usual lookout post: They

were once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had

been attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had

been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched

over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was

still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle’s

bathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they

could hear Myrtle’s wails echoing off the bathroom

walls.

“Now what’s up with her?” said Ron.

“Let’s go and see,” said Harry, and holding their robes

over their ankles they stepped through the great wash

of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign,

ignored it as always, and entered.

Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and

harder than ever before. She seemed to be hiding

 

down her usual toilet. It was dark in the bathroom

because the candles had been extinguished in the

great rush of water that had left both walls and floor

soaking wet.

“What’s up, Myrtle?” said Harry.

“Who’s that?” glugged Myrtle miserably. “Come to

throw something else at me?”

Harry waded across to her stall and said, “Why would

I throw something at you?”

“Don’t ask me,” Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave

of yet more water, which splashed onto the already

sopping floor. “Here I am, minding my own business,

and someone thinks it’s funny to throw a book at me.

“But it can’t hurt you if someone throws something at

you,” said Harry, reasonably. “I mean, it’d just go

right through you, wouldn’t it?”

He had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up

and shrieked, “Let’s all throw books at Myrtle,

because she can’t feel it! Ten points if you can get it

through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through

her head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don’t

think!”

“Who threw it at you, anyway?” asked Harry.

“I don’t know. ... I was just sitting in the U-bend,

thinking about death, and it fell right through the top

of my head,” said Myrtle, glaring at them. “It’s over

there, it got washed out. ...”

Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle

was pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a

 

shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else

in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up,

but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.

“What?” said Harry.

“Are you cra2y?” said Ron. “It could be dangerous.”

“ Dangerous ?” said Harry, laughing. “Come off it, how

could it be dangerous?”

“You’d be surprised,” said Ron, who was looking

apprehensively at the book. “Some of the books the

Ministry’s confiscated — Dad’s told me — there was

one that burned your eyes out. And everyone who

read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the

rest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a

book that you could never stop reading ! You just had

to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do

everything one-handed. And — ”

“All right, I’ve got the point,” said Harry.

The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and

soggy.

“Well, we won’t find out unless we look at it,” he said,

and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the

floor.

Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded

year on the cover told him it was fifty years old. He

opened it eagerly. On the first page he could just

make out the name “T. M. Riddle” in smudged ink.

“Hang on,” said Ron, who had approached cautiously

and was looking over Harry’s shoulder. “I know that

name. ... T. M. Riddle got an award for special

services to the school fifty years ago.”

 

“How on earth d’you know that?” said Harry in

amazement.

“Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty

times in detention,” said Ron resentfully. “That was

the one I burped slugs all over. If you’d wiped slime

off a name for an hour, you’d remember it, too.”

Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were

completely blank. There wasn’t the faintest trace of

writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel’s

birthday, or dentist, half-past three.

“He never wrote in it,” said Harry, disappointed.

“I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?” said

Ron curiously.

Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw

the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road,

London.

“He must’ve been Muggle-born,” said Harry

thoughtfully. “To have bought a diary from Vauxhall

Road. ...”

“Well, it’s not much use to you,” said Ron. He

dropped his voice. “Fifty points if you can get it

through Myrtle’s nose.”

Harry, however, pocketed it.

Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-

less, and fur-free, at the beginning of February. On

her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry

showed her T. M. Riddle’s diary and told her the story

of how they had found it.

 

“Oooh, it might have hidden powers,” said Hermione

enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it

closely.

“If it has, it’s hiding them very well,” said Ron. “Maybe

it’s shy. I don’t know why you don’t chuck it, Harry.”

“I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,” said

Harry. “I wouldn’t mind knowing how Riddle got an

award for special services to Hogwarts either.”

“Could’ve been anything,” said Ron. “Maybe he got

thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant

squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would’ve done

everyone a favor. ...”

But Harry could tell from the arrested look on

Hermione ’s face that she was thinking what he was

thinking.

“What?” said Ron, looking from one to the other.

“Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years

ago, wasn’t it?” he said. “That’s what Malfoy said.”

“Yeah ...” said Ron slowly.

“And this diary is fifty years old,” said Hermione,

tapping it excitedly.

“So?”

“Oh, Ron, wake up,” snapped Hermione. “We know

the person who opened the Chamber last time was

expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an

award for special services to the school fifty years

ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for

catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would

probably tell us everything — where the Chamber is,

 

and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in

it — the person who’s behind the attacks this time

wouldn’t want that lying around, would they?”

“That’s a brilliant theory, Hermione,” said Ron, “with

just one tiny little flaw. There’s nothing written in his

diary.”

But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.

“It might be invisible ink!” she whispered.

She tapped the diary three times and said,

“Aparecium\”

Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her

hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared

to be a bright red eraser.

“It’s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,” she said.

She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.

“I’m telling you, there’s nothing to find in there,” said

Ron. “Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and

couldn’t be bothered filling it in.”

Harry couldn’t explain, even to himself, why he didn’t

just throw Riddle’s diary away. The fact was that even

though he knew the diary was blank, he kept

absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages,

as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And

while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T.

M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to

him, almost as though Riddle was a friend he’d had

when he was very small, and had half-forgotten. But

this was absurd. He’d never had friends before

Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.

 

Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more

about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the

trophy room to examine Riddle’s special award,

accompanied by an interested Hermione and a

thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he’d

seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime.

Riddle’s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a

corner cabinet. It didn’t carry details of why it had

been given to him (“Good thing, too, or it’d be even

bigger and I’d still be polishing it,” said Ron).

However, they did find Riddle’s name on an old Medal

for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys.

“He sounds like Percy,” said Ron, wrinkling his nose

in disgust. “Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every

class — ”

“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” said Hermione in a

slightly hurt voice.

The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts

again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more

hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those

on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam

Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes

were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that

they were fast leaving childhood.

“The moment their acne clears up, they’ll be ready for

repotting again,” Harry heard her telling Filch kindly

one afternoon. “And after that, it won’t be long until

we’re cutting them up and stewing them. You’ll have

Mrs. Norris back in no time.”

Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her

nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and

riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the

school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster,

 

whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to

hibernate for another fifty years. ...

Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn’t take this cheerful

view. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty

one, that he had “given himself away” at the Dueling

Club. Peeves wasn’t helping matters; he kept popping

up in the crowded corridors singing “Oh, Potter, you

rotter ...” now with a dance routine to match.

Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had

made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling

Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were

lining up for Transfiguration.

“I don’t think there’ll be any more trouble, Minerva,”

he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. “I

think the Chamber has been locked for good this

time. The culprit must have known it was only a

matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to

stop now, before I came down hard on him.

“You know, what the school needs now is a morale-

booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won’t

say any more just now, but I think I know just the

thing. ...”

He tapped his nose again and strode off.

Lockhart’s idea of a morale-booster became clear at

breakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn’t

had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch

practice the night before, and he hurried down to the

Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment,

that he’d walked through the wrong doors.

The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink

flowers. Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling

from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the

 

Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking

sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been

overcome with giggles.

“What’s going on?” Harry asked them, sitting down

and wiping confetti off his bacon.

Ron pointed to the teachers’ table, apparently too

disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink

robes to match the decorations, was waving for

silence. The teachers on either side of him were

looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could

see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall’s cheek.

Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a

large beaker of Skele-Gro.

“Happy Valentine’s Day!” Lockhart shouted. “And may

I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me

cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this

little surprise for you all — and it doesn’t end here!”

Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to

the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking

dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had

them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.

“My friendly, card-carrying cupids!” beamed Lockhart.

“They will be roving around the school today

delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn’t stop

here! I’m sure my colleagues will want to enter into

the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor

Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And

while you’re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more

about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I’ve

ever met, the sly old dog!”

Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape

was looking as though the first person to ask him for

a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.

 

“Please, Hermione, tell me you weren’t one of the

forty-six,” said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their

first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very

interested in searching her bag for her schedule and

didn’t answer.

All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their

classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the

teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors

were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs

caught up with Harry.

“Oy, you! ’Arry Potter!” shouted a particularly grim-

looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to

Harry.

Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine

in front of a line of first years, which happened to

include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The

dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by

kicking people’s shins, and reached him before he’d

gone two paces.

“I’ve got a musical message to deliver to ’Arry Potter in

person,” he said, twanging his harp in a threatening

sort of way.

“Not here,” Harry hissed, trying to escape.

“Stay stilll” grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of

Harry’s bag and pulling him back.

“Let me go!” Harry snarled, tugging.

With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His

books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the

floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything.

 

Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up

before the dwarf started singing, causing something of

a holdup in the corridor.

“What’s going on here?” came the cold, drawling voice

of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything

feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away

before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.

“What’s all this commotion?” said another familiar

voice as Percy Weasley arrived.

Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but

the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought

him crashing to the floor.

“Right,” he said, sitting on Harry’s ankles. “Here is

your singing valentine:

His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,

His hair is as dark as a blackboard.

I wish he was mine, he’s really divine,

The hero who conquered the Dark Lord.”

Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to

evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along

with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the

weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to

disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with

mirth.

“Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago,

off to class, now,” he said, shooing some of the

younger students away. “And you, Malfoy — ”

 

Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up

something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and

Goyle, and Harry realized that he’d got Riddle’s diary.

“Give that back,” said Harry quietly.

“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” said Malfoy,

who obviously hadn’t noticed the year on the cover

and thought he had Harry’s own diary. A hush fell

over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary

to Harry, looking terrified.

“Hand it over, Malfoy,” said Percy sternly.

“When I’ve had a look,” said Malfoy, waving the diary

tauntingly at Harry.

Percy said, “As a school prefect — ” but Harry had lost

his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted,

“ ExpelliarmusV’ and just as Snape had disarmed

Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of

his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught

it.

“Harry!” said Percy loudly. “No magic in the corridors.

I’ll have to report this, you know!”

But Harry didn’t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and

that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day.

Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him

to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her,

“I don’t think Potter liked your valentine much!”

Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into

class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but

Harry pulled him away. Ron didn’t need to spend the

whole of Charms belching slugs.

 

It wasn’t until they had reached Professor Flitwick’s

class that Harry noticed something rather odd about

Riddle’s diary. All his other books were drenched in

scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had

been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He

tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having

trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles

were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn’t much

interested in anything else.

Jc Jc Jc

Harry went to bed before anyone else in his

dormitory that night. This was partly because he

didn’t think he could stand Fred and George singing,

“His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad” one

more time, and partly because he wanted to examine

Riddle’s diary again, and knew that Ron thought he

was wasting his time.

Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the

blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet

ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his

bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped

a blot onto the first page of the diary.

The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and

then, as though it was being sucked into the page,

vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second

time and wrote, “My name is Harry Potter.”

The words shone momentarily on the page and they,

too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something

happened.

Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink,

came words Harry had never written.

 

“Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did

you come by my diary?”

These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry

had started to scribble back.

“Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.”

He waited eagerly for Riddle’s reply.

“Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more

lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there

would be those who would not want this diary read.”

“What do you mean?” Harry scrawled, blotting the

page in his excitement.

“I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible

things. Things that were covered up. Things that

happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and

Wizardry.”

“That’s where I am now,” Harry wrote quickly. “I’m at

Hogwarts, and horrible stuff’s been happening. Do

you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?”

His heart was hammering. Riddle’s reply came

quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he

was hurrying to tell all he knew.

“Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my

day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist.

But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was

opened and the monster attacked several students,

finally killing one. I caught the person who’d opened

the Chamber and he was expelled. But the

headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a

thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell

the truth. A story was given out that the girl had died

 

in a freak accident They gave me a nice, shiny,

engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep

my mouth shut But I knew it could happen again. The

monster lived on, and the one who had the power to

release it was not imprisoned.”

Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write

back.

“It’s happening again now. There have been three

attacks and no one seems to know who’s behind

them. Who was it last time?”

“ I can show you, if you like,” came Riddle’s reply. “You

don’t have to take my word for it. I can take you inside

my memory of the night when I caught him.”

Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary.

What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside

somebody else’s memory? He glanced nervously at the

door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When

he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words

forming.

“Let me show you.”

Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then

wrote two letters.

“OK.”

The pages of the diary began to blow as though

caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the

month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that

the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have

turned into a minuscule television screen. His hands

trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye

against the little window, and before he knew what

was happening, he was tilting forward; the window

 

was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he

was pitched headfirst through the opening in the

page, into a whirl of color and shadow.

He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking,

as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly

into focus.

He knew immediately where he was. This circular

room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore’s

office — but it wasn’t Dumbledore who was sitting

behind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald

except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a

letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man

before.

“I’m sorry,” he said shakily. “I didn’t mean to butt in

But the wizard didn’t look up. He continued to read,

frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and

stammered, “Er — I’ll just go, shall I?”

Still the wizard ignored him. He didn’t seem even to

have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be

deaf, Harry raised his voice.

“Sorry I disturbed you. I’ll go now,” he half-shouted.

The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up,

walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went

to draw the curtains at his window.

The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed

to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat

down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.

Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the

phoenix — no whirring silver contraptions. This was

 

Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this

unknown wizard was headmaster, not Dumbledore,

and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom,

completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.

There was a knock on the office door.

“Enter,” said the old wizard in a feeble voice.

A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed

hat. A silver prefect’s badge was glinting on his chest.

He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-

black hair.

“Ah, Riddle,” said the headmaster.

“You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?” said

Riddle. He looked nervous.

“Sit down,” said Dippet. “I’ve just been reading the

letter you sent me.”

“Oh,” said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands

together very tightly.

“My dear boy,” said Dippet kindly, “I cannot possibly

let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you

want to go home for the holidays?”

“No,” said Riddle at once. “I’d much rather stay at

Hogwarts than go back to that — to that — ”

“You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I

believe?” said Dippet curiously.

“Yes, sir,” said Riddle, reddening slightly.

“You are Muggle-born?”

 

“Half-blood, sir,” said Riddle. “Muggle father, witch

mother.”

“And are both your parents — ?”

“My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told

me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to

name me — Tom after my father, Marvolo after my

grandfather.”

Dippet clucked his tongue sympathetically.

“The thing is, Tom,” he sighed, “special arrangements

might have been made for you, but in the current

circumstances. ...”

“You mean all these attacks, sir?” said Riddle, and

Harry’s heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of

missing anything.

“Precisely,” said the headmaster. “My dear boy, you

must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to

remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in

light of the recent tragedy . . . the death of that poor

little girl. ... You will be safer by far at your

orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic

is even now talking about closing the school. We are

no nearer locating the — er — source of all this

unpleasantness. ...”

Riddle’s eyes had widened.

“Sir — if the person was caught — if it all stopped — ”

“What do you mean?” said Dippet with a squeak in

his voice, sitting up in his chair. “Riddle, do you mean

you know something about these attacks?”

“No, sir,” said Riddle quickly.

 

But Harry was sure it was the same sort of “no” that

he himself had given Dumbledore.

Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.

“You may go, Tom. ...”

Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room.

Harry followed him.

Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging

next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle

stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could

tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He

was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.

Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision,

he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him.

They didn’t see another person until they reached the

entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping

auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the

marble staircase.

“What are you doing, wandering around this late,

Tom?”

Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a

fifty-year-younger Dumbledore.

“I had to see the headmaster, sir,” said Riddle.

“Well, hurry off to bed,” said Dumbledore, giving

Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry

knew so well. “Best not to roam the corridors these

days. Not since ...”

He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode

off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then,

 

moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps

to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.

But to Harry’s disappointment, Riddle led him not

into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to

the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with

Snape. The torches hadn’t been lit, and when Riddle

pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just

see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching

the passage outside.

It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an

hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the

door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue.

And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant

and tense and started wishing he could return to the

present, he heard something move beyond the door.

Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard

whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle

were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged

through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind

him, forgetting that he couldn’t be heard.

For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps,

until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in

the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak

open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse

whisper.

“C’mon ... gotta get yeh outta here. ... C’mon now ...

in the box ...”

There was something familiar about that voice. ...

Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry

stepped out behind him. He could see the dark

outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of

an open door, a very large box next to it.

 

“ ’Evening, Rubeus,” said Riddle sharply.

The boy slammed the door shut and stood up.

“What yer doin’ down here, Tom?”

Riddle stepped closer.

“It’s all over,” he said. “I’m going to have to turn you

in, Rubeus. They’re talking about closing Hogwarts if

the attacks don’t stop.”

“What d’yeh — ”

“I don’t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters

don’t make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for

exercise and — ”

“It never killed no one!” said the large boy, backing

against the closed door. From behind him, Harry

could hear a funny rustling and clicking.

“Come on, Rubeus,” said Riddle, moving yet closer.

“The dead girl’s parents will be here tomorrow. The

least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing

that killed their daughter is slaughtered. ...”

“It wasn’t him!” roared the boy, his voice echoing in

the dark passage. “He wouldn’! He never!”

“Stand aside,” said Riddle, drawing out his wand.

His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light.

The door behind the large boy flew open with such

force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of

it came something that made Harry let out a long,

piercing scream unheard by anyone —

 

A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black

legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp

pincers — Riddle raised his wand again, but he was

too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled

away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle

scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his

wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his

wand, and threw him back down, yelling,

“NOOOOOOO!”

The scene whirled, the darkness became complete;

Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed

spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor

dormitory, Riddle’s diary lying open on his stomach.

Before he had had time to regain his breath, the

dormitory door opened and Ron came in.

“There you are,” he said.

Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.

“What’s up?” said Ron, looking at him with concern.

“It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of

Secrets fifty years ago.”

 

CORNELIUS FUDGE

Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that

Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and

monstrous creatures. During their first year at

Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little

wooden house, and it would be a long time before

they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d

christened “Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard

that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle,

Harry was sure he’d have gone to any lengths for a

glimpse of it. He’d probably thought it was a shame

that the monster had been cooped up so long, and

thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many

legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old

Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he

was equally certain that Hagrid would never have

meant to kill anybody.

Harry half wished he hadn’t found out how to work

Riddle’s diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione

made him recount what he’d seen, until he was

heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long,

circular conversations that followed.

 

“Riddle might have got the wrong person,” said

Hermione. “Maybe it was some other monster that

was attacking people. ...”

“How many monsters d’you think this place can

hold?” Ron asked dully.

“We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,” said

Harry miserably. “And the attacks must’ve stopped

after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle

wouldn’t have got his award.”

Ron tried a different tack.

“Riddle does sound like Percy — who asked him to

squeal on Hagrid, anyway?”

“But the monster had killed someone, Ron,” said

Hermione.

“And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle

orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I

don’t blame him for wanting to stay here. ...”

“You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn’t you,

Harry?”

“He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” said

Harry quickly.

The three of them fell silent. After a long pause,

Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a

hesitant voice.

“Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it

all?”

 

“That’d be a cheerful visit,” said Ron. “ ‘Hello, Hagrid.

Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and

hairy loose in the castle lately?’ ”

In the end, they decided that they would not say

anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack,

and as more and more days went by with no whisper

from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that

they would never need to talk to him about why he

had been expelled. It was now nearly four months

since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been

Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that

the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good.

Peeves had finally got bored of his “Oh, Potter, you

rotter” song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite

politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in

Herbology one day, and in March several of the

Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in

greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very

happy.

“The moment they start trying to move into each

other’s pots, we’ll know they’re fully mature,” she told

Harry. “Then we’ll be able to revive those poor people

in the hospital wing.”

The second years were given something new to think

about during their Easter holidays. The time had

come to choose their subjects for the third year, a

matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.

“It could affect our whole future,” she told Harry and

Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking

them with checks.

“I just want to give up Potions,” said Harry.

 

“We can’t,” said Ron gloomily. “We keep all our old

subjects, or I’d’ve ditched Defense Against the Dark

Arts.”

“But that’s very important!” said Hermione, shocked.

“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t

learned anything from him except not to set pixies

loose.”

Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the

witches and wizards in his family, all giving him

different advice on what to choose. Confused and

worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his

tongue poking out, asking people whether they

thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the

study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like

Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing

his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking

the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody’s

advice but signed up for everything.

Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried

to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that

he didn’t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager

to share his experience.

“Depends where you want to go, Harry,” he said. “It’s

never too early to think about the future, so I’d

recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is

a soft option, but I personally think wizards should

have a thorough understanding of the non-magical

community, particularly if they’re thinking of working

in close contact with them — look at my father, he

has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My

brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type,

so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your

strengths, Harry.”

 

But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at

was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new

subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them,

at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.

Gryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against

Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices

every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had

time for anything but Quidditch and homework.

However, the training sessions were getting better, or

at least drier, and the evening before Saturday’s

match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his

broomstick feeling Gryffindor’s chances for the

Quidditch Cup had never been better.

But his cheerful mood didn’t last long. At the top of

the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville

Longbottom, who was looking frantic.

“Harry — I don’t know who did it — I just found — ”

Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the

door.

The contents of Harry’s trunk had been thrown

everywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The

bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the

drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet,

the contents strewn over the mattress.

Harry walked over to the bed, openmouthed, treading

on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and

Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron,

Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly.

“What happened, Harry?”

“No idea,” said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry’s

robes. All the pockets were hanging out.

 

“Someone’s been looking for something,” said Ron. “Is

there anything missing?”

Harry started to pick up all his things and throw

them into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last

of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized

what wasn’t there.

“Riddle’s diary’s gone,” he said in an undertone to

Ron.

“What?”

Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and

Ron followed him out. They hurried down to the

Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and

joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a

book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.

Hermione looked aghast at the news.

“But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody

else knows our password — ”

“Exactly,” said Harry.

They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a

light, refreshing breeze.

“Perfect Quidditch conditions!” said Wood

enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the

team’s plates with scrambled eggs. “Harry, buck up

there, you need a decent breakfast.”

Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor

table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle’s diary

was right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been

urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn’t like

the idea. He’d have to tell a teacher all about the

 

diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had

been expelled fifty years ago? He didn’t want to be the

one who brought it all up again.

As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go

and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious

worry was added to Harry’s growing list. He had just

set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet

again —

“ Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear ...”

He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both

jumped away from him in alarm.

“The voice!” said Harry, looking over his shoulder. “I

just heard it again — didn’t you?”

Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however,

clapped a hand to her forehead.

“Harry — I think I’ve just understood something! I’ve

got to go to the library!”

And she sprinted away, up the stairs.

“ What does she understand?” said Harry distractedly,

still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had

come from.

“Loads more than I do,” said Ron, shaking his head.

“But why’s she got to go to the library?”

“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron,

shrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library.”

Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice

again, but people were now emerging from the Great

 

Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the

front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.

“You’d better get moving,” said Ron. “It’s nearly eleven

— the match — ”

Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his

Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd

swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still

in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he

pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his

only comfort was that everyone was now outside to

watch the game.

The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous

applause. Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight

around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the

balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow,

were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute

discussion of tactics.

Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor

McGonagall came half marching, half running across

the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.

Harry’s heart dropped like a stone.

“This match has been canceled,” Professor

McGonagall called through the megaphone,

addressing the packed stadium. There were boos and

shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and

ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off

his broomstick.

“But, Professor!” he shouted. “We’ve got to play — the

Cup — Gryffindor — ”

Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to

shout through her megaphone:

 

“All students are to make their way back to the House

common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give

them further information. As quickly as you can,

please!”

Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned

Harry over to her.

“Potter, I think you’d better come with me. ...”

Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this

time, Harry saw Ron detach himself from the

complaining crowd; he came running up to them as

they set off toward the castle. To Harry’s surprise,

Professor McGonagall didn’t object.

“Yes, perhaps you’d better come, too, Weasley. ...”

Some of the students swarming around them were

grumbling about the match being canceled; others

looked worried. Harry and Ron followed Professor

McGonagall back into the school and up the marble

staircase. But they weren’t taken to anybody’s office

this time.

“This will be a bit of a shock,” said Professor

McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they

approached the infirmary. “There has been another

attack ... another double attack.”

Harry’s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor

McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron

entered.

Madam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth-year girl

with long, curly hair. Harry recognized her as the

Ravenclaw they’d accidentally asked for directions to

the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to

her was —

 

“HermioneY’ Ron groaned.

Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.

“They were found near the library,” said Professor

McGonagall. “I don’t suppose either of you can

explain this? It was on the floor next to them. ...”

She was holding up a small, circular mirror.

Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at

Hermione.

“I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,” said

Professor McGonagall heavily. “I need to address the

students in any case.”

“All students will return to their House common

rooms by six o’clock in the evening. No student is to

leave the dormitories after that time. You will be

escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to

use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All

further Quidditch training and matches are to be

postponed. There will be no more evening activities.”

The Gryffindors packed inside the common room

listened to Professor McGonagall in silence. She rolled

up the parchment from which she had been reading

and said in a somewhat choked voice, “I need hardly

add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely

that the school will be closed unless the culprit

behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone

who thinks they might know anything about them to

come forward.”

She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait

hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately.

 

“That’s two Gryffindors down, not counting a

Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff,”

said the Weasley twins’ friend Lee Jordan, counting

on his fingers. “Haven’t any of the teachers noticed

that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn’t it obvious all this

stuff’s coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin,

the monster of Slytherin — why don’t they just chuck

all the Slytherins out?” he roared, to nods and

scattered applause.

Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but

for once he didn’t seem keen to make his views heard.

He was looking pale and stunned.

“Percy’s in shock,” George told Harry quietly. “That

Ravenclaw girl — Penelope Clearwater — she’s a

prefect. I don’t think he thought the monster would

dare attack a prefect.”

But Harry was only half-listening. He didn’t seem to

be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on

the hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if

the culprit wasn’t caught soon, he was looking at a

lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had

turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the

prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed.

Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.

“What’re we going to do?” said Ron quietly in Harry’s

ear. “D’you think they suspect Hagrid?”

“We’ve got to go and talk to him,” said Harry, making

up his mind. “I can’t believe it’s him this time, but if

he set the monster loose last time he’ll know how to

get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.”

“But McGonagall said we’ve got to stay in our tower

unless we’re in class — ”

 

“I think,” said Harry, more quietly still, “it’s time to

get my dad’s old cloak out again.”

Harry had inherited just one thing from his father: a

long and silvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only

chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid

without anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at

the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and

Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of

Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed

again, and threw the cloak over themselves.

The journey through the dark and deserted castle

corridors wasn’t enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered

the castle at night several times before, had never

seen it so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects,

and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs,

staring around for any unusual activity. Their

Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop them making any noise,

and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron

stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape

stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at

almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with

relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased

them open.

It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the

lit windows of Hagrid ’s house and pulled off the cloak

only when they were right outside his front door.

Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open.

They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a

crossbow at them. Fang the boarhound barked loudly

behind him.

“Oh,” he said, lowering the weapon and staring at

them. “What ’re you two doin’ here?”

 

“What’s that for?” said Harry, pointing at the

crossbow as they stepped inside.

“Nothin’ — nothin’ — “ Hagrid muttered. “I’ve bin

expectin’ — doesn’ matter — Sit down — I’ll make tea

He hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He

nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the

kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a

nervous jerk of his massive hand.

“Are you okay, Hagrid?” said Harry. “Did you hear

about Hermione?”

“Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said Hagrid, a slight break in

his voice.

He kept glancing nervously at the windows. He

poured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had

forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab

of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock

on the door.

Hagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron

exchanged panic-stricken looks, then threw the

Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated

into a corner. Hagrid checked that they were hidden,

seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once

more.

“Good evening, Hagrid.”

It was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly

serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-

looking man.

The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious

expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of

 

clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black

cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he

carried a lime-green bowler.

“That’s Dad’s boss!” Ron breathed. “Cornelius Fudge,

the Minister of Magic!”

Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.

Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into

one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to

Cornelius Fudge.

“Bad business, Hagrid,” said Fudge in rather clipped

tones. “Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks

on Muggle-borns. Things’ve gone far enough.

Ministry’s got to act.”

“I never,” said Hagrid, looking imploringly at

Dumbledore. “You know I never, Professor

Dumbledore, sir — ”

“I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my

full confidence,” said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.

“Look, Albus,” said Fudge, uncomfortably. “Hagrid’s

record’s against him. Ministry’s got to do something

— the school governors have been in touch — ”

“Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid

away will not help in the slightest,” said Dumbledore.

His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen

before.

“Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge,

fidgeting with his bowler. “I’m under a lot of pressure.

Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it

wasn’t Hagrid, he’ll be back and no more said. But

 

I’ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn’t be doing my

duty — ”

“Take me?” said Hagrid, who was trembling. “Take me

where?”

“For a short stretch only,” said Fudge, not meeting

Hagrid ’s eyes. “Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a

precaution. If someone else is caught, you’ll be let out

with a full apology — ”

“Not Azkaban?” croaked Hagrid.

Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud

rap on the door.

Dumbledore answered it. It was Harry’s turn for an

elbow in the ribs; he’d let out an audible gasp.

Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid’s hut, swathed

in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and

satisfied smile. Fang started to growl.

“Already here, Fudge,” he said approvingly. “Good,

good...”

“What’re you doin’ here?” said Hagrid furiously. “Get

outta my house!”

“My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure

at all in being inside your — er — d’you call this a

house?” said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked

around the small cabin. “I simply called at the school

and was told that the headmaster was here.”

“And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?”

said Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was

still blazing in his blue eyes.

 

“ Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,” said Malfoy lazily,

taking out a long roll of parchment, “but the

governors feel it’s time for you to step aside. This is

an Order of Suspension — you’ll find all twelve

signatures on it. I’m afraid we feel you’re losing your

touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two

more this afternoon, wasn’t it? At this rate, there’ll be

no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know

what an awful loss that would be to the school.”

“Oh, now, see here, Lucius,” said Fudge, looking

alarmed, “Dumbledore suspended — no, no — last

thing we want just now — ”

“The appointment — or suspension — of the

headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,”

said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. “And as Dumbledore has

failed to stop these attacks — ”

“See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can’t stop them,”

said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, “I

mean to say, who can?”

“That remains to be seen,” said Mr. Malfoy with a

nasty smile. “But as all twelve of us have voted — ”

Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing

the ceiling.

“An’ how many did yeh have ter threaten an’

blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?” he roared.

“Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead

you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,” said Mr.

Malfoy. “I would advise you not to shout at the

Azkaban guards like that. They won’t like it at all.”

“Yeh can’ take Dumbledore!” yelled Hagrid, making

Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his

 

basket. “Take him away, an’ the Muggle-borns won’

stand a chance! There’ll be killin’ next!”

“Calm yourself, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore sharply. He

looked at Lucius Malfoy.

“If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of

course step aside — ”

“But — ” stuttered Fudge.

“iVo!” growled Hagrid.

Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off

Lucius Malfoy’s cold gray ones.

“However,” said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly

and clearly so that none of them could miss a word,

“you will find that I will only truly have left this school

when none here are loyal to me. You will also find

that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those

who ask for it.”

For a second, Harry was almost sure Dumbledore’s

eyes flickered toward the corner where he and Ron

stood hidden.

“Admirable sentiments,” said Malfoy, bowing. “We

shall all miss your — er — highly individual way of

running things, Albus, and only hope that your

successor will manage to prevent any — ah — killins.”

He strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed

Dumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler,

waited for Hagrid to go ahead of him, but Hagrid

stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said

carefully, “If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff,

all they’d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders.

That’d lead ’em right! That’s all I’m sayin’.”

 

Fudge stared at him in amazement.

“All right, I’m cornin’,” said Hagrid, pulling on his

moleskin overcoat. But as he was about to follow

Fudge through the door, he stopped again and said

loudly, “An’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang while I’m

away.”

The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the

Invisibility Cloak.

“We’re in trouble now,” he said hoarsely. “No

Dumbledore. They might as well close the school

tonight. There’ll be an attack a day with him gone.”

Fang started howling, scratching at the closed door.

 

ARAGOG

Summer was creeping over the grounds around the

castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and

flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the

greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the

castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his

heels, the scene didn’t look right to Harry; no better,

in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things

were so horribly wrong.

Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but

visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.

“We’re taking no more chances,” Madam Pomfrey told

them severely through a crack in the infirmary door.

“No, I’m sorry, there’s every chance the attacker might

come back to finish these people off. ...”

With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never

before, so that the sun warming the castle walls

outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows.

There was barely a face to be seen in the school that

didn’t look worried and tense, and any laughter that

 

rang through the corridors sounded shrill and

unnatural and was quickly stifled.

Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore’s final words

to himself. “I will only truly have left this school when

none here are loyal to me. . . . Help will always be given

at Hog warts to those who ask for it.” But what good

were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to

ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and

scared as they were?

Hagrid’s hint about the spiders was far easier to

understand — the trouble was, there didn’t seem to

be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry

looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly)

by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact

that they weren’t allowed to wander off on their own

but had to move around the castle in a pack with the

other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students

seemed glad that they were being shepherded from

class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very

irksome.

One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly

enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion.

Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as

though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry

didn’t realize what he was so pleased about until the

Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and

Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy,

Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.

“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid

of Dumbledore,” he said, not troubling to keep his

voice down. “I told you he thinks Dumbledore’s the

worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll

get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t

want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall

won’t last long, she’s only filling in. ...”

 

Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about

Hermione’s empty seat and cauldron.

“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t you apply for

the headmaster’s job?”

“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t

suppress a thin-lipped smile. “Professor Dumbledore

has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay

he’ll be back with us soon enough.”

“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I expect you’d

have Father’s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the

job — I’ll tell Father you’re the best teacher here, sir

Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon,

fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was

pretending to vomit into his cauldron.

“I’m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven’t all packed

their bags by now,” Malfoy went on. “Bet you five

Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn’t Granger — ”

The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at

Malfoy’s last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in

the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts

to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.

“Let me at him,” Ron growled as Harry and Dean

hung onto his arms. “I don’t care, I don’t need my

wand, I’m going to kill him with my bare hands — ”

“Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,”

barked Snape over the class’s heads, and off they

marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the

rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only safe to

let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the

 

castle and they were making their way across the

vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.

The Herbology class was very subdued; there were

now two missing from their number, Justin and

Hermione.

Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the

Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of

withered stalks onto the compost heap and found

himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took

a deep breath and said, very formally, “I just want to

say, Harry, that I’m sorry I ever suspected you. I

know you’d never attack Hermione Granger, and I

apologize for all the stuff I said. We’re all in the same

boat now, and, well — ”

He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.

Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the

same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron.

“That Draco Malfoy character,” said Ernie, breaking

off dead twigs, “he seems very pleased about all this,

doesn’t he? D’you know, I think he might be

Slytherin’s heir.”

“That’s clever of you,” said Ron, who didn’t seem to

have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry.

“Do you think it’s Malfoy, Harry?” Ernie asked.

“No,” said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah

stared.

A second later, Harry spotted something.

Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground

on the other side of the glass, moving in an

 

unnaturally straight line as though taking the

shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit

Ron over the hand with his pruning shears.

“Ouch\ What ’re you — ”

Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress

with his eyes screwed up against the sun.

“Oh, yeah,” said Ron, trying, and failing, to look

pleased. “But we can’t follow them now — ”

Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously.

Harry’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If

they pursued their fixed course, there could be no

doubt about where they would end up.

“Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest.

And Ron looked even unhappier about that.

At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the

class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.

Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could

talk out of earshot.

“Well have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,” Harry

told Ron. “We can take Fang with us. He’s used to

going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some

help.”

“Right,” said Ron, who was twirling his wand

nervously in his fingers. “Er — aren’t there — aren’t

there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?” he

added as they took their usual places at the back of

Lockhart’s classroom.

 

Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said,

“There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are

all right, and the unicorns ...”

Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before.

Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never

to do so again.

Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared

at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking

grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing

short of buoyant.

“Come now,” he cried, beaming around him. “Why all

these long faces?”

People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody

answered.

“Don’t you people realize,” said Lockhart, speaking

slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, “the danger

has passed! The culprit has been taken away — ”

“Says who?” said Dean Thomas loudly.

“My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn’t

have taken Hagrid if he hadn’t been one hundred

percent sure that he was guilty,” said Lockhart, in the

tone of someone explaining that one and one made

two.

“Oh, yes he would,” said Ron, even more loudly than

Dean.

“I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid ’s

arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,” said Lockhart in a

self-satisfied tone.

 

Ron started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow,

but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him

hard under the desk.

“We weren’t there, remember?” Harry muttered.

But Lockhart’s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that

he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his

confidence that the whole business was now at an

end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw

Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart’s stupid face.

Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to

Ron: Let’s do it tonight

Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked

sideways at the empty seat usually filled by

Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and

he nodded.

The Gryffindor common room was always very

crowded these days, because from six o’clock onward

the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had

plenty to talk about, with the result that the common

room often didn’t empty until past midnight.

Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his

trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting

on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George

challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of

Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very

subdued in Hermione ’s usual chair. Harry and Ron

kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games

quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when

Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.

Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two

dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak,

 

throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the

portrait hole.

It was another difficult journey through the castle,

dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the

entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front

doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any

creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.

“ ’Course,” said Ron abruptly as they strode across

the black grass, “we might get to the forest and find

there’s nothing to follow. Those spiders might not’ve

been going there at all. I know it looked like they were

moving in that sort of general direction, but ...”

His voice trailed away hopefully.

They reached Hagrid’s house, sad and sorry-looking

with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door

open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them.

Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his

deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle

toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his

teeth together.

Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid’s table.

There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.

“C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said Harry,

patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the

house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest,

and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.

Harry took out his wand, murmured, “Lumos\” and a

tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let

them watch the path for signs of spiders.

“Good thinking,” said Ron. “I’d light mine, too, but

you know — it’d probably blow up or something. ...”

 

Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the

grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from

the wandlight into the shade of the trees.

“Okay,” Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst,

“I’m ready. Let’s go.”

So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree

roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow

of Harry’s wand, they followed the steady trickle of

spiders moving along the path. They walked behind

them for about twenty minutes, not speaking,

listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs

and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become

thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no

longer visible, and Harry’s wand shone alone in the

sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the

path.

Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were

going, but everything outside his little sphere of light

was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the

forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid

advising him not to leave the forest path last time

he’d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now,

probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also

said to follow the spiders.

Something wet touched Harry’s hand and he jumped

backward, crushing Ron’s foot, but it was only Fang’s

nose.

“What d’you reckon?” Harry said to Ron, whose eyes

he could just make out, reflecting the light from his

wand.

“We’ve come this far,” said Ron.

 

So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders

into the trees. They couldn’t move very quickly now;

there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely

visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang’s

hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to

stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the

spiders in the wandlight.

They walked for what seemed like at least half an

hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and

brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground

seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees

were as thick as ever.

Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark,

making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins.

“What?” said Ron loudly, looking around into the

pitch-dark, and gripping Harry’s elbow very hard.

“There’s something moving over there,” Harry

breathed. “Listen ... sounds like something big. ...”

They listened. Some distance to their right, the

something big was snapping branches as it carved a

path through the trees.

“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh — ”

“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.”

“Hear me?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice.

“It’s already heard Fang!”

The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs

as they stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange

rumbling noise and then silence.

“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry.

 

“Probably getting ready to pounce,” said Ron.

They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.

“D’you think it’s gone?” Harry whispered.

“Dunno — ”

Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so

bright in the darkness that both of them flung up

their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried

to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped

even louder.

“Harry!” Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief.

“Harry, it’s our car!”

“What?”

“Come on!”

Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling

and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged

into a clearing.

Mr. Weasley’s car was standing, empty, in the middle

of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense

branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked,

openmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him,

exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.

“It’s been here all the time!” said Ron delightedly,

walking around the car. “Look at it. The forest’s

turned it wild. ...”

The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with

mud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the

forest on its own. Fang didn’t seem at all keen on it;

he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering.

 

His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his

wand back into his robes.

“And we thought it was going to attack us!” said Ron,

leaning against the car and patting it. “I wondered

where it had gone!”

Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for

signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away

from the glare of the headlights.

“We’ve lost the trail,” he said. “C’mon, let’s go and find

them.”

Ron didn’t speak. He didn’t move. His eyes were fixed

on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right

behind Harry. His face was livid with terror.

Harry didn’t even have time to turn around. There

was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt

something long and hairy seize him around the

middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was

hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard

more clicking, and saw Ron’s legs leave the ground,

too, heard Fang whimpering and howling — next

moment, he was being swept away into the dark

trees.

Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him

was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the

front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining

black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of

the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were

moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could

hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third

monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn’t have

yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left

his voice back with the car in the clearing.

 

He never knew how long he was in the creature’s

clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly

lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn

ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his

neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the

ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared

of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the

worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.

Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the

leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-

eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive

specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down

the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very

center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all

around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight

of its load.

Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider

released him. Ron and Fang thudded down next to

him. Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but cowering

silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt.

His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent

scream and his eyes were popping.

Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had

dropped him was saying something. It had been hard

to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word

he spoke.

“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!”

And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a

spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very

slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and

legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head

was milky white. He was blind.

“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.

 

“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.

“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight

milky eyes wandering vaguely.

“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.

“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping.

“We’re friends of Hagrid ’s,” Harry shouted. His heart

seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat.

Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all

around the hollow.

Aragog paused.

“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,”

he said slowly.

“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast.

“That’s why we’ve come.”

“In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought

he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. “But

why has he sent you?”

Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided

against it; he didn’t think his legs would support him.

So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could.

“They think, up at the school, that Hagrid’s been

setting a — a — something on students. They’ve

taken him to Azkaban.”

Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around

the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of

 

spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn’t

usually make Harry feel sick with fear.

“But that was years ago,” said Aragog fretfully. “Years

and years ago. I remember it well. That’s why they

made him leave the school. They believed that I was

the monster that dwells in what they call the

Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had

opened the Chamber and set me free.”

“And you ... you didn’t come from the Chamber of

Secrets?” said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his

forehead.

“I!” said Aragog, clicking angrily. “I was not born in

the castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave

me to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was only a

boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the

castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid is

my good friend, and a good man. When I was

discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he

protected me. I have lived here in the forest ever

since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me

a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown,

all through Hagrid ’s goodness. ...”

Harry summoned what remained of his courage.

“So you never — never attacked anyone?”

“Never,” croaked the old spider. “It would have been

my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never

harmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed

was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of

the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our

kind like the dark and the quiet. ...”

 

“But then . . . Do you know what did kill that girl?”

said Harry. “Because whatever it is, it’s back and

attacking people again — ”

His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of

clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting

angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him.

“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an

ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well

do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go,

when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”

“What is it?” said Harry urgently.

More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed

to be closing in.

“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do

not name it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that

dread creature, though he asked me, many times.”

Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the

spiders pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to

be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into his

domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch

slowly toward Harry and Ron.

“Well just go, then,” Harry called desperately to

Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him.

“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. ...”

“But — but — ”

“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my

command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when

it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye,

friend of Hagrid.”

 

Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him,

was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes

gleaming in their ugly black heads.

Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was

no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried

to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note

sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the

hollow.

Mr. Weasley’s car was thundering down the slope,

headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking

spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs,

their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched

to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew

open.

“Get Fang!” Harry yelled, diving into the front seat;

Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and

threw him, yelping, into the back of the car — the

doors slammed shut — Ron didn’t touch the

accelerator but the car didn’t need him; the engine

roared and they were off, hitting more spiders. They

sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were

soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping

the windows as the car wound its way cleverly

through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously

knew.

Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still

open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren’t

popping anymore.

“Are you okay?”

Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak.

They smashed their way through the undergrowth,

Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw

 

the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large

oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned,

and Harry could again see patches of sky.

The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly

thrown into the windshield. They had reached the

edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in

his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the

door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid’s house,

tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a

minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his

limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring.

Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back

into the forest and disappeared from view.

Harry went back into Hagrid’s cabin to get the

Invisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a

blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again,

he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin

patch.

“Follow the spiders,” said Ron weakly, wiping his

mouth on his sleeve. “I’ll never forgive Hagrid. We’re

lucky to be alive.”

“I bet he thought Aragog wouldn’t hurt friends of his,”

said Harry.

“That’s exactly Hagrid’s problem!” said Ron, thumping

the wall of the cabin. “He always thinks monsters

aren’t as bad as they’re made out, and look where it’s

got him! A cell in Azkaban!” He was shivering

uncontrollably now. “What was the point of sending

us in there? What have we found out, I’d like to

know?”

“That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,”

said Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding

him in the arm to make him walk. “He was innocent.”

 

Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in

a cupboard wasn’t his idea of being innocent.

As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak

to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the

creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back

across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase,

holding their breath as they passed corridors where

watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached

the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the

fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off

the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their

dormitory.

Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get

undressed. Harry, however, didn’t feel very sleepy. He

sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about

everything Aragog had said.

The creature that was lurking somewhere in the

castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster

Voldemort — even other monsters didn’t want to

name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out

what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even

Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of

Secrets.

Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned

back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting

at him through the tower window.

He couldn’t see what else they could do. They had hit

dead ends everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong

person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one

could tell whether it was the same person, or a

different one, who had opened the Chamber this time.

There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still

thinking about what Aragog had said.

 

He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like

their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly

sat bolt upright.

“Ron,” he hissed through the dark, “Ron — ”

Ron woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly

around, and saw Harry.

“Ron — that girl who died. Aragog said she was found

in a bathroom,” said Harry, ignoring Neville’s

snuffling snores from the corner. “What if she never

left the bathroom? What if she’s still there?”

Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight.

And then he understood, too.

“You don’t think — not Moaning Myrtle ?”

 

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

All those times we were in that bathroom, and she

was just three toilets away,” said Ron bitterly at

breakfast next day, “and we could’ve asked her, and

now ...”

It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders.

Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a

girls’ bathroom, the girls’ bathroom, moreover, right

next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be

almost impossible.

But something happened in their first lesson,

Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets

out of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten

minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told

them that their exams would start on the first of

June, one week from today.

“Exams?” howled Seamus Finnigan. “We’re still

getting exams?”

 

There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville

Longbottom’s wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs

on his desk. Professor McGonagall restored it with a

wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to

Seamus.

“The whole point of keeping the school open at this

time is for you to receive your education,” she said

sternly. “The exams will therefore take place as usual,

and I trust you are all studying hard.”

Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that

there would be exams with the castle in this state.

There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around

the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl

even more darkly.

“Professor Dumbledore’s instructions were to keep the

school running as normally as possible,” she said.

“And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out

how much you have learned this year.”

Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was

supposed to be turning into slippers. What had he

learned so far this year? He couldn’t seem to think of

anything that would be useful in an exam.

Ron looked as though he’d just been told he had to go

and live in the Forbidden Forest.

“Can you imagine me taking exams with this?” he

asked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just

started whistling loudly.

Three days before their first exam, Professor

McGonagall made another announcement at

breakfast.

 

“I have good news,” she said, and the Great Hall,

instead of falling silent, erupted.

“Dumbledore’s coming back!” several people yelled

joyfully.

“You’ve caught the Heir of Slytherin!” squealed a girl

at the Ravenclaw table.

“Quidditch matches are back on!” roared Wood

excitedly.

When the hubbub had subsided, Professor

McGonagall said, “Professor Sprout has informed me

that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last.

Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who

have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that

one of them may well be able to tell us who, or what,

attacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year

will end with our catching the culprit.”

There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over

at the Slytherin table and wasn’t at all surprised to

see that Draco Malfoy hadn’t joined in. Ron, however,

was looking happier than he’d looked in days.

“It won’t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!” he

said to Harry. “Hermione’ll probably have all the

answers when they wake her up! Mind you, she’ll go

crazy when she finds out we’ve got exams in three

days’ time. She hasn’t studied. It might be kinder to

leave her where she is till they’re over.”

Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down

next to Ron. She looked tense and nervous, and Harry

noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap.

“What’s up?” said Ron, helping himself to more

porridge.

 

Ginny didn’t say anything, but glanced up and down

the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face

that reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn’t

think who.

“Spit it out,” said Ron, watching her.

Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She

was rocking backward and forward slightly in her

chair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering

on the edge of revealing forbidden information.

“I’ve got to tell you something,” Ginny mumbled,

carefully not looking at Harry.

“What is it?” said Harry.

Ginny looked as though she couldn’t find the right

words.

“What?” said Ron.

Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only

Ginny and Ron could hear him.

“Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have

you seen something? Someone acting oddly?”

Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise

moment, Percy Weasley appeared, looking tired and

wan.

“If you’ve finished eating, I’ll take that seat, Ginny. I’m

starving, I’ve only just come off patrol duty.”

Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been

electrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and

 

scampered away. Percy sat down and grabbed a mug

from the center of the table.

“Percy!” said Ron angrily. “She was just about to tell

us something important!”

Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.

“What sort of thing?” he said, coughing.

“I just asked her if she’d seen anything odd, and she

started to say — ”

“Oh — that — that’s nothing to do with the Chamber

of Secrets,” said Percy at once.

“How do you know?” said Ron, his eyebrows raised.

“Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on

me the other day when I was — well, never mind —

the point is, she spotted me doing something and I,

um, I asked her not to mention it to anybody. I must

say, I did think she’d keep her word. It’s nothing,

really, I’d just rather — ”

Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.

“What were you doing, Percy?” said Ron, grinning.

“Go on, tell us, we won’t laugh.”

Percy didn’t smile back.

“Pass me those rolls, Harry, I’m starving.”

Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved

tomorrow without their help, but he wasn’t about to

pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up —

and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were

being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.

 

Lockhart, who had so often assured them that all

danger had passed, only to be proved wrong right

away, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was

hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the

corridors. His hair wasn’t as sleek as usual; it seemed

he had been up most of the night, patrolling the

fourth floor.

“Mark my words,” he said, ushering them around a

corner. “The first words out of those poor Petrified

people’s mouths will be ‘It was Hagrid.’ Frankly, I’m

astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these

security measures are necessary.”

“I agree, sir,” said Harry, making Ron drop his books

in surprise.

“Thank you, Harry,” said Lockhart graciously while

they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. “I

mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on

with, without walking students to classes and

standing guard all night. ...”

“That’s right,” said Ron, catching on. “Why don’t you

leave us here, sir, we’ve only got one more corridor to

go-”

“You know, Weasley, I think I will,” said Lockhart. “I

really should go and prepare my next class — ”

And he hurried off.

“Prepare his class,” Ron sneered after him. “Gone to

curl his hair, more like.”

They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of

them, then darted down a side passage and hurried

off toward Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. But just as

 

they were congratulating each other on their brilliant

scheme —

“Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?”

It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the

thinnest of thin lines.

“We were — we were — ” Ron stammered. “We were

going to — to go and see — ”

“Hermione,” said Harry. Ron and Professor

McGonagall both looked at him.

“We haven’t seen her for ages, Professor,” Harry went

on hurriedly, treading on Ron’s foot, “and we thought

we’d sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell

her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to

worry — ”

Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for

a moment, Harry thought she was going to explode,

but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky

voice.

“Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear

glistening in her beady eye. “Of course, I realize this

has all been hardest on the friends of those who have

been ... I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you

may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns

where you’ve gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given

my permission.”

Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe

that they’d avoided detention. As they turned the

corner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall

blow her nose.

 

“That,” said Ron fervently, “was the best story you’ve

ever come up with.”

They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing

and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor

McGonagall’s permission to visit Hermione.

Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.

“There’s just no point talking to a Petrified person,”

she said, and they had to admit she had a point when

they’d taken their seats next to Hermione. It was

plain that Hermione didn’t have the faintest inkling

that she had visitors, and that they might just as well

tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it

would do.

“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said

Ron, looking sadly at Hermione ’s rigid face. “Because

if he sneaked up on them all, no one’ll ever know. ...”

But Harry wasn’t looking at Hermione’s face. He was

more interested in her right hand. It lay clenched on

top of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a

piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.

Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near,

he pointed this out to Ron.

“Try and get it out,” Ron whispered, shifting his chair

so that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey’s view.

It was no easy task. Hermione’s hand was clamped so

tightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was

going to tear it. While Ron kept watch he tugged and

twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the

paper came free.

 

It was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry

smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read

it, too.

Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam

our land, there is none more curious or more deadly

than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents.

This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live

many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken’s egg,

hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are

most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and

venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare,

and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall

suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk,

for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only

from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.

And beneath this, a single word had been written, in

a hand Harry recognized as Hermione’s. Pipes.

It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on

in his brain.

“Ron,” he breathed. “This is it. This is the answer. The

monster in the Chamber’s a basilisk — a giant

serpent! That’s why I’ve been hearing that voice all

over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It’s

because I understand Parseltongue. ...”

Harry looked up at the beds around him.

“The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no

one’s died — because no one looked it straight in the

eye. Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk

burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got

Petrified. Justin ... Justin must’ve seen the basilisk

through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast

 

of it, but he couldn’t die again ... and Hermione and

that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next

to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was

a basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first

person she met to look around corners with a mirror

first! And that girl pulled out her mirror — and — ”

Ron’s jaw had dropped.

“And Mrs. Norris?” he whispered eagerly.

Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night

of Halloween.

“The water ...” he said slowly. “The flood from

Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris

only saw the reflection. ...”

He scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more

he looked at it, the more it made sense.

"... The crowing of the rooster ... is fatal to if!” he read

aloud. “Hagrid’s roosters were killed! The Heir of

Slytherin didn’t want one anywhere near the castle

once the Chamber was opened! Spiders flee before it\

It all fits!”

“But how’s the basilisk been getting around the

place?” said Ron. “A giant snake ... Someone would’ve

seen ...”

Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had

scribbled at the foot of the page.

“Pipes,” he said. “Pipes ... Ron, it’s been using the

plumbing. I’ve been hearing that voice inside the

walls. ...”

Ron suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm.

 

“The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!” he said

hoarsely. “What if it’s a bathroom? What if it’s in — ”

“ — Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom,” said Harry.

They sat there, excitement coursing through them,

hardly able to believe it.

“This means,” said Harry, “I can’t be the only

Parselmouth in the school. The Heir of Slytherin’s

one, too. That’s how he’s been controlling the

basilisk.”

“What’re we going to do?” said Ron, whose eyes were

flashing. “Should we go straight to McGonagall?”

“Let’s go to the staffroom,” said Harry, jumping up.

“She’ll be there in ten minutes. It’s nearly break.”

They ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered

hanging around in another corridor, they went

straight into the deserted staffroom. It was a large,

paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. Harry and

Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down.

But the bell to signal break never came.

Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor

McGonagall’s voice, magically magnified.

“All students to return to their House dormitories at

once. All teachers return to the staffroom. Immediately,

please.”

Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron.

“Not another attack? Not now?”

 

“What’ll we do?” said Ron, aghast. “Go back to the

dormitory?”

“No,” said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly

sort of wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers’

cloaks. “In here. Let’s hear what it’s all about. Then

we can tell them what we’ve found out.”

They hid themselves inside it, listening to the

rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and

the staffroom door banging open. From between the

musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers

filtering into the room. Some of them were looking

puzzled, others downright scared. Then Professor

McGonagall arrived.

“It has happened,” she told the silent staffroom. “A

student has been taken by the monster. Right into

the Chamber itself.”

Professor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout

clapped her hands over her mouth. Snape gripped the

back of a chair very hard and said, “How can you be

sure?”

“The Heir of Slytherin,” said Professor McGonagall,

who was very white, “left another message. Right

underneath the first one. ‘Her skeleton will lie in the

Chamber forever.’ ”

Professor Flitwick burst into tears.

“Who is it?” said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-

kneed, into a chair. “Which student?”

“Ginny Weasley,” said Professor McGonagall.

Harry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe

floor beside him.

 

“We shall have to send all the students home

tomorrow,” said Professor McGonagall. “This is the

end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always said ...”

The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild

moment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore.

But it was Lockhart, and he was beaming.

“So sorry — dozed off — what have I missed?”

He didn’t seem to notice that the other teachers were

looking at him with something remarkably like

hatred. Snape stepped forward.

“Just the man,” he said. “The very man. A girl has

been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into

the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come

at last.”

Lockhart blanched.

“That’s right, Gilderoy,” chipped in Professor Sprout.

“Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known

all along where the entrance to the Chamber of

Secrets is?”

“I — well, I — ” sputtered Lockhart.

“Yes, didn’t you tell me you were sure you knew what

was inside it?” piped up Professor Flitwick.

“D-did I? I don’t recall — ”

“I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you

hadn’t had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was

arrested,” said Snape. “Didn’t you say that the whole

affair had been bungled, and that you should have

been given a free rein from the first?”

 

Lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.

“I — I really never — you may have misunderstood — ”

“Well leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,” said Professor

McGonagall. “Tonight will be an excellent time to do

it. Well make sure everyone’s out of your way. You’ll

be able to tackle the monster all by yourself. A free

rein at last.”

Lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody

came to the rescue. He didn’t look remotely handsome

anymore. His lip was trembling, and in the absence of

his usually toothy grin, he looked weak-chinned and

feeble.

“V-very well,” he said. “I’ll — I’ll be in my office,

getting — getting ready.”

And he left the room.

“Right,” said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils

were flared, “that’s got him out from under our feet.

The Heads of Houses should go and inform their

students what has happened. Tell them the Hogwarts

Express will take them home first thing tomorrow.

Will the rest of you please make sure no students

have been left outside their dormitories.”

The teachers rose and left, one by one.

It was probably the worst day of Harry’s entire life.

He, Ron, Fred, and George sat together in a corner of

the Gryffindor common room, unable to say anything

to each other. Percy wasn’t there. He had gone to

send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut

himself up in his dormitory.

 

No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had

Gryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet.

Near sunset, Fred and George went up to bed, unable

to sit there any longer.

“She knew something, Harry,” said Ron, speaking for

the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in

the staffroom. “That’s why she was taken. It wasn’t

some stupid thing about Percy at all. She’d found out

something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must

be why she was — ” Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. “I

mean, she was a pureblood. There can’t be any other

reason.”

Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the

skyline. This was the worst he had ever felt. If only

there was something they could do. Anything.

“Harry,” said Ron. “D’you think there’s any chance at

all she’s not — you know — ”

Harry didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t see how

Ginny could still be alive.

“D’you know what?” said Ron. “I think we should go

and see Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He’s going

to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him

where we think it is, and tell him it’s a basilisk in

there.”

Because Harry couldn’t think of anything else to do,

and because he wanted to be doing something, he

agreed. The Gryffindors around them were so

miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that

nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the

room, and left through the portrait hole.

Darkness was falling as they walked down to

Lockhart’s office. There seemed to be a lot of activity

 

going on inside it. They could hear scraping, thumps,

and hurried footsteps.

Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from

inside. Then the door opened the tiniest crack and

they saw one of Lockhart’s eyes peering through it.

“Oh — Mr. Potter — Mr. Weasley — ” he said, opening

the door a bit wider. “I’m rather busy at the moment

— if you would be quick — ”

“Professor, we’ve got some information for you,” said

Harry. “We think it’ll help you.”

“Er — well — it’s not terribly — ” The side of

Lockhart’s face that they could see looked very

uncomfortable. “I mean — well — all right — ”

He opened the door and they entered.

His office had been almost completely stripped. Two

large trunks stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-

green, lilac, midnight-blue, had been hastily folded

into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into

the other. The photographs that had covered the walls

were now crammed into boxes on the desk.

“Are you going somewhere?” said Harry.

“Er, well, yes,” said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster

of himself from the back of the door as he spoke and

starting to roll it up. “Urgent call — unavoidable —

got to go — ”

“What about my sister?” said Ron jerkily.

“Well, as to that — most unfortunate — ” said

Lockhart, avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open a

 

drawer and started emptying the contents into a bag.

“No one regrets more than I — ”

“You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!”

said Harry. “You can’t go now! Not with all the Dark

stuff going on here!”

“Well — I must say — when I took the job — ”

Lockhart muttered, now piling socks on top of his

robes, “nothing in the job description — didn’t expect

“You mean you’re running away? said Harry

disbelievingly. “After all that stuff you did in your

books — ”

“Books can be misleading,” said Lockhart delicately.

“You wrote them!” Harry shouted.

“My dear boy,” said Lockhart, straightening up and

frowning at Harry. “Do use your common sense. My

books wouldn’t have sold half as well if people didn’t

think I’d done all those things. No one wants to read

about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did

save a village from werewolves. He’d look dreadful on

the front cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch

who banished the Bandon Banshee had a hairy chin.

I mean, come on — ”

“So you’ve just been taking credit for what a load of

other people have done?” said Harry incredulously.

“Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, shaking his head

impatiently, “it’s not nearly as simple as that. There

was work involved. I had to track these people down.

Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they

did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so

they wouldn’t remember doing it. If there’s one thing I

 

pride myself on, it’s my Memory Charms. No, it’s been

a lot of work, Harry. It’s not all book signings and

publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you have

to be prepared for a long hard slog.”

He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked

them.

“Let’s see,” he said. “I think that’s everything. Yes.

Only one thing left.”

He pulled out his wand and turned to them.

“Awfully sorry, boys, but I’ll have to put a Memory

Charm on you now. Can’t have you blabbing my

secrets all over the place. I’d never sell another book

Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had

barely raised his, when Harry bellowed,

“ Expelliarmus\ ”

Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his

trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it,

and flung it out of the open window.

“Shouldn’t have let Professor Snape teach us that

one,” said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk

aside. Lockhart was looking up at him, feeble once

more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him.

“What d’you want me to do?” said Lockhart weakly. “I

don’t know where the Chamber of Secrets is. There’s

nothing I can do.”

“You’re in luck,” said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his

feet at wandpoint. “We think we know where it is.

And what’s inside it. Let’s go.”

 

They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the

nearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the

messages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning

Myrtle’s bathroom.

They sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see

that he was shaking.

Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end

toilet.

“Oh, it’s you,” she said when she saw Harry. “What do

you want this time?”

“To ask you how you died,” said Harry.

Myrtle’s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as

though she had never been asked such a flattering

question.

“Ooooh, it was dreadful,” she said with relish. “It

happened right in here. I died in this very stall. I

remember it so well. I’d hidden because Olive Hornby

was teasing me about my glasses. The door was

locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody

come in. They said something funny. A different

language, I think it must have been. Anyway, what

really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I

unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own

toilet, and then — ” Myrtle swelled importantly, her

face shining. “I died.”

“How?” said Harry.

“No idea,” said Myrtle in hushed tones. “I just

remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. My

whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating

away. ...” She looked dreamily at Harry. “And then I

came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive

 

Hornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she’d ever

laughed at my glasses.”

“Where exactly did you see the eyes?” said Harry.

“Somewhere there,” said Myrtle, pointing vaguely

toward the sink in front of her toilet.

Harry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was

standing well back, a look of utter terror on his face.

It looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every

inch of it, inside and out, including the pipes below.

And then Harry saw it: Scratched on the side of one of

the copper taps was a tiny snake.

“That tap’s never worked,” said Myrtle brightly as he

tried to turn it.

“Harry,” said Ron. “Say something. Something in

Parseltongue.”

“But — ” Harry thought hard. The only times he’d ever

managed to speak Parseltongue were when he’d been

faced with a real snake. He stared hard at the tiny

engraving, trying to imagine it was real.

“Open up,” he said.

He looked at Ron, who shook his head.

“English,” he said.

Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to

believe it was alive. If he moved his head, the

candlelight made it look as though it were moving.

“Open up,” he said.

 

Except that the words weren’t what he heard; a

strange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap

glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin.

Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact,

sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed,

a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into.

Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had

made up his mind what he was going to do.

“I’m going down there,” he said.

He couldn’t not go, not now they had found the

entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the

faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might

be alive.

“Me too,” said Ron.

There was a pause.

“Well, you hardly seem to need me,” said Lockhart,

with a shadow of his old smile. “I’ll just — ”

He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry

both pointed their wands at him.

“You can go first,” Ron snarled.

White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the

opening.

“Boys,” he said, his voice feeble. “Boys, what good will

it do?”

Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand.

Lockhart slid his legs into the pipe.

 

“I really don’t think — ” he started to say, but Ron

gave him a push, and he slid out of sight. Harry

followed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into the

pipe, then let go.

It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark

slide. He could see more pipes branching off in all

directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted

and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew

that he was falling deeper below the school than even

the dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron,

thudding slightly at the curves.

And then, just as he had begun to worry about what

would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe

leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet

thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone

tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting

to his feet a little ways away, covered in slime and

white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came

whizzing out of the pipe, too.

“We must be miles under the school,” said Harry, his

voice echoing in the black tunnel.

“Under the lake, probably,” said Ron, squinting

around at the dark, slimy walls.

All three of them turned to stare into the darkness

ahead.

“Lumosl” Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again.

“C’mon,” he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they

went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor.

The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a

little distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls

looked monstrous in the wandlight.

 

“Remember,” Harry said quietly as they walked

cautiously forward, “any sign of movement, close your

eyes right away. ...”

But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first

unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as

Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat’s skull.

Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw

that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying

very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if

they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a

dark bend in the tunnel.

“Harry — there’s something up there — ” said Ron

hoarsely, grabbing Harry’s shoulder.

They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline

of something huge and curved, lying right across the

tunnel. It wasn’t moving.

“Maybe it’s asleep,” he breathed, glancing back at the

other two. Lockhart’s hands were pressed over his

eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart

beating so fast it hurt.

Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make

them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand

held high.

The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid,

poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the

tunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have

been twenty feet long at least.

“Blimey,” said Ron weakly.

There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy

Lockhart’s knees had given way.

 

“Get up,” said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at

Lockhart.

Lockhart got to his feet — then he dived at Ron,

knocking him to the ground.

Harry jumped forward, but too late — Lockhart was

straightening up, panting, Ron’s wand in his hand

and a gleaming smile back on his face.

“The adventure ends here, boys!” he said. “I shall take

a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I

was too late to save the girl, and that you two

tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled

body — say good-bye to your memories!”

He raised Ron’s Spellotaped wand high over his head

and yelled, “Obliviatel”

The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb.

Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping

over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great

chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the

floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at

a solid wall of broken rock.

“Ron!” he shouted. “Are you okay? Ron!”

“I’m here!” came Ron’s muffled voice from behind the

rock-fall. “I’m okay — this git’s not, though — he got

blasted by the wand — ”

There was a dull thud and a loud “ow!” It sounded as

though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins.

“What now?” Ron’s voice said, sounding desperate.

“We can’t get through — it’ll take ages. ...”

 

Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks

had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart

anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now

didn’t seem a good moment to try — what if the whole

tunnel caved in?

There was another thud and another “ow!” from

behind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had

already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours. ...

Harry knew there was only one thing to do.

“Wait there,” he called to Ron. “Wait with Lockhart. I’ll

go on. ... If I’m not back in an hour ...”

There was a very pregnant pause.

“I’ll try and shift some of this rock,” said Ron, who

seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. “So you

can — can get back through. And, Harry — ”

“See you in a bit,” said Harry, trying to inject some

confidence into his shaking voice.

And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.

Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the

rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again.

Every nerve in Harry’s body was tingling

unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet

dreaded what he’d find when it did. And then, at last,

as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid

wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were

carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.

Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no

need to pretend these stone snakes were real; their

eyes looked strangely alive.

 

He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his

throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker.

“Open,” said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.

The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the

halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking

from head to foot, walked inside.

 

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

He was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit

chamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more

carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in

darkness, casting long, black shadows through the

odd, greenish gloom that filled the place.

His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to

the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a

shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was

Ginny?

He pulled out his wand and moved forward between

the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed

loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes

narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest

sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone

snakes seemed to be following him. More than once,

with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir.

Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a

statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view,

standing against the back wall.

 

Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant

face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a

long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the

wizard’s sweeping stone robes, where two enormous

gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And

between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed

figure with flaming-red hair.

“Ginnyl” Harry muttered, sprinting to her and

dropping to his knees. “Ginny — don’t be dead —

please don’t be dead — ” He flung his wand aside,

grabbed Ginny’s shoulders, and turned her over. Her

face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes

were closed, so she wasn’t Petrified. But then she

must be —

“Ginny, please wake up,” Harry muttered desperately,

shaking her. Ginny’s head lolled hopelessly from side

to side.

“She won’t wake,” said a soft voice.

Harry jumped and spun around on his knees.

A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the

nearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred

around the edges, as though Harry were looking at

him through a misted window. But there was no

mistaking him —

“Tom — Tom Riddle?”

Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry’s face.

“What d’you mean, she won’t wake?” Harry said

desperately. “She’s not — she’s not — ?”

“She’s still alive,” said Riddle. “But only just.”

 

Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at

Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird,

misty light shining about him, not a day older than

sixteen.

“Are you a ghost?” Harry said uncertainly.

“A memory,” said Riddle quietly. “Preserved in a diary

for fifty years.”

He pointed toward the floor near the statue’s giant

toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry

had found in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. For a

second, Harry wondered how it had got there — but

there were more pressing matters to deal with.

“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” Harry said, raising

Ginny’s head again. “We’ve got to get her out of here.

There’s a basilisk ... I don’t know where it is, but it

could be along any moment. ... Please, help me — ”

Riddle didn’t move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist

Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand

again.

But his wand had gone.

“Did you see — ?”

He looked up. Riddle was still watching him —

twirling Harry’s wand between his long fingers.

“Thanks,” said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.

A smile curled the corners of Riddle’s mouth. He

continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.

 

“Listen,” said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with

Ginny’s dead weight. “We’ve got to go\ If the basilisk

comes — ”

“It won’t come until it is called,” said Riddle calmly.

Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to

hold her up any longer.

“What d’you mean?” he said. “Look, give me my wand,

I might need it — ”

Riddle’s smile broadened.

“You won’t be needing it,” he said.

Harry stared at him.

“What d’you mean, I won’t be — ?”

“I’ve waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,” said

Riddle. “For the chance to see you. To speak to you.”

“Look,” said Harry, losing patience, “I don’t think you

get it. We’re in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk

later — ”

“We’re going to talk now,” said Riddle, still smiling

broadly, and he pocketed Harry’s wand.

Harry stared at him. There was something very funny

going on here. ...

“How did Ginny get like this?” he asked slowly.

“Well, that’s an interesting question,” said Riddle

pleasantly. “And quite a long story. I suppose the real

reason Ginny Weasley’s like this is because she

 

opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an

invisible stranger.”

“What are you talking about?” said Harry.

“The diary,” said Riddle. “My diary. Little Ginny’s been

writing in it for months and months, telling me all her

pitiful worries and woes — how her brothers tease

her, how she had to come to school with secondhand

robes and books, how” — Riddle’s eyes glinted —

“how she didn’t think famous, good, great Harry

Potter would ever like her. ...”

All the time he spoke, Riddle’s eyes never left Harry’s

face. There was an almost hungry look in them.

“It’s very boring, having to listen to the silly little

troubles of an eleven-year-old girl,” he went on. “But I

was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was

kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one’s ever

understood me like you, Tom. ... I’m so glad I’ve got

this diary to confide in. ... It’s like having a friend I can

carry around in my pocket. ...”

Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn’t suit

him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of

Harry’s neck.

“If I say it myself, Harry, I’ve always been able to

charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her

soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what

I wanted. ... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of

her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew

powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley.

Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few

of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back

into her ...”

 

“What d’you mean?” said Harry, whose mouth had

gone very dry.

“Haven’t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?” said Riddle

softly. “Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of

Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and

daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set

the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the

Squib’s cat.”

“No,” Harry whispered.

“Yes,” said Riddle, calmly. “Of course, she didn’t know

what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I

wish you could have seen her new diary entries . . . far

more interesting, they became. ... Dear Tom,” he

recited, watching Harry’s horrified face, “7 think I’m

losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over

my robes and I don’t know how they got there. Dear

Tom, I can’t remember what I did on the night of

Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I’ve got paint

all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me

I’m pale and I’m not myself. I think he suspects me. . . .

There was another attack today and I don’t know

where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I’m

going mad. ... I think I’m the one attacking everyone,

Tom\”

Harry’s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep

into his palms.

“It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop

trusting her diary,” said Riddle. “But she finally

became suspicious and tried to dispose of it. And

that’s where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I

couldn’t have been more delighted. Of all the people

who could have picked it up, it was you, the very

person I was most anxious to meet. ...”

 

“And why did you want to meet me?” said Harry.

Anger was coursing through him, and it was an effort

to keep his voice steady.

“Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,”

said Riddle. “Your whole fascinating history.” His eyes

roved over the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead, and

their expression grew hungrier. “I knew I must find

out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could.

So I decided to show you my famous capture of that

great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust — ”

“Hagrid’s my friend,” said Harry, his voice now

shaking. “And you framed him, didn’t you? I thought

you made a mistake, but — ”

Riddle laughed his high laugh again.

“It was my word against Hagrid’s, Harry. Well, you

can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On

the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant,

parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student

... on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in

trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf

cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden

Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I admit, even / was

surprised how well the plan worked. I thought

someone must realize that Hagrid couldn’t possibly be

the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years

to find out everything I could about the Chamber of

Secrets and discover the secret entrance ... as though

Hagrid had the brains, or the power!

“Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore,

seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded

Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper.

Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed. ...

Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the

other teachers did. ...”

 

“I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,” said

Harry, his teeth gritted.

“Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on

me after Hagrid was expelled,” said Riddle carelessly.

“I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again

while I was still at school. But I wasn’t going to waste

those long years I’d spent searching for it. I decided to

leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old

self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would

be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish

Salazar Slytherin’s noble work.”

“Well, you haven’t finished it,” said Harry

triumphantly. “No one’s died this time, not even the

cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be

ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right

again — ”

“Haven’t I already told you,” said Riddle quietly, “that

killing Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore? For

many months now, my new target has been — you.”

Harry stared at him.

“Imagine how angry I was when the next time my

diary was opened, it was Ginny who was writing to

me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and

panicked. What if you found out how to work it, and I

repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I

told you who’d been strangling roosters? So the

foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was

deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must

do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of

Slytherin’s heir. From everything Ginny had told me

about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to

solve the mystery — particularly if one of your best

friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the

 

whole school was buzzing because you could speak

Parseltongue. ...

“So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall

and come down here to wait. She struggled and cried

and became very boring. But there isn’t much life left

in her. ... She put too much into the diary, into me.

Enough to let me leave its pages at last. ... I have

been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I

knew you’d come. I have many questions for you,

Harry Potter.”

“Like what?” Harry spat, fists still clenched.

“Well,” said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, “how is it that

you — a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical

talent — managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all

time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar,

while Lord Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?”

There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.

“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly.

“Voldemort was after your time. ...”

“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present,

and future, Harry Potter. ...”

He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to

trace it through the air, writing three shimmering

words:

tom marvolo riddle

Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his

name rearranged themselves:

i am lord voldemort

 

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already

using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only,

of course. You think I was going to use my filthy

Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs

the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my

mother’s side? I, keep the name of a foul, common

Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born,

just because he found out his wife was a witch? No,

Harry — I fashioned myself a new name, a name I

knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to

speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the

world!”

Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared

numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had

grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so

many others. ... At last he forced himself to speak.

“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.

“Not what?” snapped Riddle.

“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry,

breathing fast. “Sorry to disappoint you and all that,

but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus

Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were

strong, you didn’t dare try and take over at Hogwarts.

Dumbledore saw through you when you were at

school and he still frightens you now, wherever you’re

hiding these days — ”

The smile had gone from Riddle’s face, to be replaced

by a very ugly look.

“Dumbledore ’s been driven out of this castle by the

mere memory of me!” he hissed.

 

“He’s not as gone as you might think!” Harry retorted.

He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle,

wishing rather than believing it to be true —

Riddle opened his mouth, but froze.

Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled

around to stare down the empty Chamber. The music

was growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling,

unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry’s scalp and made

his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its

normal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch

that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames

erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.

A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared,

piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a

glittering golden tail as long as a peacock’s and

gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged

bundle.

A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It

dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet,

then landed heavily on his shoulder. As it folded its

great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long,

sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.

The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to

Harry’s cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle.

“That’s a phoenix. ...” said Riddle, staring shrewdly

back at it.

“Fawkes?” Harry breathed, and he felt the bird’s

golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently.

“And that — ” said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing

that Fawkes had dropped, “that’s the old school

Sorting Hat — ”

 

So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay

motionless at Harry’s feet.

Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that

the dark Chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles

were laughing at once —

“This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A

songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry

Potter? Do you feel safe now?”

Harry didn’t answer. He might not see what use

Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer

alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with

his courage mounting.

“To business, Harry,” said Riddle, still smiling

broadly. “Twice — in your past, in my future — we

have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you

survive ? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,” he

added softly, “the longer you stay alive.”

Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle

had the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting

Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel.

It looked bad, all right . . . but the longer Riddle stood

there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny ... and

in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle’s

outline was becoming clearer, more solid. ... If it had

to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner

than later.

“No one knows why you lost your powers when you

attacked me,” said Harry abruptly. “I don’t know

myself. But I know why you couldn’t kill me. Because

my mother died to save me. My common Muggle-born

mother,” he added, shaking with suppressed rage.

“She stopped you killing me. And I’ve seen the real

you, I saw you last year. You’re a wreck. You’re barely

 

alive. That’s where all your power got you. You’re in

hiding. You’re ugly, you’re foul — ”

Riddle’s face contorted. Then he forced it into an

awful smile.

“So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that’s a

powerful counter-charm. I can see now ... there is

nothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you

see. There are strange likenesses between us, after

all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods,

orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two

Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great

Slytherin himself. We even look something alike ...

but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved

you from me. That’s all I wanted to know.”

Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his

wand. But Riddle’s twisted smile was widening again.

“Now, Harry, I’m going to teach you a little lesson.

Let’s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of

Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and

the best weapons Dumbledore can give him. ...”

He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting

Hat, then walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his

numb legs, watched Riddle stop between the high

pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin,

high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened

his mouth wide and hissed — but Harry understood

what he was saying. . . .

“ Speak to me, Slytherin , greatest of the Hogwarts

Four.”

Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue,

Fawkes swaying on his shoulder.

 

Slytherin’s gigantic stone face was moving.

Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider

and wider, to make a huge black hole.

And something was stirring inside the statue’s mouth.

Something was slithering up from its depths.

Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber

wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes’

wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted

to shout, “Don’t leave me!” but what chance did a

phoenix have against the king of serpents?

Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber.

Harry felt it shudder — he knew what was happening,

he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent

uncoiling itself from Slytherin’s mouth. Then he heard

Riddle’s hissing voice:

“Kill him.”

The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear

its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty

floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run

blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his

way — Voldemort was laughing —

Harry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted

blood — the serpent was barely feet from him, he

could hear it coming —

There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above

him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard

that he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs

to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing,

something thrashing wildly off the pillars —

He couldn’t help it — he opened his eyes wide enough

to squint at what was going on.

 

The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick

as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and

its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between

the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes

if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.

Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk

was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and

thin as sabers —

Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight

and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the

floor. The snake’s tail thrashed, narrowly missing

Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned

— Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its

eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been

punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the

floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.

“NO!” Harry heard Riddle screaming. “LEAVE THE

BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU!

YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM! KILL HIM!”

The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly.

Fawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song,

jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood

poured from its ruined eyes.

“Help me, help me,” Harry muttered wildly, “someone

— anyone — ”

The snake’s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry

ducked. Something soft hit his face.

The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry’s

arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only

chance — he rammed it onto his head and threw

himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk’s tail swung

over him again.

 

Help me — help me — Harry thought, his eyes

screwed tight under the hat. Please help me —

There was no answering voice. Instead, the hat

contracted, as though an invisible hand was

squeezing it very tightly.

Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top

of Harry’s head, almost knocking him out. Stars

winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the

hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard

beneath it.

A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat,

its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs.

“KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS

BEHIND YOU! SNIFF — SMELL HIM!”

Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk’s head was

falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it

twisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye

sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough

to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his

sword, thin, glittering, venomous —

It lunged blindly — Harry dodged and it hit the

Chamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue

lashed Harry’s side. He raised the sword in both his

hands —

The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was

true — Harry threw his whole weight behind the

sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the

serpent’s mouth —

But as warm blood drenched Harry’s arms, he felt a

searing pain just above his elbow. One long,

poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into

 

his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over

sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.

Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that

was spreading poison through his body and wrenched

it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-

hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the

wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his

own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy.

The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.

A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft

clatter of claws beside him.

“Fawkes,” said Harry thickly. “You were fantastic,

Fawkes. ...” He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on

the spot where the serpent’s fang had pierced him.

He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark

shadow moved in front of him.

“You’re dead, Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s voice above

him. “Dead. Even Dumbledore’s bird knows it. Do you

see what he’s doing, Potter? He’s crying.”

Harry blinked. Fawkes’s head slid in and out of focus.

Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy

feathers.

“I’m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter.

Take your time. I’m in no hurry.”

Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to

be spinning.

“So ends the famous Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s

distant voice. “Alone in the Chamber of Secrets,

forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark

Lord he so unwisely challenged. You’ll be back with

 

your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. ... She

bought you twelve years of borrowed time . . . but Lord

Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must.

If this is dying, thought Harry, it’s not so bad.

Even the pain was leaving him. ...

But was this dying? Instead of going black, the

Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry

gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes,

still resting his head on Harry’s arm. A pearly patch

of tears was shining all around the wound — except

that there was no wound —

“Get away, bird,” said Riddle’s voice suddenly. “Get

away from him — I said, get away — ”

Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry’s

wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and

Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.

“Phoenix tears ...” said Riddle quietly, staring at

Harry’s arm. “Of course ... healing powers ... I forgot

He looked into Harry’s face. “But it makes no

difference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and

me, Harry Potter ... you and me. ...”

He raised the wand —

Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back

overhead and something fell into Harry’s lap — the

diary.

For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still

raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without

 

considering, as though he had meant to do it all

along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next

to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the

book.

There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink

spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over

Harry’s hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing

and twisting, screaming and flailing and then —

He had gone. Harry’s wand fell to the floor with a

clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the

steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The

basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right

through it.

Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head

was spinning as though he’d just traveled miles by

Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand

and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved

the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk’s

mouth.

Then came a faint moan from the end of the

Chamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried

toward her, she sat up. Her bemused eyes traveled

from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry,

in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his

hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears

began to pour down her face.

“Harry — oh, Harry — I tried to tell you at b-

breakfast, but I c -couldn’t say it in front of Percy — it

was me, Harry — but I — I s-swear I d-didn’t mean to

— R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over — and —

how did you kill that — that thing? W-where’s Riddle?

The last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the

diary — ”

 

“It’s all right,” said Harry, holding up the diary, and

showing Ginny the fang hole, “Riddle’s finished. Look!

Him and the basilisk. C’mon, Ginny, let’s get out of

here — ”

“I’m going to be expelled!” Ginny wept as Harry helped

her awkwardly to her feet. “I’ve looked forward to

coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now

I’ll have to leave and — w-what’ll Mum and Dad say?”

Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the

Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they

stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk,

through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.

Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a

soft hiss.

After a few minutes’ progress up the dark tunnel, a

distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry’s

ears.

“Ron!” Harry yelled, speeding up. “Ginny’s okay! I’ve

got her!”

He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned

the next bend to see his eager face staring through

the sizable gap he had managed to make in the

rockfall.

“Ginny\” Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the

rock to pull her through first. “You’re alive! I don’t

believe it! What happened? How — what — where did

that bird come from?”

Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.

“He’s Dumbledore’s,” said Harry, squeezing through

himself.

 

“How come you’ve got a sword?” said Ron, gaping at

the glittering weapon in Harry’s hand.

“I’ll explain when we get out of here,” said Harry with

a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder

than ever.

“But — ”

“Later,” Harry said shortly. He didn’t think it was a

good idea to tell Ron yet who’d been opening the

Chamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway. “Where’s

Lockhart?”

“Back there,” said Ron, still looking puzzled but

jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe. “He’s

in a bad way. Come and see.”

Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a

soft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the

way back to the mouth of the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart

was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.

“His memory’s gone,” said Ron. “The Memory Charm

backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn’t got a clue

who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to

come and wait here. He’s a danger to himself.”

Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.

“Hello,” he said. “Odd sort of place, this, isn’t it? Do

you live here?”

“No,” said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.

Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.

“Have you thought how we’re going to get back up

this?” he said to Ron.

 

Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had

swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of

him, his beady eyes bright in the dark. He was waving

his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly

at him.

“He looks like he wants you to grab hold ...” said Ron,

looking perplexed. “But you’re much too heavy for a

bird to pull up there — ”

“Fawkes,” said Harry, “isn’t an ordinary bird.” He

turned quickly to the others. “We’ve got to hold on to

each other. Ginny, grab Ron’s hand. Professor

Lockhart — ”

“He means you,” said Ron sharply to Lockhart.

“You hold Ginny’s other hand — ”

Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his

belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry’s robes, and

Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes’s

strangely hot tail feathers.

An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through

his whole body and the next second, in a rush of

wings, they were flying upward through the pipe.

Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him,

saying, “Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!”

The chill air was whipping through Harry’s hair, and

before he’d stopped enjoying the ride, it was over —

all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning

Myrtle’s bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his

hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into

place.

Myrtle goggled at them.

“You’re alive,” she said blankly to Harry.

 

“There’s no need to sound so disappointed,” he said

grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his

glasses.

“Oh, well ... I’d just been thinking ... if you had died,

you’d have been welcome to share my toilet,” said

Myrtle, blushing silver.

“Urgh!” said Ron as they left the bathroom for the

dark, deserted corridor outside. “Harry! I think

Myrtle’s grown fond of you! You’ve got competition,

Ginny!”

But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny’s

face.

“Where now?” said Ron, with an anxious look at

Ginny. Harry pointed.

Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the

corridor. They strode after him, and moments later,

found themselves outside Professor McGonagall’s

office.

Harry knocked and pushed the door open.

 

DOBBY’S REWARD

For a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron,

Ginny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in

muck and slime and (in Harry’s case) blood. Then

there was a scream.

“Ginny\”

It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in

front of the fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed

by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on

their daughter.

Harry, however, was looking past them. Professor

Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece,

beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was

taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest.

Fawkes went whooshing past Harry’s ear and settled

on Dumbledore ’s shoulder, just as Harry found

himself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasley’s tight

embrace.

“You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?”

 

“I think we’d all like to know that,” said Professor

McGonagall weakly.

Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a

moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon

it the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted sword, and

what remained of Riddle’s diary.

Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a

quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He

told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how

Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a

basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed

the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them

where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he

had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the

victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of

Secrets might be in her bathroom. ...

“Very well,” Professor McGonagall prompted him as

he paused, “so you found out where the entrance was

— breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along

the way, I might add — but how on earth did you all

get out of there alive, Potter?”

So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this

talking, told them about Fawkes’s timely arrival and

about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then

he faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle’s

diary — or Ginny. She was standing with her head

against Mrs. Weasley ’s shoulder, and tears were still

coursing silently down her cheeks. What if they

expelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle’s diary

didn’t work anymore. ... How could they prove it had

been he who’d made her do it all?

Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who

smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon

spectacles.

 

“What interests me most,” said Dumbledore gently, “is

how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny,

when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in

the forests of Albania.”

Relief — warm, sweeping, glorious relief — swept over

Harry.

“W-what’s that?” said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice.

“You-Know-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny ’s not

... Ginny hasn’t been ... has she?”

“It was this diary,” said Harry quickly, picking it up

and showing it to Dumbledore. “Riddle wrote it when

he was sixteen. ...”

Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered

keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and

soggy pages.

“Brilliant,” he said softly. “Of course, he was probably

the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.”

He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking

utterly bewildered.

“Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once

called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years

ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the

school . . . traveled far and wide . . . sank so deeply into

the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our

kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical

transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord

Voldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone

connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome

boy who was once Head Boy here.”

“But, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What’s our Ginny

got to do with — with — him?”

 

“His d-diary!” Ginny sobbed. “I’ve b-been writing in it,

and he’s been w- writing back all year — ”

“Ginnyl” said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. “Haven’t I

taught you anything ? What have I always told you?

Never trust anything that can think for itself if you

can’t see where it keeps its brain. Why didn’t you

show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious

object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic — ”

“I d-didn’t know,” sobbed Ginny. “I found it inside one

of the books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had

just left it in there and forgotten about it — ”

“Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right

away,” Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. “This

has been a terrible ordeal for her. There will be no

punishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have

been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.” He strode over

to the door and opened it. “Bed rest and perhaps a

large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find

that cheers me up,” he added, twinkling kindly down

at her. “You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still

awake. She’s just giving out Mandrake juice — I

daresay the basilisk’s victims will be waking up any

moment.”

“So Hermione’s okay!” said Ron brightly.

“There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,” said

Dumbledore.

Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley

followed, still looking deeply shaken.

“You know, Minerva,” Professor Dumbledore said

thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, “I think all this

merits a good feast Might I ask you to go and alert

the kitchens?”

 

“Right,” said Professor McGonagall crisply, also

moving to the door. “Ill leave you to deal with Potter

and Weasley, shall I?”

“Certainly,” said Dumbledore.

She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at

Dumbledore. What exactly had Professor McGonagall

meant, deal with them? Surely — surely — they

weren’t about to be punished?

“I seem to remember telling you both that I would

have to expel you if you broke any more school rules,”

said Dumbledore.

Ron opened his mouth in horror.

“Which goes to show that the best of us must

sometimes eat our words,” Dumbledore went on,

smiling. “You will both receive Special Awards for

Services to the School and — let me see — yes, I think

two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.”

Ron went as brightly pink as Lockhart’s valentine

flowers and closed his mouth again.

“But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet

about his part in this dangerous adventure,”

Dumbledore added. “Why so modest, Gilderoy?”

Harry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about

Lockhart. He turned and saw that Lockhart was

standing in a corner of the room, still wearing his

vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him,

Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was

talking to.

 

“Professor Dumbledore,” Ron said quickly, “there was

an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets.

Professor Lockhart — ”

“Am I a professor?” said Lockhart in mild surprise.

“Goodness. I expect I was hopeless, was I?”

“He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand

backfired,” Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore.

“Dear me,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his

long silver mustache quivering. “Impaled upon your

own sword, Gilderoy!”

“Sword?” said Lockhart dimly. “Haven’t got a sword.

That boy has, though.” He pointed at Harry. “He’ll

lend you one.”

“Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the

infirmary, too?” Dumbledore said to Ron. “I’d like a

few more words with Harry. ...”

Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at

Dumbledore and Harry as he closed the door.

Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.

“Sit down, Harry,” he said, and Harry sat, feeling

unaccountably nervous.

“First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,” said

Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again. “You must have

shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing

but that could have called Fawkes to you.”

He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down

onto his knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as

Dumbledore watched him.

 

“And so you met Tom Riddle,” said Dumbledore

thoughtfully. “I imagine he was most interested in

you. ...”

Suddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came

tumbling out of his mouth.

“Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I’m like him.

Strange likenesses, he said. ...”

“ Did he, now?” said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully

at Harry from under his thick silver eyebrows. “And

what do you think, Harry?”

“I don’t think I’m like him!” said Harry, more loudly

than he’d intended. “I mean, I’m — I’m in Gryffindor,

I’m ...”

But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his

mind.

“Professor,” he started again after a moment. “The

Sorting Hat told me I’d — I’d have done well in

Slytherin. Everyone thought / was Slytherin’s heir for

a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue. ...”

“You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said

Dumbledore calmly, “because Lord Voldemort — who

is the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin

— can speak Parseltongue. Unless I’m much

mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to

you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he

intended to do, I’m sure. ...”

“Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” Harry said,

thunderstruck.

“It certainly seems so.”

 

“So I should be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking

desperately into Dumbledore ’s face. “The Sorting Hat

could see Slytherin ’s power in me, and it — ”

“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly.

“Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many

qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked

students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue —

resourcefulness — determination — a certain

disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache

quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in

Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.”

“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a

defeated voice, “because I asked not to go in

Slytherin. ...”

“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, beaming once more.

“Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It

is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far

more than our abilities.” Harry sat motionless in his

chair, stunned. “If you want proof, Harry, that you

belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely

at this.”

Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall’s

desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and

handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry turned it over, the

rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the

name engraved just below the hilt.

Godric Gryffindor.

“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of

the hat, Harry,” said Dumbledore simply.

For a minute, neither of them spoke. Then

Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in

 

Professor McGonagall’s desk and took out a quill and

a bottle of ink.

“What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I

suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to

Azkaban — we need our gamekeeper back. And I

must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet,

too,” he added thoughtfully. “Well be needing a new

Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. ... Dear me,

we do seem to run through them, don’t we?”

Harry got up and crossed to the door. He had just

reached for the handle, however, when the door burst

open so violently that it bounced back off the wall.

Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And

cowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in

bandages, was Dobby.

“Good evening, Lucius,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.

Mr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept

into the room. Dobby went scurrying in after him,

crouching at the hem of his cloak, a look of abject

terror on his face.

The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was

attempting to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoy ’s shoes.

Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a great hurry,

for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his

usually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf

bobbing apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his

cold eyes upon Dumbledore.

“So!” he said “You’ve come back. The governors

suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to

Hogwarts.”

 

“Well, you see, Lucius,” said Dumbledore, smiling

serenely, “the other eleven governors contacted me

today. It was something like being caught in a

hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They’d heard that

Arthur Weasley’s daughter had been killed and

wanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I

was the best man for the job after all. Very strange

tales they told me, too. ... Several of them seemed to

think that you had threatened to curse their families

if they didn’t agree to suspend me in the first place.”

Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes

were still slits of fury.

“So — have you stopped the attacks yet?” he sneered.

“Have you caught the culprit?”

“We have,” said Dumbledore, with a smile.

“Well?” said Mr. Malfoy sharply. “Who is it?”

“The same person as last time, Lucius,” said

Dumbledore. “But this time, Lord Voldemort was

acting through somebody else. By means of this

diary.”

He held up the small black book with the large hole

through the center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely.

Harry, however, was watching Dobby.

The elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes

fixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the

diary, then at Mr. Malfoy, and then hitting himself

hard on the head with his fist.

“I see ...” said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.

“A clever plan,” said Dumbledore in a level voice, still

staring Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. “Because if

 

Harry here” — Mr. Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp

look — “and his friend Ron hadn’t discovered this

book, why — Ginny Weasley might have taken all the

blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she

hadn’t acted of her own free will. ...”

Mr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly

masklike.

“And imagine,” Dumbledore went on, “what might

have happened then. ... The Weasleys are one of our

most prominent pure-blood families. Imagine the

effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection

Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and

killing Muggle-borns. ... Very fortunate the diary was

discovered, and Riddle’s memories wiped from it. Who

knows what the consequences might have been

otherwise. ...”

Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.

“Very fortunate,” he said stiffly.

And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first

to the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching

himself in the head.

And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at

Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting

his ears in punishment.

“Don’t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that

diary, Mr. Malfoy?” said Harry.

Lucius Malfoy rounded on him.

“How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold

of it?” he said.

 

“Because you gave it to her,” said Harry. “In Flourish

and Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration

book and slipped the diary inside it, didn’t you?”

He saw Mr. Malfoy’s white hands clench and

unclench.

“Prove it,” he hissed.

“Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said Dumbledore,

smiling at Harry. “Not now that Riddle has vanished

from the book. On the other hand, I would advise you,

Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord

Voldemort’s old school things. If any more of them

find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur

Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back

to you. ...”

Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry

distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was

longing to reach for his wand. Instead, he turned to

his house-elf.

“We’re going, Dobby!”

He wrenched open the door and as the elf came

hurrying up to him, he kicked him right through it.

They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the

way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment,

thinking hard. Then it came to him —

“Professor Dumbledore,” he said hurriedly. “Can I give

that diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?”

“Certainly, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly. “But

hurry. The feast, remember. ...”

Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office.

He could hear Dobby’s squeals of pain receding

 

around the corner. Quickly, wondering if this plan

could possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes,

pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary

into it. Then he ran down the dark corridor.

He caught up with them at the top of the stairs.

“Mr. Malfoy,” he gasped, skidding to a halt, “I’ve got

something for you — ”

And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy’s

hand.

“What the — ?”

Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it

aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to

Harry.

“You’ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one

of these days, Harry Potter,” he said softly. “They were

meddlesome fools, too.”

He turned to go.

“Come, Dobby. I said, come.”

But Dobby didn’t move. He was holding up Harry’s

disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it

were a priceless treasure.

“Master has given a sock,” said the elf in wonderment.

“Master gave it to Dobby.”

“What’s that?” spat Mr. Malfoy. “What did you say?”

“Got a sock,” said Dobby in disbelief. “Master threw it,

and Dobby caught it, and Dobby — Dobby is free.”

 

Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he

lunged at Harry.

“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!”

But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry

Potter!”

There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown

backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a

time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing

below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his

wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.

“You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at

Mr. Malfoy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You

shall go now.”

Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed

stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around

him and hurried out of sight.

“Harry Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing

up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window

reflected in his orb-like eyes. “Harry Potter set Dobby

free!”

“Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning. “Just

promise never to try and save my life again.”

The elf’s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide,

toothy smile.

“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said Harry as

Dobby pulled on Harry’s sock with shaking hands.

“You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-

Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well — ”

 

“It was a clue, sir,” said Dobby, his eyes widening, as

though this was obvious. “Was giving you a clue. The

Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be

freely named, you see?”

“Right,” said Harry weakly. “Well, I’d better go. There’s

a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by

now. ...”

Dobby threw his arms around Harry’s middle and

hugged him.

“Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!” he

sobbed. “Farewell, Harry Potter!”

And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.

Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never

one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas,

and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn’t know

whether the best bit was Hermione running toward

him, screaming “You solved it! You solved it!” or

Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to

wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting

him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing

Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they

were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and

Ron’s four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the

House Cup for the second year running, or Professor

McGonagall standing up to tell them all that the

exams had been canceled as a school treat (“Oh, no!”

said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that,

unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to

return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to

go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the

teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.

“Shame,” said Ron, helping himself to a jam

doughnut. “He was starting to grow on me.”

 

The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing

sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a

few, small differences — Defense Against the Dark

Arts classes were canceled (“but we’ve had plenty of

practice at that anyway,” Ron told a disgruntled

Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a

school governor. Draco was no longer strutting

around the school as though he owned the place. On

the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the

other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy

again.

Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the

Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred,

George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves.

They made the most of the last few hours in which

they were allowed to do magic before the holidays.

They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of

Fred and George’s Filibuster fireworks, and practiced

disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting

very good at it.

They were almost at King’s Cross when Harry

remembered something.

“Ginny — what did you see Percy doing, that he didn’t

want you to tell anyone?”

“Oh, that,” said Ginny, giggling. “Well — Percy’s got a

girlfriend.”

Fred dropped a stack of books on George’s head.

“What?”

“It’s that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,”

said Ginny. “That’s who he was writing to all last

summer. He’s been meeting her all over the school in

secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty

 

classroom one day. He was so upset when she was —

you know — attacked. You won’t tease him, will you?”

she added anxiously.

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” said Fred, who was looking

like his birthday had come early.

“Definitely not,” said George, sniggering.

The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.

Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and

turned to Ron and Hermione.

“This is called a telephone number,” he told Ron,

scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and

handing it to them. “I told your dad how to use a

telephone last summer — he’ll know. Call me at the

Dursleys’, okay? I can’t stand another two months

with only Dudley to talk to. ...”

“Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won’t

they?” said Hermione as they got off the train and

joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted

barrier. “When they hear what you did this year?

“Proud?” said Harry. “Are you crazy? All those times I

could’ve died, and I didn’t manage it? They’ll be

furious. ...”

And together they walked back through the gateway

to the Muggle world.

OWL POST

Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways.

For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more

than any other time of year. For another, he really

wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in

secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to

be a wizard.

It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his

stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his

head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large

leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda

Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry

moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page,

frowning as he looked for something that would help

him write his essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth

Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.”

The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking

paragraph. Harry pushed his round glasses up the

bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the

book, and read:

 

Non-magic people (more commonly known as

Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval

times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare

occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard,

burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard

would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and

then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a

gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird

enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed

herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in

various disguises.

Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached

underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of

parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed

the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to

write, pausing every now and then to listen, because

if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill

on their way to the bathroom, he’d probably find

himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for

the rest of the summer.

The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was

the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer

holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son,

Dudley, were Harry’s only living relatives. They were

Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude

toward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had been a

witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned

under the Dursleys’ roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and

Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as

downtrodden as possible, they would be able to

squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had

been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of

anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the

last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and

Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to

lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and

 

broomstick at the start of the summer break, and

forbid him to talk to the neighbors.

This separation from his spellbooks had been a real

problem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts

had given him a lot of holiday work. One of the

essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking

potions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher,

Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an

excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had

therefore seized his chance in the first week of the

holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and

Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire

Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices,

so that the rest of the street would notice it too),

Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the

cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his

books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as

he didn’t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the

Dursleys need never know that he was studying

magic by night.

Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his

aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already

in an especially bad mood with him, all because he’d

received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one

week into the school vacation.

Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry’s best friends at

Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. This

meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn’t, but

had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily it

had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.

“Vernon Dursley speaking.”

Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time,

froze as he heard Ron’s voice answer.

 

“HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I — WANT —

TO — TALK — TO — HARRY — POTTER!”

Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped

and held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring

at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm.

“WHO IS THIS?” he roared in the direction of the

mouthpiece. “WHO ARE YOU?”

“RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he

and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends

of a football field. “I’M — A — FRIEND — OF —

HARRY’S — FROM — SCHOOL — ”

Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry,

who was rooted to the spot.

“THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared,

now holding the receiver at arm’s length, as though

frightened it might explode. “I DONT KNOW WHAT

SCHOOL YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER

CONTACT ME AGAIN! DONT YOU COME NEAR MY

FAMILY!”

And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as

if dropping a poisonous spider.

The fight that had followed had been one of the worst

ever.

“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE

LIKE — PEOPLE LIKE YOU!” Uncle Vernon had

roared, spraying Harry with spit.

Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into

trouble, because he hadn’t called again. Harry’s other

best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn’t

been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had

 

warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity,

because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry’s

year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to

use a telephone, and would probably have had

enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.

So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding

friends for five long weeks, and this summer was

turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There

was just one very small improvement — after

swearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to

any of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his

owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in

because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked

in her cage all the time.

Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and

paused to listen again. The silence in the dark house

was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his

enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late, Harry

thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness.

Perhaps he’d finish this essay tomorrow night. ...

He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old

pillowcase from under his bed; put the flashlight, A

History of Magic, his essay, quill, and ink inside it; got

out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard

under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and

checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his

bedside table.

It was one o’clock in the morning. Harry’s stomach

gave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years old,

without realizing it, for a whole hour.

Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little

he looked forward to his birthdays. He had never

received a birthday card in his life. The Dursleys had

 

completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had

no reason to suppose they would remember this one.

Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig’s

large, empty cage, to the open window. He leaned on

the sill, the cool night air pleasant on his face after a

long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been

absent for two nights now. Harry wasn’t worried

about her: she’d been gone this long before. But he

hoped she’d be back soon — she was the only living

creature in this house who didn’t flinch at the sight of

him.

Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his

age, had grown a few inches over the last year. His

jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had

been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The

eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his

forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin

scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.

Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was

the most extraordinary of all. It was not, as the

Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of

the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, because

Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash.

They had been murdered, murdered by the most

feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord

Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack

with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where

Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had

rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive,

Voldemort had fled. ...

But Harry had come face-to-face with him at

Hogwarts. Remembering their last meeting as he

stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was

lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.

 

He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig,

perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse

dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing

absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before

Harry realized what he was seeing.

Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing

larger every moment, was a large, strangely lopsided

creature, and it was flapping in Harry’s direction. He

stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For

a split second he hesitated, his hand on the window

latch, wondering whether to slam it shut. But then

the bizarre creature soared over one of the street

lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it

was, leapt aside.

Through the window soared three owls, two of them

holding up the third, which appeared to be

unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on

Harry’s bed, and the middle owl, which was large and

gray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was

a large package tied to its legs.

Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his

name was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley

family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords

around Errol’s legs, took off the parcel, and then

carried Errol to Hedwig’s cage. Errol opened one

bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to

gulp some water.

Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of

them, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig.

She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely

pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate

nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then

flew across the room to join Errol.

 

Harry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome

tawny one, but he knew at once where it had come

from, because in addition to a third package, it was

carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When

Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its

feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off

through the window into the night.

Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol’s

package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a

present wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday

card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the

envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a

newspaper clipping.

The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding

newspaper, the Daily Prophet, because the people in

the black-and-white picture were moving. Harry

picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:

MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE

SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE

Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts

Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual

Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.

A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, “We

will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in

Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse

breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank. ”

The Weasley family will be spending a month in

Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year

at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children

currently attend.

 

Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin

spread across his face as he saw all nine of the

Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of

a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall,

balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all

(though the black-and-white picture didn’t show it)

with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of the

picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat,

Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his

little sister, Ginny.

Harry couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a

large pile of gold more than the Weasleys, who were

very nice and extremely poor. He picked up Ron’s

letter and unfolded it.

Dear Harry,

Happy birthday!

Look, I’m really sorry about that telephone call. I hope

the Muggles didn’t give you a hard time. I asked Dad,

and he reckons I shouldn’t have shouted.

It’s amazing here in Egypt. Bill’s taken us around all

the tombs and you wouldn’t believe the curses those

old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum wouldn’t let

Ginny come in the last one. There were all these

mutant skeletons in there, of Muggles who’d broken in

and grown extra heads and stuff.

I couldn’t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet

Draw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it’s gone on

this trip, but they’re going to buy me a new wand for

next year.

Harry remembered only too well the occasion when

Ron’s old wand had snapped. It had happened when

 

the car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts

had crashed into a tree on the school grounds.

We’ll be back about a week before term starts and

we’ll be going up to London to get my wand and our

new books. Any chance of meeting you there?

Don’t let the Muggles get you down!

Try and come to London,

Ron

PS. Percy’s Head Boy. He got the letter last week.

Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who

was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, was

looking particularly smug. He had pinned his Head

Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his

neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the

Egyptian sun.

Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it.

Inside was what looked like a miniature glass

spinning top. There was another note from Ron

beneath it.

Harry — this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there’s

someone untrustworthy around, it’s supposed to light

up and spin. Bill says it’s rubbish sold for wizard

tourists and isn’t reliable, because it kept lighting up at

dinner last night. But he didn’t realize Fred and George

had put beetles in his soup.

Bye —

Ron

 

Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside

table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point,

reflecting the luminous hands of his clock. He looked

at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the

parcel Hedwig had brought.

Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card,

and a letter, this time from Hermione.

Dear Harry,

Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to

your Uncle Vernon. I do hope you’re all right.

I’m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn’t

know how I was going to send this to you — what if

they’d opened it at customs? — but then Hedwig

turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got

something for your birthday for a change. I bought your

present by owl-order; there was an advertisement in

the Daily Prophet (I’ve been getting it delivered; it’s so

good to keep up with what’s going on in the wizarding

world). Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a

week ago? I bet he’s learning loads. I’m really jealous

— the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating.

There’s some interesting local history of witchcraft

here, too. I’ve rewritten my whole History of Magic

essay to include some of the things I’ve found out. I

hope it’s not too long — it’s two rolls of parchment more

than Professor Binns asked for.

Ron says he’s going to be in London in the last week of

the holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and

uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If not, I’ll see

you on the Hogwarts Express on September first!

Love from

 

Hermione

PS. Ron says Percy’s Head Boy. I’ll bet Percy’s really

pleased.

Ron doesn’t seem too happy about it.

Harry laughed as he put Hermione ’s letter aside and

picked up her present. It was very heavy. Knowing

Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book full of

very difficult spells — but it wasn’t. His heart gave a

huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a

sleek black leather case, with silver words stamped

across it, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit.

“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the

case to look inside.

There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish

Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig

Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom

for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself

Broomcare.

Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed

most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most

popular sport in the magical world — highly

dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks.

Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player;

he had been the youngest person in a century to be

picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of

Harry’s most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two

Thousand racing broom.

Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his

last parcel. He recognized the untidy scrawl on the

brown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the

Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of

paper and glimpsed something green and leathery,

 

but before he could unwrap it properly, the parcel

gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it

snapped loudly — as though it had jaws.

Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send

him anything dangerous on purpose, but then,

Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of what

was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend

giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from

men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his

cabin.

Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly

again. Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside

table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over

his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of

the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.

And out fell — a book. Harry just had time to register

its handsome green cover, emblazoned with the

golden title The Monster Book of Monsters, before it

flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the

bed like some weird crab.

“Uh-oh,” Harry muttered.

The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and

shuffled rapidly across the room. Harry followed it

stealthily. The book was hiding in the dark space

under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still

fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees

and reached toward it.

“Ouch!”

The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped

past him, still scuttling on its covers. Harry

scrambled around, threw himself forward, and

 

managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud,

sleepy grunt in the room next door.

Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry

clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms,

hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt,

which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book

shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap,

so Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for

Hagrid’s card.

Dear Harry,

Happy birthday!

Think you might find this useful for next year.

Won’t say no more here. Tell you when I see you.

Hope the Muggles are treating you right.

All the best,

Hagrid

It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a

biting book would come in useful, but he put Hagrid’s

card up next to Ron’s and Hermione’s, grinning more

broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from

Hogwarts left.

Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry

slit open the envelope, pulled out the first page of

parchment within, and read:

Dear Mr. Potter,

Please note that the new school year will begin on

September the first. The Hogwarts Express will leave

 

from King’s Cross station, platform nine and three-

quarters, at eleven o’clock.

Third years are permitted to visit the village of

Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the

enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to

sign.

A list of books for next year is enclosed.

Yours sincerely,

Professor M. McGonagall

Deputy Headmistress

Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and

looked at it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful

to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an

entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot

there. But how on earth was he going to persuade

Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form?

He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two

o’clock in the morning.

Deciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form

when he woke up, Harry got back into bed and

reached up to cross off another day on the chart he’d

made for himself, counting down the days left until

his return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses

and lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday

cards.

Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment

Harry Potter felt just like everyone else — glad, for the

first time in his life, that it was his birthday.

 

AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE

Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to

find the three Dursleys already sitting around the

kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new

television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present

for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about

the long walk between the fridge and the television in

the living room. Dudley had spent most of the

summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on

the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate

continually.

Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a

large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of

mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday,

none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had

noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too

used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of

toast and then looked up at the reporter on the

television, who was halfway through a report on an

escaped convict:

 

"... The public is warned that Black is armed and

extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set

up, and any sighting of Black should be reported

immediately.”

“No need to tell us he’s no good,” snorted Uncle

Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the

prisoner. “Look at the state of him, the filthy

layabout! Look at his hair!”

He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy

hair had always been a source of great annoyance to

Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the

television, however, whose gaunt face was

surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry

felt very well groomed indeed.

The reporter had reappeared.

“The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will

announce today — ”

“Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at

the reporter. “You didn’t tell us where that maniac’s

escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be

coming up the street right now!”

Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced,

whipped around and peered intently out of the

kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would

simply love to be the one to call the hot line number.

She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent

most of her life spying on the boring, law-abiding

neighbors.

“When will they learn,” said Uncle Vernon, pounding

the table with his large purple fist, “that hanging’s the

only way to deal with these people?”

 

“Very true,” said Aunt Petunia, who was still

squinting into next door’s runner beans.

Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his

watch, and added, “I’d better be off in a minute,

Petunia. Marge’s train gets in at ten.”

Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the

Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth

with an unpleasant bump.

“Aunt Marge?” he blurted out. “Sh — she’s not

coming here, is she?”

Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon’s sister. Even though

she was not a blood relative of Harry’s (whose mother

had been Aunt Petunia’s sister), he had been forced to

call her “Aunt” all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the

country, in a house with a large garden, where she

bred bulldogs. She didn’t often stay at Privet Drive,

because she couldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs,

but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in

Harry’s mind.

At Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had

whacked Harry around the shins with her walking

stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical

statues. A few years later, she had turned up at

Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and

a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the

year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had

accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog.

Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up

a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off

until past midnight. The memory of this incident still

brought tears of laughter to Dudley’s eyes.

“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled,

“and while we’re on the subject” — he pointed a fat

 

finger threateningly at Harry — “we need to get a few

things straight before I go and collect her.”

Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the

television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle

Vernon was Dudley’s favorite form of entertainment.

“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil

tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.”

“All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s

talking to me.”

“Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he

had not heard Harry’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know

anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any —

any funny stuff while she’s here. You behave yourself,

got me?”

“I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth.

“And thirdly,” said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes

now slits in his great purple face, “we’ve told Marge

you attend St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably

Criminal Boys.”

“What?” Harry yelled.

“And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be

trouble,” spat Uncle Vernon.

Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at

Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge

coming for a week-long visit — it was the worst

birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him,

including that pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks.

 

“Well, Petunia,” said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to

his feet, “111 be off to the station, then. Want to come

along for the ride, Dudders?”

“No,” said Dudley, whose attention had returned to

the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished

threatening Harry.

“Duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie,”

said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley’s thick blond

hair. “Mummy’s bought him a lovely new bow tie.”

Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder.

“See you in a bit, then,” he said, and he left the

kitchen.

Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified

trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he

got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to

the front door.

Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.

“I’m not taking you,” he snarled as he turned to see

Harry watching him.

“Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly. “I want to

ask you something.”

Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.

“Third years at Hog — at my school are allowed to

visit the village sometimes,” said Harry.

“So?” snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from

a hook next to the door.

 

“I need you to sign the permission form,” said Harry

in a rush.

“And why should I do that?” sneered Uncle Vernon.

“Well,” said Harry, choosing his words carefully, “it’ll

be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that

St. Whatsits — ”

“St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal

Boys!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased

to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon’s

voice.

“Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle

Vernon’s large, purple face. “It’s a lot to remember. I’ll

have to make it sound convincing, won’t I? What if I

accidentally let something slip?”

“ You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you?”

roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist

raised. But Harry stood his ground.

“Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt

Marge forget what I could tell her,” he said grimly.

Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an

ugly puce.

“But if you sign my permission form,” Harry went on

quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to

go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal

and everything.”

Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it

over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was

throbbing in his temple.

 

“Right,” he snapped finally. “I shall monitor your

behavior carefully during Marge’s visit. If, at the end

of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, I’ll

sign your ruddy form.”

He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and

slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of

glass at the top fell out.

Harry didn’t return to the kitchen. He went back

upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a

real Muggle, he’d better start now. Slowly and sadly

he gathered up all his presents and his birthday

cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with

his homework. Then he went to Hedwig’s cage. Errol

seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both

asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then

poked them both awake.

“Hedwig,” he said gloomily, “you’re going to have to

clear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron’ll look after

you. I’ll write him a note, explaining. And don’t look at

me like that” — Hedwig’s large amber eyes were

reproachful — “it’s not my fault. It’s the only way I’ll

be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and

Hermione.”

Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note

to Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window

and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly

miserable, put the empty cage away inside the

wardrobe.

But Harry didn’t have long to brood. In next to no

time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for

Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their

guest.

 

“Do something about your hair!” Aunt Petunia

snapped as he reached the hall.

Harry couldn’t see the point of trying to make his hair

lie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the

untidier he looked, the happier she would be.

All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as

Uncle Vernon’s car pulled back into the driveway,

then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the

garden path.

“Get the door!” Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.

A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled

the door open.

On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like

Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple-faced, she

even had a mustache, though not as bushy as his. In

one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked

under the other was an old and evil-tempered

bulldog.

“Where’s my Dudders?” roared Aunt Marge. “Where’s

my neffy-poo?”

Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair

plastered flat to his fat head, a bow tie just visible

under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the

suitcase into Harry’s stomach, knocking the wind out

of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and

planted a large kiss on his cheek.

Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up

with Aunt Marge’s hugs because he was well paid for

it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley

had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.

 

“Petunia!” shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as

though he was a hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt

Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her

large jaw against Aunt Petunia’s bony cheekbone.

Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut

the door.

“Tea, Marge?” he said. “And what will Ripper take?”

“Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,” said

Aunt Marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen,

leaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase. But

Harry wasn’t complaining; any excuse not to be with

Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the

case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long

as he could.

By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge

had been supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper

was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt

Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool

flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.

“Who’s looking after the other dogs, Marge?” Uncle

Vernon asked.

“Oh, I’ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,”

boomed Aunt Marge. “He’s retired now, good for him

to have something to do. But I couldn’t leave poor old

Ripper. He pines if he’s away from me.”

Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This

directed Aunt Marge’s attention to Harry for the first

time.

“So!” she barked. “Still here, are you?”

“Yes,” said Harry.

 

“Don’t you say ‘yes’ in that ungrateful tone,” Aunt

Marge growled. “It’s damn good of Vernon and

Petunia to keep you. Wouldn’t have done it myself.

You’d have gone straight to an orphanage if you’d

been dumped on my doorstep.”

Harry was bursting to say that he’d rather live in an

orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of

the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He forced his face

into a painful smile.

“Don’t you smirk at me!” boomed Aunt Marge. “I can

see you haven’t improved since I last saw you. I hoped

school would knock some manners into you.” She

took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and

said, “Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?”

“St. Brutus’s,” said Uncle Vernon promptly. “It’s a

first-rate institution for hopeless cases.”

“I see,” said Aunt Marge. “Do they use the cane at St.

Brutus’s, boy?” she barked across the table.

“Er — ”

Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge’s

back.

“Yes,” said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do

the thing properly, he added, “all the time.”

“Excellent,” said Aunt Marge. “I won’t have this

namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not

hitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing is

what’s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred.

Have you been beaten often?”

“Oh, yeah,” said Harry, “loads of times.”

 

Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes.

“I still don’t like your tone, boy,” she said. “If you can

speak of your beatings in that casual way, they

clearly aren’t hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I’d

write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the

use of extreme force in this boy’s case.”

Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might

forget their bargain; in any case, he changed the

subject abruptly.

“Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about

that escaped prisoner, eh?”

As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry

caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at

number four without her. Uncle Vernon and Aunt

Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their

way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt

Marge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her

eye at all times, so that she could boom out

suggestions for his improvement. She delighted in

comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge

pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while

glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he

hadn’t got a present too. She also kept throwing out

dark hints about what made Harry such an

unsatisfactory person.

“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s

turned out, Vernon,” she said over lunch on the third

day. “If there’s something rotten on the inside, there’s

nothing anyone can do about it.”

Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands

shook and his face was starting to burn with anger.

Remember the form, he told himself. Think about

Hogsmeade. Don’t say anything. Don’t rise —

 

Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.

“It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said. “You

see it all the time with dogs. If there’s something

wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong

with the pup — ”

At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was

holding exploded in her hand. Shards of glass flew in

every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and

blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.

“Marge!” squealed Aunt Petunia. “Marge, are you all

right?”

“Not to worry,” grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face

with her napkin. “Must have squeezed it too hard. Did

the same thing at Colonel Fubster’s the other day. No

need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip ...”

But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both

looking at Harry suspiciously, so he decided he’d

better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon

as he could.

Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall,

breathing deeply. It had been a long time since he’d

lost control and made something explode. He couldn’t

afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form

wasn’t the only thing at stake — if he carried on like

that, he’d be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic.

Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was

forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school.

His record wasn’t exactly clean either. Only last

summer he’d gotten an official warning that had

stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of

any more magic in Privet Drive, Harry would face

expulsion from Hogwarts.

 

He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried

upstairs out of the way.

Harry got through the next three days by forcing

himself to think about his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself

Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him. This

worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a

glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the

opinion that he was mentally subnormal.

At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge’s stay

arrived. Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and

Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles of wine. They

got all the way through the soup and the salmon

without a single mention of Harry’s faults; during the

lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them all

with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making

company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle

Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy.

“Can I tempt you, Marge?”

Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her

huge face was very red.

“Just a small one, then,” she chuckled. “A bit more

than that ... and a bit more ... that’s the ticket.”

Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt

Petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger

sticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear into his

bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon’s angry little eyes

and knew he would have to sit it out.

“Aah,” said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and

putting the empty brandy glass back down. “Excellent

nosh, Petunia. It’s normally just a fry-up for me of an

evening, with twelve dogs to look after. ...” She

burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach.

 

“Pardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-sized boy,”

she went on, winking at Dudley. “You’ll be a proper-

sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I’ll have a

spot more brandy, Vernon. ...”

“Now, this one here — ”

She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach

clench. The Handbook, he thought quickly.

“This one’s got a mean, runty look about him. You get

that with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last

year. Ratty little thing it was. Weak. Underbred.”

Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his

book: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers.

“It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other

day. Bad blood will out. Now, I’m saying nothing

against your family, Petunia” — she patted Aunt

Petunia’s bony hand with her shovellike one — “but

your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best

families. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here’s

the result right in front of us.”

Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his

ears. Grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he thought.

But he couldn’t remember what came next. Aunt

Marge’s voice seemed to be boring into him like one of

Uncle Vernon’s drills.

“This Potter,” said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the

brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and

over the tablecloth, “you never told me what he did?”

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking

extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his

pie to gape at his parents.

 

“He — didn’t work,” said Uncle Vernon, with half a

glance at Harry. “Unemployed.”

“As I expected!” said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig

of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. “A no-

account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who — ”

“He was not,” said Harry suddenly. The table went

very quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He had never

felt so angry in his life.

“MORE BRANDY!” yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone

very white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge’s

glass. “You, boy,” he snarled at Harry. “Go to bed, go

on — ”

“No, Vernon,” hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a

hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry’s. “Go

on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They

go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I

expect) — ”

“They didn’t die in a car crash!” said Harry, who

found himself on his feet.

“They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left

you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking

relatives!” screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury.

“You are an insolent, ungrateful little — ”

But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a

moment, it looked as though words had failed her.

She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger —

but the swelling didn’t stop. Her great red face started

to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth

stretched too tightly for speech — next second,

several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket

and pinged off the walls — she was inflating like a

monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her

 

tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a

salami —

“MARGE!” yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia

together as Aunt Marge’s whole body began to rise off

her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round,

now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her

hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up

into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper

came skidding into the room, barking madly.

“NOOOOOOO!”

Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge’s feet and tried to

pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the

floor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and

sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon’s leg.

Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could

stop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs.

The cupboard door burst magically open as he

reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the

front door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself

under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard,

and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and

birthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig’s

empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his

trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining

room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.

“COME BACK IN HERE!” he bellowed. “COME BACK

AND PUT HER RIGHT!”

But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked

his trunk open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at

Uncle Vernon.

“She deserved it,” Harry said, breathing very fast.

“She deserved what she got. You keep away from me.”

 

He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.

“I’m going,” Harry said. “I’ve had enough.”

And in the next moment, he was out in the dark,

quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him,

Hedwig’s cage under his arm.

 

3

THE KNIGHT BUS

Harry was several streets away before he collapsed

onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from

the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still,

anger still surging through him, listening to the

frantic thumping of his heart.

But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new

emotion overtook him: panic. Whichever way he

looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. He was

stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with

absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he

had just done serious magic, which meant that he

was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had

broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage

Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic

representatives weren’t swooping down on him where

he sat.

Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia

Crescent. What was going to happen to him? Would

he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from

the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and

 

Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was

sure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would

want to help him now, but they were both abroad,

and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting

them.

He didn’t have any Muggle money, either. There was a

little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of

his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had

left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding

Bank in London. He’d never be able to drag his trunk

all the way to London. Unless ...

He looked down at his wand, which he was still

clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his

heart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit more

magic couldn’t hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he

had inherited from his father — what if he bewitched

the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his

broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to

London? Then he could get the rest of his money out

of his vault and ... begin his life as an outcast. It was

a horrible prospect, but he couldn’t sit on this wall

forever, or he’d find himself trying to explain to

Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night

with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.

Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the

contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak —

but before he had found it, he straightened up

suddenly, looking around him once more.

A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made

Harry feel he was being watched, but the street

appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from

any of the large square houses.

He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately

stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand.

 

He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or

something was standing in the narrow gap between

the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted

at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he’d

know whether it was just a stray cat or — something

else.

“Lumos,” Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the

end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high

over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number

two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and

between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking

outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming

eyes.

Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and

he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung

out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in

the gutter —

There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his

hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding

light —

With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in

time. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and

headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry

had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw

when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently

purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold

lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus.

For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been

knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple

uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak

loudly to the night.

“Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for

the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your

 

wand hand, step on board, and we can take you

anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike,

and I will be your conductor this eve — ”

The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught

sight of Harry, who was still sitting on the ground.

Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to

his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was

only a few years older than he was, eighteen or

nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and

quite a few pimples.

“What were you doin’ down there?” said Stan,

dropping his professional manner.

“Fell over,” said Harry.

“ ’Choo fall over for?” sniggered Stan.

“I didn’t do it on purpose,” said Harry, annoyed. One

of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he

had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding. He

suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and

turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway

between the garage and fence. The Knight Bus’s

headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was

empty.

“ ’Choo lookin’ at?” said Stan.

“There was a big black thing,” said Harry, pointing

uncertainly into the gap. “Like a dog ... but massive

He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly

open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan’s eyes

move to the scar on Harry’s forehead.

“Woss that on your ’ead?” said Stan abruptly.

 

“Nothing,” said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over

his scar. If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him,

he didn’t want to make it too easy for them.

“Woss your name?” Stan persisted.

“Neville Longbottom,” said Harry, saying the first

name that came into his head. “So — so this bus,” he

went on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, “did you say

it goes anywhere?”

“Yep,” said Stan proudly, “anywhere you like, long’s

it’s on land. Can’t do nuffink underwater. ’Ere,” he

said, looking suspicious again, “you did flag us down,

dincha? Stuck out your wand ’and, dincha?”

“Yes,” said Harry quickly. “Listen, how much would it

be to get to London?”

“Eleven Sickles,” said Stan, “but for firteen you get ’ot

chocolate, and for fifteen you get an ’ot water bottle

an’ a toofbrush in the color of your choice.”

Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted

his money bag, and shoved some gold into Stan’s

hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with

Hedwig’s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the

bus.

There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass

bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows.

Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed,

illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in

a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, “Not now,

thanks, I’m pickling some slugs” and rolled over in his

sleep.

“You ’ave this one,” Stan whispered, shoving Harry’s

trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was

 

sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel.

“This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This is Neville

Longbottom, Ern.”

Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick

glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his

bangs again and sat down on his bed.

“Take ’er away, Ern,” said Stan, sitting down in the

armchair next to Ernie’s.

There was another tremendous BANG, and the next

moment Harry found himself flat on his bed, thrown

backward by the speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling

himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and

saw that they were now bowling along a completely

different street. Stan was watching Harry’s stunned

face with great enjoyment.

“This is where we was before you flagged us down,” he

said. “Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?”

“Ar,” said Ernie.

“How come the Muggles don’t hear the bus?” said

Harry.

“Them!” said Stan contemptuously. “Don’ listen

properly, do they? Don’ look properly either. Never

notice nuffink, they don’.”

“Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,” said Ern.

“Well be in Abergavenny in a minute.”

Stan passed Harry’s bed and disappeared up a

narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out

of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie

didn’t seem to have mastered the use of a steering

wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement,

 

but it didn’t hit anything; lines of lampposts,

mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it

approached and back into position once it had

passed.

Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly

green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak.

“ ’Ere you go, Madam Marsh,” said Stan happily as

Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or

so toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh

clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered

down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and

rammed the doors shut; there was another loud

BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow

country lane, trees leaping out of the way.

Harry wouldn’t have been able to sleep even if he had

been traveling on a bus that didn’t keep banging

loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His

stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what

was going to happen to him, and whether the

Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the

ceiling yet.

Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and

was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A

large photograph of a sunken-faced man with long,

matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front

page. He looked strangely familiar.

“That man!” Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a

moment. “He was on the Muggle news!”

Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.

“Sirius Black,” he said, nodding. “ ’Course ’e was on

the Muggle news, Neville, where you been?”

 

He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look

on Harry’s face, removed the front page, and handed

it to Harry.

“You oughta read the papers more, Neville.”

Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:

BLACK STILL AT LARGE

Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner

ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding

capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.

“We are doing all we can to recapture Black,” said the

Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning,

“and we beg the magical community to remain calm.”

Fudge has been criticized by some members of the

International Federation of Warlocks for informing the

Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis.

“Well, really, I had to, don’t you know,” said an

irritable Fudge. “Black is mad. He’s a danger to

anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the

Prime Minister’s assurance that he will not breathe a

word of Black’s true identity to anyone. And let’s face

it — who’d believe him if he did?”

While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a

gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill

each other), the magical community lives in fear of a

massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black

murdered thirteen people with a single curse.

Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black,

the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive.

 

Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen

pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts

classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked

just like one.

“Scary-lookin’ fing, inee?” said Stan, who had been

watching Harry read.

“He murdered thirteen people?” said Harry, handing

the page back to Stan, “with one curse?”

“Yep,” said Stan, “in front of witnesses an’ all. Broad

daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?”

“Ar,” said Ern darkly.

Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back,

the better to look at Harry.

“Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-’Oo,” he said.

“What, Voldemort?” said Harry, without thinking.

Even Stan’s pimples went white; Ern jerked the

steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to

jump aside to avoid the bus.

“You outta your tree?” yelped Stan. “ ’Choo say ’is

name for?”

“Sorry,” said Harry hastily. “Sorry, I — I forgot — ”

“Forgot!” said Stan weakly. “Blimey, my ’eart’s goin’

that fast...”

“So — so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?”

Harry prompted apologetically.

 

“Yeah,” said Stan, still rubbing his chest. “Yeah,

that’s right. Very close to You-Know-’Oo, they say.

Anyway, when little ’Arry Potter got the better of You-

Know-’Oo — ”

Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again.

“ — all You-Know-’Oo’s supporters was tracked down,

wasn’t they, Ern? Most of ’em knew it was all over,

wiv You-Know-’Oo gone, and they came quiet. But not

Sirius Black. I ’eard he thought ’e’d be second-in-

command once You-Know-’Oo ’ad taken over.

“Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street

full of Muggles an’ Black took out ’is wand and ’e

blasted ’alf the street apart, an’ a wizard got it, an’ so

did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. ’Orrible, eh?

An’ you know what Black did then?” Stan continued

in a dramatic whisper.

“What?” said Harry.

“Laughed,” said Stan. “Jus’ stood there an’ laughed.

An’ when reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic

got there, ’e went wiv ’em quiet as anyfink, still

laughing ’is ’ead off. ’Cos ’e’s mad, inee, Ern? Inee

mad?”

“If he weren’t when he went to Azkaban, he will be

now,” said Ern in his slow voice. “I’d blow meself up

before I set foot in that place. Serves him right, mind

you ... after what he did. ...”

“They ’ad a job coverin’ it up, din’ they, Ern?” Stan

said. “ ’Ole street blown up an’ all them Muggles

dead. What was it they said ’ad ’appened, Ern?”

“Gas explosion,” grunted Ernie.

 

“An’ now ’e’s out,” said Stan, examining the

newspaper picture of Black’s gaunt face again. “Never

been a breakout from Azkaban before, ’as there, Ern?

Beats me ’ow ’e did it. Frightenin’, eh? Mind, I don’t

fancy ’is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh,

Ern?”

Ernie suddenly shivered.

“Talk about summat else, Stan, there’s a good lad.

Them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.”

Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry

leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling

worse than ever. He couldn’t help imagining what

Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights’

time.

“ ’Ear about that ’Arry Potter? Blew up ’is aunt! We

’ad ’im ’ere on the Knight Bus, di’n’t we, Ern? ’E was

tryin’ to run for it. ...”

He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius

Black. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land

him in Azkaban? Harry didn’t know anything about

the wizard prison, though everyone he’d ever heard

speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the

Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there

only last year. Harry wouldn’t soon forget the look of

terror on Hagrid ’s face when he had been told where

he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest

people Harry knew.

The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness,

scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone

booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and

miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan

remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate,

but poured it all over Harry’s pillow when the bus

 

moved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen. One by

one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and

slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the

bus. They all looked very pleased to go.

Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.

“Right then, Neville,” said Stan, clapping his hands,

“whereabouts in London?”

“Diagon Alley,” said Harry.

“Righto,” said Stan. “ ’Old tight, then ...”

BANG!

They were thundering along Charing Cross Road.

Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches

squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus’s way.

The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low

for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the moment it

opened, then set off — where, he didn’t know.

Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus

skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby-

looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay

the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.

“Thanks,” Harry said to Ern.

He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his

trunk and Hedwig’s cage onto the pavement.

“Well,” said Harry. “ ’Bye then!”

But Stan wasn’t paying attention. Still standing in the

doorway to the bus, he was goggling at the shadowy

entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.

 

“ There you are, Harry,” said a voice.

Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his

shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, “Blimey!

Ern, come ’ere! Come ’ere!”

Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his

shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his

stomach — he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge,

the Minister of Magic himself.

Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.

“What didja call Neville, Minister?” he said excitedly.

Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak,

looked cold and exhausted.

“Neville?” he repeated, frowning. “This is Harry

Potter.”

“I knew it!” Stan shouted gleefully. “Ern! Ern! Guess

’oo Neville is, Ern! ’E’s ’Arry Potter! I can see ’is scar!”

“Yes,” said Fudge testily, “well, I’m very glad the

Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to

step inside the Leaky Cauldron now ...”

Fudge increased the pressure on Harry’s shoulder,

and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub.

A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through

the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the wizened,

toothless landlord.

“You’ve got him, Minister!” said Tom. “Will you be

wanting anything? Beer? Brandy?”

“Perhaps a pot of tea,” said Fudge, who still hadn’t let

go of Harry.

 

There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind

them, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry’s

trunk and Hedwig’s cage and looking around

excitedly.

“ ’Ow come you di’n’t tell us ’oo you are, eh, Neville?”

said Stan, beaming at Harry, while Ernie’s owlish face

peered interestedly over Stan’s shoulder.

“And a private parlor, please, Tom,” said Fudge

pointedly.

“ ’Bye,” Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom

beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the

bar.

“ ’Bye, Neville!” called Stan.

Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after

Tom’s lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom

clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate,

and he bowed himself out of the room.

“Sit down, Harry,” said Fudge, indicating a chair by

the fire.

Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his

arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his

pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up

the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down

opposite Harry.

“I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.”

Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen

Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his

father’s Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn’t to

know that.

 

Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over

his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets.

He placed the tray on a table between Fudge and

Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind

him.

“Well, Harry,” said Fudge, pouring out tea, “you’ve

had us all in a right flap, I don’t mind telling you.

Running away from your aunt and uncle’s house like

that! I’d started to think ... but you’re safe, and that’s

what matters.”

Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the

plate toward Harry.

“Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then ...

You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with

the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley.

Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad

were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss

Dursley has been punctured and her memory has

been modified. She has no recollection of the incident

at all. So that’s that, and no harm done.”

Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup,

rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew.

Harry, who couldn’t believe his ears, opened his

mouth to speak, couldn’t think of anything to say,

and closed it again.

“Ah, you’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt

and uncle?” said Fudge. “Well, I won’t deny that they

are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to

take you back next summer as long as you stay at

Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.”

Harry unstuck his throat.

 

“I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and

Easter holidays,” he said, “and I don’t ever want to go

back to Privet Drive.”

“Now, now, I’m sure you’ll feel differently once you’ve

calmed down,” said Fudge in a worried tone. “They

are your family, after all, and I’m sure you are fond of

each other — er — very deep down.”

It didn’t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was

still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him

now.

“So all that remains,” said Fudge, now buttering

himself a second crumpet, “is to decide where you’re

going to spend the last three weeks of your vacation. I

suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron

and — ”

“Hang on,” blurted Harry. “What about my

punishment?”

Fudge blinked.

“Punishment?”

“I broke the law!” Harry said. “The Decree for the

Restriction of Underage Wizardry!”

“Oh, my dear boy, we’re not going to punish you for a

little thing like that!” cried Fudge, waving his crumpet

impatiently. “It was an accident! We don’t send people

to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!”

But this didn’t tally at all with Harry’s past dealings

with the Ministry of Magic.

“Last year, I got an official warning just because a

house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle’s house!”

 

he told Fudge, frowning. “The Ministry of Magic said

I’d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more

magic there!”

Unless Harry’s eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was

suddenly looking awkward.

“Circumstances change, Harry. ... We have to take

into account ... in the present climate . . . Surely you

don’t want to be expelled?”

“Of course I don’t,” said Harry.

“Well then, what’s all the fuss about?” laughed Fudge.

“Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if

Tom’s got a room for you.”

Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after

him. There was something extremely odd going on.

Why had Fudge been waiting for him at the Leaky

Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he’d done?

And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn’t

usual for the Minister of Magic himself to get involved

in matters of underage magic?

Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the

innkeeper.

“Room eleven’s free, Harry,” said Fudge. “I think you’ll

be very comfortable. Just one thing, and I’m sure

you’ll understand ... I don’t want you wandering off

into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon Alley.

And you’re to be back here before dark each night.

Sure you’ll understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on

you for me.”

“Okay,” said Harry slowly, “but why — ?”

 

“Don’t want to lose you again, do we?” said Fudge

with a hearty laugh. “No, no ... best we know where

you are. ... I mean ...”

Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his

pinstriped cloak.

“Well, I’ll be off, plenty to do, you know. ...”

“Have you had any luck with Black yet?” Harry asked.

Fudge’s finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his

cloak.

“What’s that? Oh, you’ve heard — well, no, not yet,

but it’s only a matter of time. The Azkaban guards

have never yet failed ... and they are angrier than I’ve

ever seen them.”

Fudge shuddered slightly.

“So, I’ll say good-bye.”

He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a

sudden idea.

“Er — Minister? Can I ask you something?”

“Certainly,” said Fudge with a smile.

“Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit

Hogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn’t sign the

permission form. D’you think you could — ?”

Fudge was looking uncomfortable.

“Ah,” he said. “No, no, I’m very sorry, Harry, but as

I’m not your parent or guardian — ”

 

“But you’re the Minister of Magic,” said Harry eagerly.

“If you gave me permission — ”

“No, I’m sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,” said Fudge

flatly. “Perhaps you’ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next

year. In fact, I think it’s best if you don’t ... yes ...

well, I’ll be off. Enjoy your stay, Harry.”

And with a last smile and shake of Harry’s hand,

Fudge left the room. Tom now moved forward,

beaming at Harry.

“If you’ll follow me, Mr. Potter,” he said, “I’ve already

taken your things up. ...”

Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase

to a door with a brass number eleven on it, which

Tom unlocked and opened for him.

Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some

highly polished oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling

fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe —

“Hedwig!” Harry gasped.

The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down

onto Harry’s arm.

“Very smart owl you’ve got there,” chuckled Tom.

“Arrived about five minutes after you did. If there’s

anything you need, Mr. Potter, don’t hesitate to ask.”

He gave another bow and left.

Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly

stroking Hedwig. The sky outside the window was

changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold,

steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold.

Harry could hardly believe that he’d left Privet Drive

 

only a few hours ago, that he wasn’t expelled, and

that he was now facing three Dursley-free weeks.

“It’s been a very weird night, Hedwig,” he yawned.

And without even removing his glasses, he slumped

back onto his pillows and fell asleep.

 

THE LEAKY CAULDRON

It took Harry several days to get used to his strange

new freedom. Never before had he been able to get up

whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied. He

could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was

in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was

packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in

the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to

Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.

Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky

Cauldron, where he liked watching the other guests:

funny little witches from the country, up for a day’s

shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the

latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking

warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked

suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw

liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.

After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard,

take out his wand, tap the third brick from the left

above the trash bin, and stand back as the archway

into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.

 

Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops

and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas

outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing

one another their purchases (“it’s a lunascope, old

boy — no more messing around with moon charts,

see?”) or else discussing the case of Sirius Black

(“personally, I won’t let any of the children out alone

until he’s back in Azkaban”). Harry didn’t have to do

his homework under the blankets by flashlight

anymore; now he could sit in the bright sunshine

outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor,

finishing all his essays with occasional help from

Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a

great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry

free sundaes every half an hour.

Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold

Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his

vault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a lot of self-

control not to spend the whole lot at once. He had to

keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at

Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys

for money for spellbooks, to stop himself from buying

a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding

game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a

nasty-smelling liquid into the other player’s face when

they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the

perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass

ball, which would have meant he never had to take

another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested

Harry’s resolution most appeared in his favorite shop,

Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he’d arrived

at the Leaky Cauldron.

Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was

staring at, Harry edged his way inside and squeezed

in among the excited witches and wizards until he

glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was

 

mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever

seen in his life.

“Just come out — prototype — ” a square-jawed

wizard was telling his companion.

“It’s the fastest broom in the world, isn’t it, Dad?”

squeaked a boy younger than Harry, who was

swinging off his father’s arm.

“Irish International Side’s just put in an order for

seven of these beauties!” the proprietor of the shop

told the crowd. “And they’re favorites for the World

Cup!”

A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was

able to read the sign next to the broom:

THE FIREBOLT

This state-of-the-art racing broom sports a stream-

lined, superfine handle of ash, treated with a

diamond-hard polish and hand-numbered with its

own registration number. Each individually selected

birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to

aerodynamic perfection, giving the Firebolt

unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision. The

Firebolt has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in

ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable

Braking Charm. Price on request.

Price on request ... Harry didn’t like to think how

much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never

wanted anything as much in his whole life — but he

had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two

Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his

Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very

good broom already? Harry didn’t ask for the price,

 

but he returned, almost every day after that, just to

look at the Firebolt.

There were, however, things that Harry needed to

buy. He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store

of potions ingredients, and as his school robes were

now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he

visited Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions and

bought new ones. Most important of all, he had to

buy his new schoolbooks, which would include those

for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures

and Divination.

Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop

window. Instead of the usual display of gold-

embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there

was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about

a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters.

Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books

grappled with each other, locked together in furious

wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.

Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and

consulted it for the first time. The Monster Book of

Monsters was listed as the required book for Care of

Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid

had said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he

had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with

some terrifying new pet.

As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager

came hurrying toward him.

“Hogwarts?” he said abruptly. “Come to get your new

books?”

“Yes,” said Harry, “I need — ”

 

“Get out of the way,” said the manager impatiently,

brushing Harry aside. He drew on a pair of very thick

gloves, picked up a large, knobbly walking stick, and

proceeded toward the door of the Monster Books’ cage.

“Hang on,” said Harry quickly, “I’ve already got one of

those.”

“Have you?” A look of enormous relief spread over the

manager’s face. “Thank heavens for that. I’ve been

bitten five times already this morning — ”

A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster

Books had seized a third and were pulling it apart.

“Stop it! Stop it!” cried the manager, poking the

walking stick through the bars and knocking the

books apart. “I’m never stocking them again, never!

It’s been bedlam! I thought we’d seen the worst when

we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of

Invisibility — cost a fortune, and we never found

them. ... Well ... is there anything else I can help you

with?”

“Yes,” said Harry, looking down his booklist, “I need

Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.”

“Ah, starting Divination, are you?” said the manager,

stripping off his gloves and leading Harry into the

back of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to

fortune-telling. A small table was stacked with

volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate

Yourself Against Shocks and Broken Balls: When

Fortunes Turn Foul.

“Here you are,” said the manager, who had climbed a

set of steps to take down a thick, black-bound book.

“Unfogging the Future. Very good guide to all your

 

basic fortune-telling methods — palmistry, crystal

balls, bird entrails — ”

But Harry wasn’t listening. His eyes had fallen on

another book, which was among a display on a small

table: Death Omens: What to Do When You Know the

Worst Is Coming.

“Oh, I wouldn’t read that if I were you,” said the

manager lightly, looking to see what Harry was

staring at. “You’ll start seeing death omens

everywhere. It’s enough to frighten anyone to death.”

But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the

book; it showed a black dog large as a bear, with

gleaming eyes. It looked oddly familiar. ...

The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into

Harry’s hands.

“Anything else?” he said.

“Yes,” said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the

dog’s and dazedly consulting his booklist. “Er — I

need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard

Book of Spells, Grade Three.”

Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes

later with his new books under his arms and made

his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing

where he was going and bumping into several people.

He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside,

and tipped his books onto his bed. Somebody had

been in to tidy; the windows were open and sun was

pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by

in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the

sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley. He

caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin.

 

“It can’t have been a death omen,” he told his

reflection defiantly. “I was panicking when I saw that

thing in Magnolia Crescent. ... It was probably just a

stray dog. ...”

He raised his hand automatically and tried to make

his hair lie flat.

“You’re fighting a losing battle there, dear,” said his

mirror in a wheezy voice.

As the days slipped by, Harry started looking

wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione.

Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon

Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met

Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow

Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where

they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the

real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy,

outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn’t stop to chat;

Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was

being told off by his very formidable-looking

grandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that

he’d pretended to be Neville while on the run from the

Ministry of Magic.

Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking

that he would at least meet Ron and Hermione

tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got up,

dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was

just wondering where he’d have lunch, when someone

yelled his name and he turned.

“Harry! HARRY!”

They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean

Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor — Ron looking

incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving

frantically at him.

 

“Finally!” said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down.

“We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you’d

left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam

Malkin’s, and — ”

“I got all my school stuff last week,” Harry explained.

“And how come you knew I’m staying at the Leaky

Cauldron?”

“Dad,” said Ron simply.

Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic,

would of course have heard the whole story of what

had happened to Aunt Marge.

“Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?” said

Hermione in a very serious voice.

“I didn’t mean to,” said Harry while Ron roared with

laughter. “I just — lost control.”

“It’s not funny, Ron,” said Hermione sharply.

“Honestly, I’m amazed Harry wasn’t expelled.”

“So am I,” admitted Harry. “Forget expelled, I thought

I was going to be arrested.” He looked at Ron. “Your

dad doesn’t know why Fudge let me off, does he?”

“Probably ’cause it’s you, isn’t it?” shrugged Ron, still

chuckling. “Famous Harry Potter and all that. I’d hate

to see what the Ministry’d do to me if I blew up an

aunt. Mind you, they’d have to dig me up first,

because Mum would’ve killed me. Anyway, you can

ask Dad yourself this evening. We’re staying at the

Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to

King’s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione’s there as

well!”

 

Hermione nodded, beaming. “Mum and Dad dropped

me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.”

“Excellent!” said Harry happily. “So, have you got all

your new books and stuff?”

“Look at this,” said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of

a bag and opening it. “Brand-new wand. Fourteen

inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And

we’ve got all our books — ” He pointed at a large bag

under his chair. “What about those Monster Books,

eh? The assistant nearly cried when we said we

wanted two.”

“What’s all that, Hermione?” Harry asked, pointing at

not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to

her.

“Well, I’m taking more new subjects than you, aren’t

I?” said Hermione. “Those are my books for

Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination,

Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies — ”

“What are you doing Muggle Studies for?” said Ron,

rolling his eyes at Harry. “You’re Muggle-born! Your

mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all

about Muggles!”

“But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the

wizarding point of view,” said Hermione earnestly.

“Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year,

Hermione?” asked Harry, while Ron sniggered.

Hermione ignored them.

“I’ve still got ten Galleons,” she said, checking her

purse. “It’s my birthday in September, and Mum and

Dad gave me some money to get myself an early

birthday present.”

 

“How about a nice book?” said Ron innocently.

“No, I don’t think so,” said Hermione composedly. “I

really want an owl. I mean, Harry’s got Hedwig and

you’ve got Errol — ”

“I haven’t,” said Ron. “Errol’s a family owl. All I’ve got

is Scabbers.” He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket.

“And I want to get him checked over,” he added,

placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. “I

don’t think Egypt agreed with him.”

Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there

was a definite droop to his whiskers.

“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said

Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now. “You

could see if they’ve got anything for Scabbers, and

Hermione can get her owl.”

So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street

to the Magical Menagerie.

There wasn’t much room inside. Every inch of wall

was hidden by cages. It was smelly and very noisy

because the occupants of these cages were all

squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The

witch behind the counter was already advising a

wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry,

Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.

A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly

and feasting on dead blowflies. A gigantic tortoise

with a jewel-encrusted shell was glittering near the

window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly

up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit

kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with

a loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every

color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny

 

custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly,

and on the counter, a vast cage of sleek black rats

that were playing some sort of skipping game using

their long, bald tails.

The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron

approached the counter.

“It’s my rat,” he told the witch. “He been a bit off-color

ever since I brought him back from Egypt.”

“Bang him on the counter,” said the witch, pulling a

pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket.

Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and

placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats, who

stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire

for a better look.

Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat

was secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron’s

brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the glossy

rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.

“Hm,” said the witch, picking up Scabbers. “How old

is this rat?”

“Dunno,” said Ron. “Quite old. He used to belong to

my brother.”

“What powers does he have?” said the witch,

examining Scabbers closely.

“Er — ” The truth was that Scabbers had never shown

the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witch’s

eyes moved from Scabbers ’s tattered left ear to his

front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted

loudly.

 

“He’s been through the mill, this one,” she said.

“He was like that when Percy gave him to me,” said

Ron defensively.

“An ordinary common or garden rat like this can’t be

expected to live longer than three years or so,” said

the witch. “Now, if you were looking for something a

bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these — ”

She indicated the black rats, who promptly started

skipping again. Ron muttered, “Show-offs.”

“Well, if you don’t want a replacement, you can try

this rat tonic,” said the witch, reaching under the

counter and bringing out a small red bottle.

“Okay,” said Ron. “How much — OUCH!”

Ron buckled as something huge and orange came

soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on

his head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at

Scabbers.

“NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!” cried the witch, but

Scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of

soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then

scampered for the door.

“Scabbers!” Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after

him; Harry followed.

It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers,

who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside

Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling

rat back into his pocket and straightened up,

massaging his head.

“What was that?”

 

“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,”

said Harry.

“Where’s Hermione?”

“Probably getting her owl — ”

They made their way back up the crowded street to

the Magical Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione

came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her arms

were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.

“You bought that monster?” said Ron, his mouth

hanging open.

“He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.

That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The

cat’s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was

definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy

and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong

into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight,

however, the cat was purring contentedly in

Hermione ’s arms.

“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.

“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said

Hermione.

“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the

lump in his chest pocket. “He needs rest and

relaxation! How’s he going to get it with that thing

around?”

“That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,” said

Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron’s

hand. “And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be

sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours,

 

what’s the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch

said he’d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.”

“I wonder why,” said Ron sarcastically as they set off

toward the Leaky Cauldron.

They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the

Daily Prophet.

“Harry!” he said, smiling as he looked up. “How are

you?”

“Fine, thanks,” said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione

joined Mr. Weasley with all their shopping.

Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the

now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him.

“They still haven’t caught him, then?” he asked.

“No,” said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave.

“They’ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the

Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.”

“Would we get a reward if we caught him?” asked

Ron. “It’d be good to get some more money — ”

“Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” said Mr. Weasley, who on

closer inspection looked very strained. “Black’s not

going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It’s

the Azkaban guards who’ll get him back, you mark

my words.”

At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden

with shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred

and George, who were about to start their fifth year at

Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the

Weasleys’ youngest child and only girl, Ginny.

 

Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry,

seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual

when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved

her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She

went very red and muttered “hello” without looking at

him. Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as

though he and Harry had never met and said, “Harry.

How nice to see you.”

“Hello, Percy,” said Harry, trying not to laugh.

“I hope you’re well?” said Percy pompously, shaking

hands. It was rather like being introduced to the

mayor.

“Very well, thanks — ”

“Harry!” said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and

bowing deeply. “Simply splendid to see you, old boy —

“Marvelous,” said George, pushing Fred aside and

seizing Harry’s hand in turn. “Absolutely spiffing.”

Percy scowled.

“That’s enough, now,” said Mrs. Weasley.

“Mum!” said Fred as though he’d only just spotted her

and seizing her hand too. “How really corking to see

you — ”

“I said, that’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley, depositing

her shopping in an empty chair. “Hello, Harry, dear. I

suppose you’ve heard our exciting news?” She pointed

to the brand-new silver badge on Percy’s chest.

“Second Head Boy in the family!” she said, swelling

with pride.

 

“And last,” Fred muttered under his breath.

“I don’t doubt that,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning

suddenly. “I notice they haven’t made you two

prefects.”

“What do we want to be prefects for?” said George,

looking revolted at the very idea. “It’d take all the fun

out of life.”

Ginny giggled.

“You want to set a better example for your sister!”

snapped Mrs. Weasley.

“Ginny’s got other brothers to set her an example,

Mother,” said Percy loftily. “I’m going up to change for

dinner. ...”

He disappeared and George heaved a sigh.

“We tried to shut him in a pyramid,” he told Harry.

“But Mum spotted us.”

Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the

innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and

the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their

way through five delicious courses.

“How’re we getting to King’s Cross tomorrow, Dad?”

asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate

pudding.

“The Ministry’s providing a couple of cars,” said Mr.

Weasley.

Everyone looked up at him.

“Why?” said Percy curiously.

 

“It’s because of you, Perce,” said George seriously.

“And there’ll be little flags on the hoods, with HB on

them — ”

“ — for Humongous Bighead,” said Fred.

Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into

their pudding.

“Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?” Percy

asked again, in a dignified voice.

“Well, as we haven’t got one anymore,” said Mr.

Weasley, “ — and as I work there, they’re doing me a

favor — ”

His voice was casual, but Harry couldn’t help noticing

that Mr. Weasley’s ears had gone red, just like Ron’s

did when he was under pressure.

“Good thing, too,” said Mrs. Weasley briskly. “Do you

realize how much luggage you’ve all got between you?

A nice sight you’d be on the Muggle Underground. ...

You are all packed, aren’t you?”

“Ron hasn’t put all his new things in his trunk yet,”

said Percy, in a long-suffering voice. “He’s dumped

them on my bed.”

“You’d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we

won’t have much time in the morning,” Mrs. Weasley

called down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.

After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by

one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to

check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy

were next door to Harry. He had just closed and

locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices

through the wall, and went to see what was going on.

 

The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was

shouting.

“It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for

polishing — ”

“I haven’t touched it, all right?” Ron roared back.

“What’s up?” said Harry.

“My Head Boy badge is gone,” said Percy, rounding on

Harry.

“So’s Scabbers’s rat tonic,” said Ron, throwing things

out of his trunk to look. “I think I might’ve left it in

the bar — ”

“You’re not going anywhere till you’ve found my

badge!” yelled Percy.

“I’ll get Scabbers’s stuff, I’m packed,” Harry said to

Ron, and he went downstairs.

Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar,

which was now very dark, when he heard another

pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second

later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs. Weasleys’.

He hesitated, not wanting them to know he’d heard

them arguing, when the sound of his own name made

him stop, then move closer to the parlor door.

“... makes no sense not to tell him,” Mr. Weasley was

saying heatedly. “Harry’s got a right to know. I’ve tried

to tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a

child. He’s thirteen years old and — ”

“Arthur, the truth would terrify him!” said Mrs.

Weasley shrilly. “Do you really want to send Harry

 

back to school with that hanging over him? For

heaven’s sake, he’s happy not knowing!”

“I don’t want to make him miserable, I want to put

him on his guard!” retorted Mr. Weasley. “You know

what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by

themselves — they’ve even ended up in the Forbidden

Forest! But Harry mustn’t do that this year! When I

think what could have happened to him that night he

ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn’t picked

him up, I’m prepared to bet he would have been dead

before the Ministry found him.”

“But he’s not dead, he’s fine, so what’s the point — ”

“Molly, they say Sirius Black’s mad, and maybe he is,

but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban,

and that’s supposed to be impossible. It’s been a

month, and no one’s seen hide nor hair of him, and I

don’t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet,

we’re no nearer catching Black than inventing self-

spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is

what Black’s after — ”

“But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.”

“We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can

break out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.”

“But no one’s really sure that Black’s after Harry — ”

There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr.

Weasley had banged his fist on the table.

“Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They

didn’t report it in the press because Fudge wanted it

kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night

Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Black’s

been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the

 

same words: ‘He’s at Hogwarts ... he’s at Hogwarts.’

Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If

you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring

You-Know-Who back to power. Black lost everything

the night Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and he’s had

twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that. ...”

There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the

door, desperate to hear more.

“Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right.

But you’re forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don’t think

anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while

Dumbledore ’s headmaster. I suppose he knows about

all this?”

“Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds

the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the

entrances to the school grounds. He wasn’t happy

about it, but he agreed.”

“Not happy? Why shouldn’t he be happy, if they’re

there to catch Black?”

“Dumbledore isn’t fond of the Azkaban guards,” said

Mr. Weasley heavily. “Nor am I, if it comes to that ...

but when you’re dealing with a wizard like Black, you

sometimes have to join forces with those you’d rather

avoid.”

“If they save Harry — ”

“ — then I will never say another word against them,”

said Mr. Weasley wearily. “It’s late, Molly, we’d better

go up. ...”

Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he

hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight.

The parlor door opened, and a few seconds later

 

footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were

climbing the stairs.

The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they

had sat at earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr.

and Mrs. Weasley’s bedroom door close, then headed

back upstairs with the bottle.

Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on

the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to

Percy dismantling his and Ron’s room in search of his

badge.

“We’ve got it,” Fred whispered to Harry. “We’ve been

improving it.”

The badge now read BigheacL Boy.

Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic,

then shut himself in his room and lay down on his

bed.

So Sirius Black was after him. This explained

everything. Fudge had been lenient with him because

he was so relieved to find him alive. He’d made Harry

promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were

plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was

sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the

station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look

after Harry until he was on the train.

Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door

and wondered why he didn’t feel more scared. Sirius

Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse;

Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously thought Harry would

be panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry

happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley

that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus

Dumbledore happened to be. Didn’t people always say

 

that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort

had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort’s

right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?

And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone

kept talking about. They seemed to scare most people

senseless, and if they were stationed all around the

school, Black’s chances of getting inside seemed very

remote.

No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was

the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now

looked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave

the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in

fact, Harry suspected his every move would be

carefully watched until the danger had passed.

He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he

couldn’t look after himself? He’d escaped Lord

Voldemort three times; he wasn’t completely useless.

Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of

Magnolia Crescent crossed his mind. What to do when

you know the worst is coming. . . .

“I’m not going to be murdered,” Harry said out loud.

“That’s the spirit, dear,” said his mirror sleepily.

THE DEMENTOR

Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual

toothless grin and a cup of tea. Harry got dressed and

was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back

into her cage when Ron banged his way into the

room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking

irritable.

“The sooner we get on the train, the better,” he said.

“At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now

he’s accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of

Penelope Clearwater. You know,” Ron grimaced, “his

girlfriend. She’s hidden her face under the frame

because her nose has gone all blotchy. ...”

“I’ve got something to tell you,” Harry began, but they

were interrupted by Fred and George, who had looked

in to congratulate Ron on infuriating Percy again.

They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley

was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a

furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling

 

Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she’d made

as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.

“What were you saying?” Ron asked Harry as they sat

down.

“Later,” Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.

Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in

the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all

their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron’s narrow

staircase and piling them up near the door, with

Hedwig and Hermes, Percy’s screech owl, perched on

top in their cages. A small wickerwork basket stood

beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.

“It’s all right, Crookshanks,” Hermione cooed through

the wickerwork. “I’ll let you out on the train.”

“You won’t,” snapped Ron. “What about poor

Scabbers, eh?”

He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated

that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket.

Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the

Ministry cars, stuck his head inside.

“They’re here,” he said. “Harry, come on.”

Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch

of pavement toward the first of two old-fashioned dark

green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive-

looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.

“In you get, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and

down the crowded street.

 

Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly

joined by Hermione, Ron, and, to Ron’s disgust,

Percy.

The journey to King’s Cross was very uneventful

compared with Harry’s trip on the Knight Bus. The

Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary,

though Harry noticed that they could slide through

gaps that Uncle Vernon’s new company car certainly

couldn’t have managed. They reached King’s Cross

with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers

found them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched

their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away,

somehow managing to jump to the head of an

unmoving line at the traffic lights.

Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry’s elbow all the way

into the station.

“Right then,” he said, glancing around them. “Let’s do

this in pairs, as there are so many of us. I’ll go

through first with Harry.”

Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between

platforms nine and ten, pushing Harry’s trolley and

apparently very interested in the Intercity 125 that

had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful

look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier.

Harry imitated him.

In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the

solid metal onto platform nine and three-quarters and

looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet

steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed

with witches and wizards seeing their children onto

the train.

 

Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry.

They were panting and had apparently taken the

barrier at a run.

“Ah, there’s Penelope!” said Percy, smoothing his hair

and going pink again. Ginny caught Harry’s eye, and

they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy

strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with

his chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his

shiny badge.

Once the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had

joined them, Harry and Ron led the way to the end of

the train, past packed compartments, to a carriage

that looked quite empty. They loaded the trunks onto

it, stowed Hedwig and Crookshanks in the luggage

rack, then went back outside to say good-bye to Mr.

and Mrs. Weasley.

Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione,

and finally, Harry. He was embarrassed, but really

quite pleased, when she gave him an extra hug.

“Do take care, won’t you, Harry?” she said as she

straightened up, her eyes oddly bright. Then she

opened her enormous handbag and said, “I’ve made

you all sandwiches. ... Here you are, Ron ... no,

they’re not corned beef. ... Fred? Where’s Fred? Here

you are, dear. ...”

“Harry,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “come over here a

moment.”

He jerked his head toward a pillar, and Harry followed

him behind it, leaving the others crowded around

Mrs. Weasley.

“There’s something I’ve got to tell you before you leave

— ” said Mr. Weasley, in a tense voice.

 

“It’s all right, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry. “I already

know.”

“You know? How could you know?”

“I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last

night. I couldn’t help hearing,” Harry added quickly.

“Sorry — ”

“That’s not the way I’d have chosen for you to find

out,” said Mr. Weasley, looking anxious.

“No — honestly, it’s okay. This way, you haven’t

broken your word to Fudge and I know what’s going

on.”

“Harry, you must be very scared — ”

“I’m not,” said Harry sincerely. “Really” he added,

because Mr. Weasley was looking disbelieving. “I’m

not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius Black

can’t be worse than Voldemort, can he?”

Mr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name but

overlooked it.

“Harry, I knew you were, well, made of stronger stuff

than Fudge seems to think, and I’m obviously pleased

that you’re not scared, but — ”

“Arthur!” called Mrs. Weasley, who was now

shepherding the rest onto the train. “Arthur, what are

you doing? It’s about to go!”

“He’s coming, Molly!” said Mr. Weasley but he turned

back to Harry and kept talking in a lower and more

hurried voice. “Listen, I want you to give me your

word — ”

 

“ — that I’ll be a good boy and stay in the castle?” said

Harry gloomily.

“Not entirely,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked more

serious than Harry had ever seen him. “Harry, swear

to me you won’t go looking for Black.”

Harry stared. “What?”

There was a loud whistle. Guards were walking along

the train, slamming all the doors shut.

“Promise me, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, talking more

quickly still, “that whatever happens — ”

“Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to

kill me?” said Harry blankly.

“Swear to me that whatever you might hear — ”

“Arthur, quickly!” cried Mrs. Weasley.

Steam was billowing from the train; it had started to

move. Harry ran to the compartment door and Ron

threw it open and stood back to let him on. They

leaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs.

Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked

them from view.

“I need to talk to you in private,” Harry muttered to

Ron and Hermione as the train picked up speed.

“Go away, Ginny,” said Ron.

“Oh, that’s nice,” said Ginny huffily, and she stalked

off.

 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor,

looking for an empty compartment, but all were full

except for the one at the very end of the train.

This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep

next to the window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione

checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts Express was

usually reserved for students and they had never seen

an adult there before, except for the witch who

pushed the food cart.

The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of

wizard’s robes that had been darned in several places.

He looked ill and exhausted. Though quite young, his

light brown hair was flecked with gray.

“Who d’you reckon he is?” Ron hissed as they sat

down and slid the door shut, taking the seats farthest

away from the window.

“Professor R. J. Lupin,” whispered Hermione at once.

“How d’you know that?”

“It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage

rack over the man’s head, where there was a small,

battered case held together with a large quantity of

neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin

was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.

“Wonder what he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at

Professor Lupin’s pallid profile.

“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only

one vacancy, isn’t there? Defense Against the Dark

Arts.”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two

Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of

 

whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors

that the job was jinxed.

“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He

looks like one good hex would finish him off, doesn’t

he? Anyway ...” He turned to Harry. “What were you

going to tell us?”

Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s

argument and the warning Mr. Weasley had just

given him. When he’d finished, Ron looked

thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her

mouth. She finally lowered them to say, “Sirius Black

escaped to come after you? Oh, Harry ... you’ll have to

be really, really careful. Don’t go looking for trouble,

Harry — ”

“I don’t go looking for trouble,” said Harry, nettled.

“Trouble usually finds me.”

“How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a

nutter who wants to kill him?” said Ron shakily.

They were taking the news worse than Harry had

expected. Both Ron and Hermione seemed to be much

more frightened of Black than he was.

“No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,” said Ron

uncomfortably. “No one’s ever done it before. And he

was a top-security prisoner too.”

“But they’ll catch him, won’t they?” said Hermione

earnestly. “I mean, they’ve got all the Muggles looking

out for him too. ...”

“What’s that noise?” said Ron suddenly.

A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from

somewhere. They looked all around the compartment.

 

“It’s coming from your trunk, Harry,” said Ron,

standing up and reaching into the luggage rack. A

moment later he had pulled the Pocket Sneakoscope

out from between Harry’s robes. It was spinning very

fast in the palm of Ron’s hand and glowing brilliantly.

“Is that a Sneakoscope?” said Hermione interestedly,

standing up for a better look.

“Yeah ... mind you, it’s a very cheap one,” Ron said.

“It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol’s leg to

send it to Harry.”

“Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?”

said Hermione shrewdly.

“No! Well ... I wasn’t supposed to be using Errol. You

know he’s not really up to long journeys ... but how

else was I supposed to get Harry’s present to him?”

“Stick it back in the trunk,” Harry advised as the

Sneakoscope whistled piercingly, “or it’ll wake him

up.”

He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the

Sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle

Vernon’s old socks, which deadened the sound, then

closed the lid of the trunk on it.

“We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,” said Ron,

sitting back down. “They sell that sort of thing in

Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff.

Fred and George told me.”

“Do you know much about Hogsmeade?” asked

Hermione keenly. “I’ve read it’s the only entirely non-

Muggle settlement in Britain — ”

 

“Yeah, I think it is,” said Ron in an offhand sort of

way, “but that’s not why I want to go. I just want to

get inside Honeydukes!”

“What’s that?” said Hermione.

“It’s this sweetshop,” said Ron, a dreamy look coming

over his face, “where they’ve got everything. ... Pepper

Imps — they make you smoke at the mouth — and

great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and

clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which

you can suck in class and just look like you’re

thinking what to write next — ”

“But Hogsmeade’s a very interesting place, isn’t it?”

Hermione pressed on eagerly. “In Sites of Historical

Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the

1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack’s

supposed to be the most severely haunted building in

Britain — ”

“ — and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a

few inches off the ground while you’re sucking them,”

said Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word

Hermione was saying.

Hermione looked around at Harry.

“Won’t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and

explore Hogsmeade?”

“ ’Spect it will,” said Harry heavily. “You’ll have to tell

me when you’ve found out.”

“What d’you mean?” said Ron.

“I can’t go. The Dursleys didn’t sign my permission

form, and Fudge wouldn’t either.”

 

Ron looked horrified.

“You’re not allowed to come? But — no way —

McGonagall or someone will give you permission — ”

Harry gave a hollow laugh. Professor McGonagall,

head of Gryffindor House, was very strict.

“ — or we can ask Fred and George, they know every

secret passage out of the castle — ”

“Ron!” said Hermione sharply. “I don’t think Harry

should be sneaking out of school with Black on the

loose — ”

“Yeah, I expect that’s what McGonagall will say when

I ask for permission,” said Harry bitterly.

“But if we’re with him,” said Ron spiritedly to

Hermione, “Black wouldn’t dare — ”

“Oh, Ron, don’t talk rubbish,” snapped Hermione.

“Black’s already murdered a whole bunch of people in

the middle of a crowded street. Do you really think

he’s going to worry about attacking Harry just

because we’re there?”

She was fumbling with the straps of Crookshanks’s

basket as she spoke.

“Don’t let that thing out!” Ron said, but too late;

Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched,

yawned, and sprang onto Ron’s knees; the lump in

Ron’s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks

angrily away.

“Get out of here!”

“Ron, don’t!” said Hermione angrily.

 

Ron was about to answer back when Professor Lupin

stirred. They watched him apprehensively, but he

simply turned his head the other way, mouth slightly

open, and slept on.

The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the

scenery outside the window became wilder and darker

while the clouds overhead thickened. People were

chasing backward and forward past the door of their

compartment. Crookshanks had now settled in an

empty seat, his squashed face turned toward Ron, his

yellow eyes on Ron’s top pocket.

At one o’clock, the plump witch with the food cart

arrived at the compartment door.

“D’you think we should wake him up?” Ron asked

awkwardly, nodding toward Professor Lupin. “He

looks like he could do with some food.”

Hermione approached Professor Lupin cautiously.

“Er — Professor?” she said. “Excuse me — Professor?”

He didn’t move.

“Don’t worry, dear,” said the witch as she handed

Harry a large stack of Cauldron Cakes. “If he’s hungry

when he wakes, I’ll be up front with the driver.”

“I suppose he is asleep?” said Ron quietly as the witch

slid the compartment door closed. “I mean — he

hasn’t died, has he?”

“No, no, he’s breathing,” whispered Hermione, taking

the Cauldron Cake Harry passed her.

He might not be very good company, but Professor

Lupin’s presence in their compartment had its uses.

 

Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring

the rolling hills outside the window, they heard

footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least

favorite people appeared at the door: Draco Malfoy,

flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory

Goyle.

Draco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since

they had met on their very first train journey to

Hogwarts. Malfoy, who had a pale, pointed, sneering

face, was in Slytherin House; he played Seeker on the

Slytherin Quidditch team, the same position that

Harry played on the Gryffindor team. Crabbe and

Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy’s bidding. They

were both wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with

a pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle

had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.

“Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy

drawl, pulling open the compartment door. “Potty and

the Weasel.”

Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.

“I heard your father finally got his hands on some

gold this summer, Weasley,” said Malfoy. “Did your

mother die of shock?”

Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks’s

basket to the floor. Professor Lupin gave a snort.

“Who’s that?” said Malfoy, taking an automatic step

backward as he spotted Lupin.

“New teacher,” said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in

case he needed to hold Ron back. “What were you

saying, Malfoy?”

 

Malfoy’s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn’t fool enough to

pick a fight right under a teacher’s nose.

“C’mon,” he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and

Goyle, and they disappeared.

Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his

knuckles.

“I’m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,”

he said angrily. “I mean it. If he makes one more

crack about my family, I’m going to get hold of his

head and — ”

Ron made a violent gesture in midair.

“Ron,” hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin,

“be careful ...”

But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.

The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north;

the windows were now a solid, shimmering gray,

which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into

life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks.

The train rattled, the rain hammered, the wind

roared, but still, Professor Lupin slept.

“We must be nearly there,” said Ron, leaning forward

to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely

black window.

The words had hardly left him when the train started

to slow down.

“Great,” said Ron, getting up and walking carefully

past Professor Lupin to try and see outside. “I’m

starving. I want to get to the feast. ...”

 

“We can’t be there yet,” said Hermione, checking her

watch.

“So why’re we stopping?”

The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise

of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded

louder than ever against the windows.

Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into

the corridor. All along the carriage, heads were

sticking curiously out of their compartments.

The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds

and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of

the racks. Then, without warning, all the lamps went

out and they were plunged into total darkness.

“What’s going on?” said Ron’s voice from behind

Harry.

“Ouch!” gasped Hermione. “Ron, that was my foot!”

Harry felt his way back to his seat.

“D’you think we’ve broken down?”

“Dunno ...”

There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim

black outline of Ron, wiping a patch clean on the

window and peering out.

“There’s something moving out there,” Ron said. “I

think people are coming aboard. ...”

The compartment door suddenly opened and someone

fell painfully over Harry’s legs.

 

“Sorry — d’you know what’s going on? — Ouch —

sorry — ”

“Hullo, Neville,” said Harry, feeling around in the dark

and pulling Neville up by his cloak.

“Harry? Is that you? What’s happening?”

“No idea — sit down — ”

There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville

had tried to sit on Crookshanks.

“I’m going to go and ask the driver what’s going on,”

came Hermione’s voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard

the door slide open again, and then a thud and two

loud squeals of pain.

“Who’s that?”

“Who’s that?”

“Ginny?”

“Hermione?”

“What are you doing?”

“I was looking for Ron — ”

“Come in and sit down — ”

“Not here!” said Harry hurriedly. “I’m here!”

“Ouch!” said Neville.

“Quiet!” said a hoarse voice suddenly.

 

Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last.

Harry could hear movements in his corner. None of

them spoke.

There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering

light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin

appeared to be holding a handful of flames. They

illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked

alert and wary.

“Stay where you are,” he said in the same hoarse

voice, and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of

fire held out in front of him.

But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could

reach it.

Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering

flames in Lupin’s hand, was a cloaked figure that

towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden

beneath its hood. Harry’s eyes darted downward, and

what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a

hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening,

grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something

dead that had decayed in water. . . .

But it was visible only for a split second. As though

the creature beneath the cloak sensed Harry’s gaze,

the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its

black cloak.

And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it

was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it

were trying to suck something more than air from its

surroundings.

An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his

own breath catch in his chest. The cold went deeper

 

than his skin. It was inside his chest, it was inside

his very heart. ...

Harry’s eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn’t see.

He was drowning in cold. There was a rushing in his

ears as though of water. He was being dragged

downward, the roaring growing louder . . .

And then, from far away, he heard screaming,

terrible, terrified, pleading screams. He wanted to

help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but

couldn’t ... a thick white fog was swirling around him,

inside him —

“Harry! Harry! Are you all right?”

Someone was slapping his face.

“W — what?”

Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above

him, and the floor was shaking — the Hogwarts

Express was moving again and the lights had come

back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto

the floor. Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to

him, and above them he could see Neville and

Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when

he put up his hand to push his glasses back on, he

felt cold sweat on his face.

Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.

“Are you okay?” Ron asked nervously.

“Yeah,” said Harry, looking quickly toward the door.

The hooded creature had vanished. “What happened?

Where’s that — that thing? Who screamed?”

“No one screamed,” said Ron, more nervously still.

 

Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny

and Neville looked back at him, both very pale.

“But I heard screaming — ”

A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was

breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.

“Here,” he said to Harry, handing him a particularly

large piece. “Eat it. It’ll help.”

Harry took the chocolate but didn’t eat it.

“What was that thing?” he asked Lupin.

“A dementor,” said Lupin, who was now giving

chocolate to everyone else. “One of the dementors of

Azkaban.”

Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up

the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket.

“Eat,” he repeated. “It’ll help. I need to speak to the

driver, excuse me ...”

He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the

corridor.

“Are you sure you’re okay, Harry?” said Hermione,

watching Harry anxiously.

“I don’t get it. ... What happened?” said Harry, wiping

more sweat off his face.

“Well — that thing — the dementor — stood there and

looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn’t see its

face) — and you — you — ”

 

“I thought you were having a fit or something,” said

Ron, who still looked scared. “You went sort of rigid

and fell out of your seat and started twitching — ”

“And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked

toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,” said

Hermione, “and he said, ‘None of us is hiding Sirius

Black under our cloaks. Go.’ But the dementor didn’t

move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery

thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around

and sort of glided away. ...”

“It was horrible,” said Neville, in a higher voice than

usual. “Did you feel how cold it got when it came in?”

“I felt weird,” said Ron, shifting his shoulders

uncomfortably. “Like I’d never be cheerful again. ...”

Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly

as bad as Harry felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went

over and put a comforting arm around her.

“But didn’t any of you — fall off your seats?” said

Harry awkwardly.

“No,” said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again.

“Ginny was shaking like mad, though. ...”

Harry didn’t understand. He felt weak and shivery, as

though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu; he

also felt the beginnings of shame. Why had he gone to

pieces like that, when no one else had?

Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he

entered, looked around, and said, with a small smile,

“I haven’t poisoned that chocolate, you know. ...”

 

Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt

warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and

toes.

“Well be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,” said Professor

Lupin. “Are you all right, Harry?”

Harry didn’t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.

“Fine,” he muttered, embarrassed.

They didn’t talk much during the remainder of the

journey. At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade

station, and there was a great scramble to get

outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville’s pet

toad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was

freezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down

in icy sheets.

“Firs’ years this way!” called a familiar voice. Harry,

Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic

outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform,

beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward

for their traditional journey across the lake.

“All righ’, you three?” Hagrid yelled over the heads of

the crowd. They waved at him, but had no chance to

speak to him because the mass of people around

them was shunting them away along the platform.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the

school along the platform and out onto a rough mud

track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited

the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only

assume, by an invisible horse, because when they

climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all

by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.

The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry

felt better since the chocolate, but still weak. Ron and

 

Hermione kept looking at him sideways, as though

frightened he might collapse again.

As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent

wrought iron gates, flanked with stone columns

topped with winged boars, Harry saw two more

towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on

either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to

engulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat

and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates.

The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping

drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of

the tiny window, watching the many turrets and

towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a

halt, and Hermione and Ron got out.

As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice

sounded in his ear.

“You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottom telling the truth?

You actually fainted?”

Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry’s way

up the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and

his pale eyes glinting maliciously.

“Shove off, Malfoy,” said Ron, whose jaw was

clenched.

“Did you faint as well, Weasley?” said Malfoy loudly.

“Did the scary old dementor frighten you too,

Weasley?”

“Is there a problem?” said a mild voice. Professor

Lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage.

Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which

took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated

suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, he

 

said, “Oh, no — er — Professor,” then he smirked at

Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the

castle.

Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him

hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd

swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front

doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit

with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent

marble staircase that led to the upper floors.

The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right;

Harry followed the crowd toward it, but had barely

glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and

cloudy tonight, when a voice called, “Potter! Granger!

I want to see you both!”

Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised.

Professor McGonagall, Transfiguration teacher and

head of Gryffindor House, was calling over the heads

of the crowd. She was a stern-looking witch who wore

her hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed

with square spectacles. Harry fought his way over to

her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall

had a way of making him feel he must have done

something wrong.

“There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a

word in my office,” she told them. “Move along there,

Weasley.”

Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered

Harry and Hermione away from the chattering crowd;

they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up

the marble staircase, and along a corridor.

Once they were in her office, a small room with a

large, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned

Harry and Hermione to sit down. She settled herself

 

behind her desk and said abruptly, “Professor Lupin

sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on

the train, Potter.”

Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on

the door and Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, came

bustling in.

Harry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad

enough that he’d passed out, or whatever he had

done, without everyone making all this fuss.

“I’m fine,” he said, “I don’t need anything — ”

“Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring

this and bending down to stare closely at him. “I

suppose you’ve been doing something dangerous

again?”

“It was a dementor, Poppy,” said Professor

McGonagall.

They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey

clucked disapprovingly.

“Setting dementors around a school,” she muttered,

pushing back Harry’s hair and feeling his forehead.

“He won’t be the last one who collapses. Yes, he’s all

clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they

have on people who are already delicate — ”

“I’m not delicate!” said Harry crossly.

“Of course you’re not,” said Madam Pomfrey

absentmindedly, now taking his pulse.

“What does he need?” said Professor McGonagall

crisply. “Bed rest? Should he perhaps spend tonight

in the hospital wing?”

 

‘Tm /ine!” said Harry, jumping up. The thought of

what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the

hospital wing was torture.

“Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very

least,” said Madam Pomfrey, who was now trying to

peer into Harry’s eyes.

“I’ve already had some,” said Harry. “Professor Lupin

gave me some. He gave it to all of us.”

“Did he, now?” said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. “So

we’ve finally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts

teacher who knows his remedies?”

“Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?” Professor

McGonagall said sharply.

“Yes,” said Harry.

“Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick

word with Miss Granger about her course schedule,

then we can go down to the feast together.”

Harry went back into the corridor with Madam

Pomfrey, who left for the hospital wing, muttering to

herself. He had to wait only a few minutes; then

Hermione emerged looking very happy about

something, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the

three of them made their way back down the marble

staircase to the Great Hall.

It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long

House tables was lined with students, their faces

glimmering by the light of thousands of candles,

which were floating over the tables in midair.

Professor Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a

shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and

a three-legged stool out of the hall.

 

“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the

Sorting!”

New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by

trying on the Sorting Hat, which shouted out the

House they were best suited to (Gryffindor,

Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor

McGonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the

staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the

other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the

Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as

they passed along the back of the hall, and a few of

them pointed at Harry. Had the story of his collapsing

in front of the dementor traveled that fast?

He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who

had saved them seats.

“What was all that about?” he muttered to Harry.

Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that

moment the headmaster stood up to speak, and he

broke off.

Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave

an impression of great energy. He had several feet of

long silver hair and beard, half-moon spectacles, and

an extremely crooked nose. He was often described as

the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn’t why

Harry respected him. You couldn’t help trusting Albus

Dumbledore, and as Harry watched him beaming

around at the students, he felt really calm for the first

time since the dementor had entered the train

compartment.

“Welcome!” said Dumbledore, the candlelight

shimmering on his beard. “Welcome to another year

at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you all, and

as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it

 

out of the way before you become befuddled by our

excellent feast. ...”

Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, “As

you will all be aware after their search of the

Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing

host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are

here on Ministry of Magic business.”

He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley

had said about Dumbledore not being happy with the

dementors guarding the school.

“They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,”

Dumbledore continued, “and while they are with us, I

must make it plain that nobody is to leave school

without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled

by tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility Cloaks,”

he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each

other. “It is not in the nature of a dementor to

understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn

each and every one of you to give them no reason to

harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head

Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul

of the dementors,” he said.

Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry,

puffed out his chest again and stared around

impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked

very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or

made a sound.

“On a happier note,” he continued, “I am pleased to

welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year.

“First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to

fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”

 

There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic

applause. Only those who had been in the

compartment on the train with Professor Lupin

clapped hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin

looked particularly shabby next to all the other

teachers in their best robes.

“Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear.

Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring

along the staff table at Professor Lupin. It was

common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense

Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated

Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his

thin, sallow face. It was beyond anger: it was loathing.

Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the

look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.

“As to our second new appointment,” Dumbledore

continued as the lukewarm applause for Professor

Lupin died away. “Well, I am sorry to tell you that

Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures

teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to

enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I

am delighted to say that his place will be filled by

none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to

take on this teaching job in addition to his

gamekeeping duties.”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another,

stunned. Then they joined in with the applause,

which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor table in

particular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who

was ruby-red in the face and staring down at his

enormous hands, his wide grin hidden in the tangle of

his black beard.

 

“We should’ve known!” Ron roared, pounding the

table. “Who else would have assigned us a biting

book?”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop

clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started

speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his

eyes on the tablecloth.

“Well, I think that’s everything of importance,” said

Dumbledore. “Let the feast begin!”

The golden plates and goblets before them filled

suddenly with food and drink. Harry, suddenly

ravenous, helped himself to everything he could reach

and began to eat.

It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk,

laughter, and the clatter of knives and forks. Harry,

Ron, and Hermione, however, were eager for it to

finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew

how much being made a teacher would mean to him.

Hagrid wasn’t a fully qualified wizard; he had been

expelled from Hogwarts in his third year for a crime

he had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and

Hermione who had cleared Hagrid ’s name last year.

At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart

had melted from the golden platters, Dumbledore

gave the word that it was time for them all to go to

bed, and they got their chance.

“Congratulations, Hagrid!” Hermione squealed as they

reached the teachers’ table.

“All down ter you three,” said Hagrid, wiping his

shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them.

“Can’ believe it ... great man, Dumbledore ... came

straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn

 

said he’d had enough. ... It’s what I always wanted.

Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his

napkin, and Professor McGonagall shooed them away.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors

streaming up the marble staircase and, very tired

now, along more corridors, up more and more stairs,

to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower. A large

portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them,

“Password?”

“Coming through, coming through!” Percy called from

behind the crowd. “The new password’s ‘Fortuna

Major’!”

“Oh no,” said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always

had trouble remembering the passwords.

Through the portrait hole and across the common

room, the girls and boys divided toward their separate

staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair with no

thought in his head except how glad he was to be

back. They reached their familiar, circular dormitory

with its five four-poster beds, and Harry, looking

around, felt he was home at last.

 

TALONS AND TEA LEAVES

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great

Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they

saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining

a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As

they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a

swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter.

“Ignore him,” said Hermione, who was right behind

Harry. “Just ignore him, it’s not worth it. ...”

“Hey, Potter!” shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin

girl with a face like a pug. “Potter! The dementors are

coming, Potter! Woooooooo!”

Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next

to George Weasley.

“New third-year course schedules,” said George,

passing them over. “What’s up with you, Harry?”

“Malfoy,” said Ron, sitting down on George’s other

side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.

 

George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to

faint with terror again.

“That little git,” he said calmly. “He wasn’t so cocky

last night when the dementors were down at our end

of the train. Came running into our compartment,

didn’t he, Fred?”

“Nearly wet himself,” said Fred, with a contemptuous

glance at Malfoy.

“I wasn’t too happy myself,” said George. “They’re

horrible things, those dementors. ...”

“Sort of freeze your insides, don’t they?” said Fred.

“You didn’t pass out, though, did you?” said Harry in

a low voice.

“Forget it, Harry,” said George bracingly. “Dad had to

go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he

said it was the worst place he’d ever been, he came

back all weak and shaking. . . . They suck the

happiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the

prisoners go mad in there.”

“Anyway, we’ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our

first Quidditch match,” said Fred. “Gryffindor versus

Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?”

The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other

in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off

worse. Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped

himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.

Hermione was examining her new schedule.

“Ooh, good, we’re starting some new subjects today,”

she said happily.

 

“Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he looked over her

shoulder, “they’ve messed up your schedule. Look —

they’ve got you down for about ten subjects a day.

There isn’t enough time.”

“I’ll manage. I’ve fixed it all with Professor

McGonagall.”

“But look,” said Ron, laughing, “see this morning?

Nine o’clock, Divination. And underneath, nine

o’clock, Muggle Studies. And” — Ron leaned closer to

the schedule, disbelieving — “ look — underneath

that, Arithmancy, nine o’clock. I mean, I know you’re

good, Hermione, but no one’s that good. How’re you

supposed to be in three classes at once?”

“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione shortly. “Of course I

won’t be in three classes at once.”

“Well, then — ”

“Pass the marmalade,” said Hermione.

“But — ”

“Oh, Ron, what’s it to you if my schedule’s a bit full?”

Hermione snapped. “I told you, I’ve fixed it all with

Professor McGonagall.”

Just then, Hagrid entered the Great Hall. He was

wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was

absentmindedly swinging a dead polecat from one

enormous hand.

“All righ’?” he said eagerly, pausing on the way to the

staff table. “Yer in my firs’ ever lesson! Right after

lunch! Bin up since five gettin’ everythin’ ready. ...

Hope it’s okay. ... Me, a teacher ... hones’ly. ...”

 

He grinned broadly at them and headed off to the

staff table, still swinging the polecat.

“Wonder what he’s been getting ready?” said Ron, a

note of anxiety in his voice.

The hall was starting to empty as people headed off

toward their first lesson. Ron checked his course

schedule.

“We’d better go, look, Divination’s at the top of North

Tower. It’ll take us ten minutes to get there. ...”

They finished their breakfasts hastily, said good-bye

to Fred and George, and walked back through the

hall. As they passed the Slytherin table, Malfoy did

yet another impression of a fainting fit. The shouts of

laughter followed Harry into the entrance hall.

The journey through the castle to North Tower was a

long one. Two years at Hogwarts hadn’t taught them

everything about the castle, and they had never been

inside North Tower before.

“There’s — got — to — be — a — shortcut,” Ron

panted as they climbed their seventh long staircase

and emerged on an unfamiliar landing, where there

was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of

grass hanging on the stone wall.

“I think it’s this way,” said Hermione, peering down

the empty passage to the right.

“Can’t be,” said Ron. “That’s south, look, you can see

a bit of the lake out of the window ...”

Harry was watching the painting. A fat, dapple-gray

pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing

nonchalantly. Harry was used to the subjects of

 

Hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their

frames to visit one another, but he always enjoyed

watching it. A moment later, a short, squat knight in

a suit of armor clanked into the picture after his

pony. By the look of the grass stains on his metal

knees, he had just fallen off.

“Aha!” he yelled, seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

“What villains are these, that trespass upon my

private lands! Come to scorn at my fall, perchance?

Draw, you knaves, you dogs!”

They watched in astonishment as the little knight

tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began

brandishing it violently, hopping up and down in

rage. But the sword was too long for him; a

particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he

landed facedown in the grass.

“Are you all right?” said Harry, moving closer to the

picture.

“Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!”

The knight seized his sword again and used it to push

himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the

grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he

couldn’t get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back

down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his

sweating face.

“Listen,” said Harry, taking advantage of the knight’s

exhaustion, “we’re looking for the North Tower. You

don’t know the way, do you?”

“A quest!” The knight’s rage seemed to vanish

instantly. He clanked to his feet and shouted, “Come

follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or

else shall perish bravely in the charge!”

 

He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and

failed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, “On

foot then, good sirs and gentle lady! On! On!”

And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the

frame and out of sight.

They hurried after him along the corridor, following

the sound of his armor. Every now and then they

spotted him running through a picture ahead.

“Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!” yelled the

knight, and they saw him reappear in front of an

alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture

hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.

Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the

tightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier,

until at last they heard the murmur of voices above

them and knew they had reached the classroom.

“Farewell!” cried the knight, popping his head into a

painting of some sinister-looking monks. “Farewell,

my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have need of noble

heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!”

“Yeah, well call you,” muttered Ron as the knight

disappeared, “if we ever need someone mental.”

They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a

tiny landing, where most of the class was already

assembled. There were no doors off this landing, but

Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where

there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on

it.

“ ‘Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,’ ” Harry read.

“How’re we supposed to get up there?”

 

As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor

suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended

right at Harry’s feet. Everyone got quiet.

“After you,” said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the

ladder first.

He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he

had ever seen. In fact, it didn’t look like a classroom

at all, more like a cross between someone’s attic and

an old-fashioned tea shop. At least twenty small,

circular tables were crammed inside it, all

surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs.

Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the

curtains at the windows were all closed, and the

many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It

was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning

under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a

heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large

copper kettle. The shelves running around the

circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking

feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered

playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a

huge array of teacups.

Ron appeared at Harry’s shoulder as the class

assembled around them, all talking in whispers.

“Where is she?” Ron said.

A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft,

misty sort of voice.

“Welcome,” it said. “How nice to see you in the

physical world at last.”

Harry’s immediate impression was of a large,

glittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into the

firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her

 

large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their

natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled

shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around

her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were

encrusted with bangles and rings.

“Sit, my children, sit,” she said, and they all climbed

awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry,

Ron, and Hermione sat themselves around the same

round table.

“Welcome to Divination,” said Professor Trelawney,

who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front

of the fire. “My name is Professor Trelawney. You may

not have seen me before. I find that descending too

often into the hustle and bustle of the main school

clouds my Inner Eye.”

Nobody said anything to this extraordinary

pronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately

rearranged her shawl and continued, “So you have

chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all

magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if

you do not have the Sight, there is very little I will be

able to teach you. Books can take you only so far in

this field. ...”

At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced,

grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the

news that books wouldn’t be much help in this

subject.

“Many witches and wizards, talented though they are

in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden

disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled

mysteries of the future,” Professor Trelawney went on,

her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to

nervous face. “It is a Gift granted to few. You, boy,”

 

she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off

his pouf. “Is your grandmother well?”

“I think so,” said Neville tremulously.

“I wouldn’t be so sure if I were you, dear,” said

Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long

emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney

continued placidly. “We will be covering the basic

methods of Divination this year. The first term will be

devoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall

progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,” she shot

suddenly at Parvati Patil, “beware a red-haired man.”

Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right

behind her, and edged her chair away from him.

“In the second term,” Professor Trelawney went on,

“we shall progress to the crystal ball — if we have

finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately,

classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout

of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter,

one of our number will leave us forever.”

A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but

Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it.

“I wonder, dear,” she said to Lavender Brown, who

was nearest and shrank back in her chair, “if you

could pass me the largest silver teapot?”

Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an

enormous teapot from the shelf, and put it down on

the table in front of Professor Trelawney.

“Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are

dreading — it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of

October.”

 

Lavender trembled.

“Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a

teacup from the shelf, come to me, and I will fill it.

Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs

remain. Swill these around the cup three times with

the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its

saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then

give your cup to your partner to read. You will

interpret the patterns using pages five and six of

Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping

and instructing. Oh, and dear” — she caught Neville

by the arm as he made to stand up — “after you’ve

broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to

select one of the blue patterned ones? I’m rather

attached to the pink.”

Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf

of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china.

Professor Trelawney swept over to him holding a

dustpan and brush and said, “One of the blue ones,

then, dear, if you wouldn’t mind ... thank you. ...”

When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled,

they went back to their table and tried to drink the

scalding tea quickly. They swilled the dregs around as

Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the

cups and swapped over.

“Right,” said Ron as they both opened their books at

pages five and six. “What can you see in mine?”

“A load of soggy brown stuff,” said Harry. The heavily

perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel

sleepy and stupid.

“Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes

to see past the mundane!” Professor Trelawney cried

through the gloom.

 

Harry tried to pull himself together.

“Right, you’ve got a crooked sort of cross ...” He

consulted Unfogging the Future. “That means you’re

going to have ‘trials and suffering’ — sorry about that

— but there’s a thing that could be the sun ... hang

on ... that means ‘great happiness’ ... so you’re going

to suffer but be very happy. ...”

“You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,” said

Ron, and they both had to stifle their laughs as

Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction.

“My turn ...” Ron peered into Harry’s teacup, his

forehead wrinkled with effort. “There’s a blob a bit like

a bowler hat,” he said. “Maybe you’re going to work

for the Ministry of Magic. ...”

He turned the teacup the other way up.

“But this way it looks more like an acorn. ... What’s

that?” He scanned his copy of Unfogging the Future. “

‘A windfall, unexpected gold.’ Excellent, you can lend

me some ... and there’s a thing here,” he turned the

cup again, “that looks like an animal . . . yeah, if that

was its head ... it looks like a hippo ... no, a sheep ...”

Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a

snort of laughter.

“Let me see that, my dear,” she said reprovingly to

Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry’s cup from

him. Everyone went quiet to watch.

Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup,

rotating it counterclockwise.

“The falcon ... my dear, you have a deadly enemy.”

 

“But everyone knows that,” said Hermione in a loud

whisper. Professor Trelawney stared at her.

“Well, they do,” said Hermione. “Everybody knows

about Harry and You-Know-Who.”

Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of

amazement and admiration. They had never heard

Hermione speak to a teacher like that before.

Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered

her huge eyes to Harry’s cup again and continued to

turn it.

“The club ... an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy

cup. ...”

“I thought that was a bowler hat,” said Ron

sheepishly.

“The skull ... danger in your path, my dear. ...”

Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor

Trelawney, who gave the cup a final turn, gasped, and

then screamed.

There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville

had smashed his second cup. Professor Trelawney

sank into a vacant armchair, her glittering hand at

her heart and her eyes closed.

“My dear boy . . . my poor, dear boy ... no ... it is

kinder not to say ... no ... don’t ask me. ...”

“What is it, Professor?” said Dean Thomas at once.

Everyone had got to their feet, and slowly they

crowded around Harry and Ron’s table, pressing close

to Professor Trelawney’s chair to get a good look at

Harry’s cup.

 

“My dear,” Professor Trelawney’s huge eyes opened

dramatically, “you have the Grim.”

“The what?” said Harry.

He could tell that he wasn’t the only one who didn’t

understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him and

Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody

else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.

“The Grim, my dear, the Grim!” cried Professor

Trelawney, who looked shocked that Harry hadn’t

understood. “The giant, spectral dog that haunts

churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen — the worst

omen — of death .!”

Harry’s stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of

Death Omens in Flourish and Blotts — the dog in the

shadows of Magnolia Crescent . . . Lavender Brown

clapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was

looking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had

gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor

Trelawney’s chair.

“I don’t think it looks like a Grim,” she said flatly.

Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with

mounting dislike.

“You’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I

perceive very little aura around you. Very little

receptivity to the resonances of the future.”

Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to

side.

“It looks like a Grim if you do this,” he said, with his

eyes almost shut, “but it looks more like a donkey

from here,” he said, leaning to the left.

 

“When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going

to die or not!” said Harry, taking even himself by

surprise. Now nobody seemed to want to look at him.

“I think we will leave the lesson here for today,” said

Professor Trelawney in her mistiest voice. “Yes ...

please pack away your things. ...”

Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor

Trelawney, packed away their books, and closed their

bags. Even Ron was avoiding Harry’s eyes.

“Until we meet again,” said Professor Trelawney

faintly, “fair fortune be yours. Oh, and dear” — she

pointed at Neville — “you’ll be late next time, so mind

you work extra-hard to catch up.”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor

Trelawney’s ladder and the winding stair in silence,

then set off for Professor McGonagall’s

Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find

her classroom that, early as they had left Divination,

they were only just in time.

Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room,

feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright

spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive

glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead

at any moment. He hardly heard what Professor

McGonagall was telling them about Animagi (wizards

who could transform at will into animals), and wasn’t

even watching when she transformed herself in front

of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings

around her eyes.

“Really, what has got into you all today?” said

Professor McGonagall, turning back into herself with

a faint pop, and staring around at them all. “Not that

 

it matters, but that’s the first time my

transformation’s not got applause from a class.”

Everybody’s heads turned toward Harry again, but

nobody spoke. Then Hermione raised her hand.

“Please, Professor, we’ve just had our first Divination

class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and — ”

“Ah, of course,” said Professor McGonagall, suddenly

frowning. “There is no need to say any more, Miss

Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this

year?”

Everyone stared at her.

“Me,” said Harry, finally.

“I see,” said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with

her beady eyes. “Then you should know, Potter, that

Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one

student a year since she arrived at this school. None

of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her

favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for

the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues — ”

Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her

nostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly,

“Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of

magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very

little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and

Professor Trelawney — ”

She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-

fact tone, “You look in excellent health to me, Potter,

so you will excuse me if I don’t let you off homework

today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand

it in.”

 

Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was

harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away

from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of

Professor Trelawney’s classroom. Not everyone was

convinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and

Lavender whispered, “But what about Neville’s cup?”

When the Transfiguration class had finished, they

joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for

lunch.

“Ron, cheer up,” said Hermione, pushing a dish of

stew toward him. “You heard what Professor

McGonagall said.”

Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his

fork but didn’t start.

“Harry,” he said, in a low, serious voice, “you haven’t

seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?”

“Yeah, I have,” said Harry. “I saw one the night I left

the Dursleys’.”

Ron let his fork fall with a clatter.

“Probably a stray,” said Hermione calmly.

Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone

mad.

“Hermione, if Harry’s seen a Grim, that’s — that’s

bad,” he said. “My — my uncle Bilius saw one and —

and he died twenty-four hours later!”

“Coincidence,” said Hermione airily, pouring herself

some pumpkin juice.

 

“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” said Ron,

starting to get angry. “Grims scare the living daylights

out of most wizards!”

“There you are, then,” said Hermione in a superior

tone. “They see the Grim and die of fright. The Grim’s

not an omen, it’s the cause of death! And Harry’s still

with us because he’s not stupid enough to see one

and think, right, well, I’d better kick the bucket then!”

Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened

her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and

propped it open against the juice jug.

“I think Divination seems very woolly,” she said,

searching for her page. “A lot of guesswork, if you ask

me.”

“There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that

cup!” said Ron hotly.

“You didn’t seem quite so confident when you were

telling Harry it was a sheep,” said Hermione coolly.

“Professor Trelawney said you didn’t have the right

aura! You just don’t like being bad at something for a

change!”

He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her

Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits

of meat and carrot flew everywhere.

“If being good at Divination means I have to pretend

to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I’m not

sure I’ll be studying it much longer! That lesson was

absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy

class!”

She snatched up her bag and stalked away.

 

Ron frowned after her.

“What’s she talking about?” he said to Harry. “She

hasn’t been to an Arithmancy class yet.”

Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch.

Yesterday’s rain had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale

gray, and the grass was springy and damp underfoot

as they set off for their first ever Care of Magical

Creatures class.

Ron and Hermione weren’t speaking to each other.

Harry walked beside them in silence as they went

down the sloping lawns to Hagrid’s hut on the edge of

the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted

three only-too-familiar backs ahead of them that he

realized they must be having these lessons with the

Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe

and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure

he knew what they were talking about.

Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut.

He stood in his moleskin overcoat, with Fang the

boarhound at his heels, looking impatient to start.

“C’mon, now, get a move on!” he called as the class

approached. “Got a real treat for yeh today! Great

lesson cornin’ up! Everyone here? Right, follow me!”

For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid

was going to lead them into the forest; Harry had had

enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a

lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge

of the trees, and five minutes later, they found

themselves outside a kind of paddock. There was

nothing in there.

 

“Everyone gather ’round the fence here!” he called.

“That’s it — make sure yeh can see — now, firs’ thing

yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books — ”

“How?” said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy.

“Eh?” said Hagrid.

“How do we open our books?” Malfoy repeated. He

took out his copy of The Monster Book of Monsters,

which he had bound shut with a length of rope. Other

people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had

belted their book shut; others had crammed them

inside tight bags or clamped them together with

binder clips.

“Hasn’ — hasn’ anyone bin able ter open their

books?” said Hagrid, looking crestfallen.

The class all shook their heads.

“Yeh’ve got ter stroke ’em,” said Hagrid, as though

this was the most obvious thing in the world. “Look —

He took Hermione’s copy and ripped off the Spellotape

that bound it. The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a

giant forefinger down its spine, and the book

shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.

“Oh, how silly we’ve all been!” Malfoy sneered. “We

should have stroked them! Why didn’t we guess!”

“I — I thought they were funny,” Hagrid said

uncertainly to Hermione.

“Oh, tremendously funny!” said Malfoy. “Really witty,

giving us books that try and rip our hands off!”

 

“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Hagrid was

looking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid ’s first

lesson to be a success.

“Righ’ then,” said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his

thread, “so — so yeh’ve got yer books an’ — an’ —

now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Yeah. So I’ll go

an’ get ’em. Hang on ...”

He strode away from them into the forest and out of

sight.

“God, this place is going to the dogs,” said Malfoy

loudly. “That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a

fit when I tell him — ”

“Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry repeated.

“Careful, Potter, there’s a dementor behind you — ”

“Oooooooh!” squealed Lavender Brown, pointing

toward the opposite side of the paddock.

Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre

creatures Harry had ever seen. They had the bodies,

hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs,

wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles,

with cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly

orange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a

foot long and deadly looking. Each of the beasts had a

thick leather collar around its neck, which was

attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these

were held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came

jogging into the paddock behind the creatures.

“Gee up, there!” he roared, shaking the chains and

urging the creatures toward the fence where the class

stood. Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached

them and tethered the creatures to the fence.

 

“Hippogriffs!” Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at

them. “Beau’iful, aren’ they?”

Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you

got over the first shock of seeing something that was

half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the

hippogriffs’ gleaming coats, changing smoothly from

feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy

gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and

inky black.

“So,” said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and

beaming around, “if yeh wan’ ter come a bit nearer — ”

No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione,

however, approached the fence cautiously.

“Now, firs’ thing yeh gotta know abou’ hippogriffs is,

they’re proud,” said Hagrid. “Easily offended,

hippogriffs are. Don’t never insult one, ’cause it might

be the last thing yeh do.”

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren’t listening; they

were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty

feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the

lesson.

“Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs’

move,” Hagrid continued. “It’s polite, see? Yeh walk

toward him, and yeh bow, an’ yeh wait. If he bows

back, yeh’re allowed ter touch him. If he doesn’ bow,

then get away from him sharpish, ’cause those talons

hurt.

“Right — who wants ter go first?”

Most of the class backed farther away in answer.

Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings. The

hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing

 

their powerful wings; they didn’t seem to like being

tethered like this.

“No one?” said Hagrid, with a pleading look.

“I’ll do it,” said Harry.

There was an intake of breath from behind him, and

both Lavender and Parvati whispered, “Oooh, no,

Harry, remember your tea leaves!”

Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock

fence.

“Good man, Harry!” roared Hagrid. “Right then — let’s

see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.”

He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff

away from its fellows, and slipped off its leather

collar. The class on the other side of the paddock

seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy’s eyes were

narrowed maliciously.

“Easy, now, Harry,” said Hagrid quietly. “Yeh’ve got

eye contact, now try not ter blink. ... Hippogriffs don’

trust yeh if yeh blink too much. ...”

Harry’s eyes immediately began to water, but he

didn’t shut them. Buckbeak had turned his great,

sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce

orange eye.

“Tha’s it,” said Hagrid. “Tha’s it, Harry ... now, bow

Harry didn’t feel much like exposing the back of his

neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. He gave

a short bow and then looked up.

 

The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It

didn’t move.

“Ah,” said Hagrid, sounding worried. “Right — back

away, now, Harry, easy does it — ”

But then, to Harry’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff

suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into

what was an unmistakable bow.

“Well done, Harry!” said Hagrid, ecstatic. “Right —

yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!”

Feeling that a better reward would have been to back

away, Harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and

reached out toward it. He patted the beak several

times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as

though enjoying it.

The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy,

Crabbe, and Goyle, who were looking deeply

disappointed.

“Righ’ then, Harry,” said Hagrid. “I reckon he might’

let yeh ride him!”

This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was

used to a broomstick; but he wasn’t sure a hippogriff

would be quite the same.

“Yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint,” said

Hagrid, “an’ mind yeh don’ pull any of his feathers

out, he won’ like that. ...”

Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeak’s wing and

hoisted himself onto its back. Buckbeak stood up.

Harry wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything in

front of him was covered with feathers.

 

“Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s

hindquarters.

Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on

either side of Harry; he just had time to seize the

hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring

upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry

knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff’s wings

beat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching

him under his legs and making him feel he was about

to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his

fingers and he didn’t dare get a stronger grip; instead

of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he

now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the

hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its

wings.

Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and

then headed back to the ground; this was the bit

Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the

smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off

over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-

assorted feet hit the ground. He just managed to hold

on and push himself straight again.

“Good work, Harry!” roared Hagrid as everyone except

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. “Okay, who else

wants a go?”

Emboldened by Harry’s success, the rest of the class

climbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied

the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were

bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran

repeatedly backward from his, which didn’t seem to

want to bend its knees. Ron and Hermione practiced

on the chestnut, while Harry watched.

 

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak.

He had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his

beak, looking disdainful.

“This is very easy,” Malfoy drawled, loud enough for

Harry to hear him. “I knew it must have been, if

Potter could do it. ... I bet you’re not dangerous at all,

are you?” he said to the hippogriff. “Are you, you great

ugly brute?”

It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a

high-pitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was

wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he

strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass,

blood blossoming over his robes.

“I’m dying!” Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. “I’m

dying, look at me! It’s killed me!”

“Yer not dyin’!” said Hagrid, who had gone very white.

“Someone help me — gotta get him outta here — ”

Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted

Malfoy easily. As they passed, Harry saw that there

was a long, deep gash on Malfoy’s arm; blood

splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the

slope toward the castle.

Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class

followed at a walk. The Slytherins were all shouting

about Hagrid.

“They should fire him straight away!” said Pansy

Parkinson, who was in tears.

“It was Malfoy’s fault!” snapped Dean Thomas.

Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly.

 

They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted

entrance hall.

“I’m going to see if he’s okay!” said Pansy, and they all

watched her run up the marble staircase. The

Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away

in the direction of their dungeon common room;

Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to

Gryffindor Tower.

“D’you think he’ll be all right?” said Hermione

nervously.

“ ’Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in

about a second,” said Harry, who had had far worse

injuries mended magically by the nurse.

“That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid ’s

first class, though, wasn’t it?” said Ron, looking

worried. “Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him. ...”

They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at

dinnertime, hoping to see Hagrid, but he wasn’t there.

“They wouldn’t fire him, would they?” said Hermione

anxiously, not touching her steak-and-kidney

pudding.

“They’d better not,” said Ron, who wasn’t eating

either.

Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group

including Crabbe and Goyle was huddled together,

deep in conversation. Harry was sure they were

cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been

injured.

“Well, you can’t say it wasn’t an interesting first day

back,” said Ron gloomily.

 

They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common

room after dinner and tried to do the homework

Professor McGonagall had given them, but all three of

them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower

window.

“There’s a light on in Hagrid’s window,” Harry said

suddenly.

Ron looked at his watch.

“If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It’s still

quite early. ...”

“I don’t know,” Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw

her glance at him.

“I’m allowed to walk across the grounds,” he said

pointedly. “Sirius Black hasn’t got past the dementors

yet, has he?”

So they put their things away and headed out of the

portrait hole, glad to meet nobody on their way to the

front doors, as they weren’t entirely sure they were

supposed to be out.

The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the

twilight. When they reached Hagrid’s hut, they

knocked, and a voice growled, “C’min.”

Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed

wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in

Hagrid’s lap. One look told them that Hagrid had been

drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as

big as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be

having difficulty getting them into focus.

 

“ ’Spect it’s a record,” he said thickly, when he

recognized them. “Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a

teacher who lasted on’y a day before.”

“You haven’t been fired, Hagrid!” gasped Hermione.

“Not yet,” said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp

of whatever was in the tankard. “But ’s only a matter

o’ time, i’n’t it, after Malfoy ...”

“How is he?” said Ron as they all sat down. “It wasn’t

serious, was it?”

“Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,” said

Hagrid dully, “but he’s sayin’ it’s still agony ... covered

in bandages ... moanin’ ...”

“He’s faking it,” said Harry at once. “Madam Pomfrey

can mend anything. She regrew half my bones last

year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it’s worth.”

“School gov’nors have bin told, o’ course,” said Hagrid

miserably. “They reckon I started too big. Shoulda left

hippogriffs fer later ... done flobberworms or summat.

... Jus’ thought it’d make a good firs’ lesson. ... ’S all

my fault. ...”

“It’s all Malfoy ’s fault, Hagrid!” said Hermione

earnestly.

“We’re witnesses,” said Harry. “You said hippogriffs

attack if you insult them. It’s Malfoy’s problem that

he wasn’t listening. We’ll tell Dumbledore what really

happened.”

“Yeah, don’t worry, Hagrid, we’ll back you up,” said

Ron.

 

Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid ’s

beetle-black eyes. He grabbed both Harry and Ron

and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.

“I think you’ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,” said

Hermione firmly. She took the tankard from the table

and went outside to empty it.

“Ar, maybe she’s right,” said Hagrid, letting go of

Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing

their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and

followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a

loud splash.

“What’s he done?” said Harry nervously as Hermione

came back in with the empty tankard.

“Stuck his head in the water barrel,” said Hermione,

putting the tankard away.

Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping

wet, wiping the water out of his eyes.

“Tha’s better,” he said, shaking his head like a dog

and drenching them all. “Listen, it was good of yeh ter

come an’ see me, I really — ”

Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he’d

only just realized he was there.

“WHAT DYEH THINK YOU’RE DOIN’, EH?” he roared,

so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air.

“YEH ’RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN’ AROUND AFTER

DARK, HARRY! AN’ YOU TWO! LETTIN’ HIM!”

Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and

pulled him to the door.

 

“C’mon!” Hagrid said angrily. “I’m takin’yer all back

up ter school, an’ don’ let me catch yeh walkin’ down

ter see me after dark again. I’m not worth that!”

THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE

Malfoy didn’t reappear in classes until late on

Thursday morning, when the Slytherins and

Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He

swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in

bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry’s

opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of

some dreadful battle.

“How is it, Draco?” simpered Pansy Parkinson. “Does

it hurt much?”

“Yeah,” said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of

grimace. But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and

Goyle when Pansy had looked away.

“Settle down, settle down,” said Professor Snape idly.

Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn’t

have said “settle down” if they’d walked in late, he’d

have given them detention. But Malfoy had always

been able to get away with anything in Snape ’s

 

classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and

generally favored his own students above all others.

They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking

Solution. Malfoy set up his cauldron right next to

Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing their

ingredients on the same table.

“Sir,” Malfoy called, “sir, I’ll need help cutting up

these daisy roots, because of my arm — ”

“Weasley, cut up Malfoy’s roots for him,” said Snape

without looking up.

Ron went brick red.

“There’s nothing wrong with your arm,” he hissed at

Malfoy.

Malfoy smirked across the table.

“Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these

roots.”

Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy’s roots toward

him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they

were all different sizes.

“Professor,” drawled Malfoy, “Weasley’s mutilating my

roots, sir.”

Snape approached their table, stared down his

hooked nose at the roots, then gave Ron an

unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black

hair.

“Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.”

“But, sir — !”

 

Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully

shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.

“Now,” said Snape in his most dangerous voice.

Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the

table at Malfoy, then took up the knife again.

“And, sir, 111 need this shrivelfig skinned,” said

Malfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter.

“Potter, you can skin Malfoy’s shrivelfig,” said Snape,

giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved

just for him.

Harry took Malfoy’s shrivelfig as Ron began trying to

repair the damage to the roots he now had to use.

Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and

flung it back across the table at Malfoy without

speaking. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than

ever.

“Seen your pal Hagrid lately?” he asked them quietly.

“None of your business,” said Ron jerkily, without

looking up.

“I’m afraid he won’t be a teacher much longer,” said

Malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow. “Father’s not very

happy about my injury — ”

“Keep talking, Malfoy, and I’ll give you a real injury,”

snarled Ron.

“ — he’s complained to the school governors. And to

the Ministry of Magic. Father’s got a lot of influence,

you know. And a lasting injury like this” — he gave a

huge, fake sigh — “who knows if my arm’ll ever be the

same again?”

 

“So that’s why you’re putting it on,” said Harry,

accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his

hand was shaking in anger. “To try to get Hagrid

fired.”

“Well,” said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper,

“ partly , Potter. But there are other benefits too.

Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.”

A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville

regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his

worst subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape

made things ten times worse. His potion, which was

supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned —

“Orange, Longbottom,” said Snape, ladling some up

and allowing it to splash back into the cauldron, so

that everyone could see. “Orange. Tell me, boy, does

anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn’t

you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one rat

spleen was needed? Didn’t I state plainly that a dash

of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to

make you understand, Longbottom?”

Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though

he was on the verge of tears.

“Please, sir,” said Hermione, “please, I could help

Neville put it right — ”

“I don’t remember asking you to show off, Miss

Granger,” said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as

pink as Neville. “Longbottom, at the end of this lesson

we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad

and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage

you to do it properly.”

Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with

fear.

 

“Help me!” he moaned to Hermione.

“Hey, Harry,” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to

borrow Harry’s brass scales, “have you heard? Daily

Prophet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black’s

been sighted.”

“Where?” said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other

side of the table, Malfoy looked up, listening closely.

“Not too far from here,” said Seamus, who looked

excited. “It was a Muggle who saw him. ’Course, she

didn’t really understand. The Muggles think he’s just

an ordinary criminal, don’t they? So she phoned the

telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic

got there, he was gone.”

“Not too far from here ... ,” Ron repeated, looking

significantly at Harry. He turned around and saw

Malfoy watching closely. “What, Malfoy? Need

something else skinned?”

But Malfoy’s eyes were shining malevolently, and they

were fixed on Harry. He leaned across the table.

“Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed,

Potter?”

“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry offhandedly.

Malfoy’s thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.

“Of course, if it was me,” he said quietly, “I’d have

done something before now. I wouldn’t be staying in

school like a good boy, I’d be out there looking for

him.”

“What are you talking about, Malfoy?” said Ron

roughly.

 

“Don’t you know, Potter?” breathed Malfoy, his pale

eyes narrowed.

“Know what?”

Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.

“Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck,” he said.

“Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it

was me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down myself.”

“ What are you talking about?” said Harry angrily, but

at that moment Snape called, “You should have

finished adding your ingredients by now; this potion

needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away

while it simmers and then we’ll test Longbottom’s. ...”

Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville

sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly. Hermione

was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of

her mouth, so that Snape wouldn’t see. Harry and

Ron packed away their unused ingredients and went

to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in

the corner.

“What did Malfoy mean?” Harry muttered to Ron as

he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from

the gargoyle’s mouth. “Why would I want revenge on

Black? He hasn’t done anything to me — yet.”

“He’s making it up,” said Ron savagely. “He’s trying to

make you do something stupid. ...”

The end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to

Neville, who was cowering by his cauldron.

“Everyone gather ’round,” said Snape, his black eyes

glittering, “and watch what happens to Longbottom’s

toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking

 

Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don’t

doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be

poisoned.”

The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins

looked excited. Snape picked up Trevor the toad in

his left hand and dipped a small spoon into Neville’s

potion, which was now green. He trickled a few drops

down Trevor’s throat.

There was a moment of hushed silence, in which

Trevor gulped; then there was a small pop, and Trevor

the tadpole was wriggling in Snape ’s palm.

The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking

sour, pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his

robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor, and he

reappeared suddenly, fully grown.

“Five points from Gryffindor,” said Snape, which

wiped the smiles from every face. “I told you not to

help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the

entrance hall. Harry was still thinking about what

Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething about

Snape.

“Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was

all right! Why didn’t you lie, Hermione? You should’ve

said Neville did it all by himself!”

Hermione didn’t answer. Ron looked around.

“Where is she?”

Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps

now, watching the rest of the class pass them,

heading for the Great Hall and lunch.

 

“She was right behind us,” said Ron, frowning.

Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and

Goyle. He smirked at Harry and disappeared.

“There she is,” said Harry.

Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the

stairs; one hand clutched her bag, the other seemed

to be tucking something down the front of her robes.

“How did you do that?” said Ron.

“What?” said Hermione, joining them.

“One minute you were right behind us, the next

moment, you were back at the bottom of the stairs

again.”

“What?” Hermione looked slightly confused. “Oh — I

had to go back for something. Oh no — ”

A seam had split on Hermione’s bag. Harry wasn’t

surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at

least a dozen large and heavy books.

“Why are you carrying all these around with you?”

Ron asked her.

“You know how many subjects I’m taking,” said

Hermione breathlessly. “Couldn’t hold these for me,

could you?”

“But — ” Ron was turning over the books she had

handed him, looking at the covers. “You haven’t got

any of these subjects today. It’s only Defense Against

the Dark Arts this afternoon.”

 

“Oh yes,” said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all

the books back into her bag just the same. “I hope

there’s something good for lunch, I’m starving,” she

added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.

“D’you get the feeling Hermione ’s not telling us

something?” Ron asked Harry.

Professor Lupin wasn’t there when they arrived at his

first Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all

sat down, took out their books, quills, and

parchment, and were talking when he finally entered

the room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty

old briefcase on the teacher’s desk. He was as shabby

as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train,

as though he had had a few square meals.

“Good afternoon,” he said. “Would you please put all

your books back in your bags. Today’s will be a

practical lesson. You will need only your wands.”

A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put

away their books. They had never had a practical

Defense Against the Dark Arts before, unless you

counted the memorable class last year when their old

teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and

set them loose.

“Right then,” said Professor Lupin, when everyone

was ready. “If you’d follow me.”

Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and

followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom. He led

them along the deserted corridor and around a

corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the

Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair

and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum.

 

Peeves didn’t look up until Professor Lupin was two

feet away; then he wiggled his curly-toed feet and

broke into song.

“Loony, loopy Lupin,” Peeves sang. “Loony, loopy

Lupin, loony, loopy Lupin — ”

Rude and unmanageable as he almost always was,

Peeves usually showed some respect toward the

teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin

to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he

was still smiling.

“I’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you,

Peeves,” he said pleasantly. “Mr. Filch won’t be able to

get in to his brooms.”

Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered,

failed wizard who waged a constant war against the

students and, indeed, Peeves. However, Peeves paid

no attention to Professor Lupin’s words, except to

blow a loud wet raspberry.

Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his

wand.

“This is a useful little spell,” he told the class over his

shoulder. “Please watch closely.”

He raised the wand to shoulder height, said,

“ Waddiwasil ” and pointed it at Peeves.

With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum

shot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeves ’s left

nostril; he whirled upright and zoomed away, cursing.

“Cool, sir!” said Dean Thomas in amazement.

 

“Thank you, Dean,” said Professor Lupin, putting his

wand away again. “Shall we proceed?”

They set off again, the class looking at shabby

Professor Lupin with increased respect. He led them

down a second corridor and stopped, right outside the

staffroom door.

“Inside, please,” said Professor Lupin, opening it and

standing back.

The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old,

mismatched chairs, was empty except for one teacher.

Professor Snape was sitting in a low armchair, and he

looked around as the class filed in. His eyes were

glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around

his mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to

close the door behind him, Snape said, “Leave it open,

Lupin. Td rather not witness this.”

He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black

robes billowing behind him. At the doorway he turned

on his heel and said, “Possibly no one’s warned you,

Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I

would advise you not to entrust him with anything

difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing

instructions in his ear.”

Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad

enough that he bullied Neville in his own classes, let

alone doing it in front of other teachers.

Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.

“I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the

first stage of the operation,” he said, “and I am sure

he will perform it admirably.”

 

Neville’s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape’s

lip curled, but he left, shutting the door with a snap.

“Now, then,” said Professor Lupin, beckoning the

class toward the end of the room, where there was

nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept

their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand

next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble,

banging off the wall.

“Nothing to worry about,” said Professor Lupin calmly

because a few people had jumped backward in alarm.

“There’s a boggart in there.”

Most people seemed to feel that this was something to

worry about. Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of

pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now

rattling doorknob apprehensively.

“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor

Lupin. “Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the

cupboards under sinks — I’ve even met one that had

lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in

yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if

the staff would leave it to give my third years some

practice.

“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what

is a boggart?”

Hermione put up her hand.

“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape

of whatever it thinks will frighten us most.”

“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor

Lupin, and Hermione glowed. “So the boggart sitting

in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form.

He does not yet know what will frighten the person on

 

the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a

boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let

him out, he will immediately become whatever each of

us most fears.

“This means,” said Professor Lupin, choosing to

ignore Neville’s small sputter of terror, “that we have a

huge advantage over the boggart before we begin.

Have you spotted it, Harry?”

Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to

him, bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet

with her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but

Harry had a go.

“Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know

what shape it should be?”

“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put

her hand down, looking a little disappointed. “It’s

always best to have company when you’re dealing

with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should

he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I

once saw a boggart make that very mistake — tried to

frighten two people at once and turned himself into

half a slug. Not remotely frightening.

“The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it

requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really

finishes a boggart is laughter. What you need to do is

force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.

“We will practice the charm without wands first. After

me, please ... riddikulusV’

“ RiddikulusV’ said the class together.

“Good,” said Professor Lupin. “Very good. But that

was the easy part, I’m afraid. You see, the word alone

 

is not enough. And this is where you come in,

Neville.”

The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as

Neville, who walked forward as though he were

heading for the gallows.

“Right, Neville,” said Professor Lupin. “First things

first: what would you say is the thing that frightens

you most in the world?”

Neville’s lips moved, but no noise came out.

“Didn’t catch that, Neville, sorry,” said Professor

Lupin cheerfully.

Neville looked around rather wildly, as though

begging someone to help him, then said, in barely

more than a whisper, “Professor Snape.”

Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned

apologetically. Professor Lupin, however, looked

thoughtful.

“Professor Snape ... hmmm ... Neville, I believe you

live with your grandmother?”

“Er — yes,” said Neville nervously. “But — I don’t

want the boggart to turn into her either.”

“No, no, you misunderstand me,” said Professor

Lupin, now smiling. “I wonder, could you tell us what

sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?”

Neville looked startled, but said, “Well ... always the

same hat. A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top.

And a long dress ... green, normally ... and sometimes

a fox-fur scarf.”

 

“And a handbag?” prompted Professor Lupin.

“A big red one,” said Neville.

“Right then,” said Professor Lupin. “Can you picture

those clothes very clearly, Neville? Can you see them

in your mind’s eye?”

“Yes,” said Neville uncertainly, plainly wondering

what was coming next.

“When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe,

Neville, and sees you, it will assume the form of

Professor Snape,” said Lupin. “And you will raise your

wand — thus — and cry ‘Riddikulus’ — and

concentrate hard on your grandmother’s clothes. If all

goes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into

that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with

that big red handbag.”

There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe

wobbled more violently.

“If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift

his attention to each of us in turn,” said Professor

Lupin. “I would like all of you to take a moment now

to think of the thing that scares you most, and

imagine how you might force it to look comical. ...”

The room went quiet. Harry thought ... What scared

him most in the world?

His first thought was Lord Voldemort — a Voldemort

returned to full strength. But before he had even

started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart -

Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to the

surface of his mind. ...

 

A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a

black cloak ... a long, rattling breath from an unseen

mouth . . . then a cold so penetrating it felt like

drowning. ...

Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one

had noticed. Many people had their eyes shut tight.

Ron was muttering to himself, “Take its legs off.”

Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron’s

greatest fear was spiders.

“Everyone ready?” said Professor Lupin.

Harry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn’t ready. How could

you make a dementor less frightening? But he didn’t

want to ask for more time; everyone else was nodding

and rolling up their sleeves.

“Neville, we’re going to back away,” said Professor

Lupin. “Let you have a clear field, all right? I’ll call the

next person forward. ... Everyone back, now, so

Neville can get a clear shot — ”

They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving

Neville alone beside the wardrobe. He looked pale and

frightened, but he had pushed up the sleeves of his

robes and was holding his wand ready.

“On the count of three, Neville,” said Professor Lupin,

who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the

wardrobe. “One — two — three — now\”

A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin’s

wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst

open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape

stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.

 

Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing

wordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him,

reaching inside his robes.

“R — r — riddikulusV’ squeaked Neville.

There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled;

he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a

towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and

he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.

There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused,

confused, and Professor Lupin shouted, “Parvati!

Forward!”

Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded

on her. There was another crack, and where he had

stood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its

sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to

walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff

arms rising —

“RiddikulusV’ cried Parvati.

A bandage unraveled at the mummy’s feet; it became

entangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off.

“Seamus!” roared Professor Lupin.

Seamus darted past Parvati.

Crack ! Where the mummy had been was a woman

with floor-length black hair and a skeletal, green-

tinged face — a banshee. She opened her mouth wide

and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long,

wailing shriek that made the hair on Harry’s head

stand on end —

“RiddikulusV’ shouted Seamus.

 

The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her

throat; her voice was gone.

Crack). The banshee turned into a rat, which chased

its tail in a circle, then — crack). — became a

rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before —

crack ! — becoming a single, bloody eyeball.

“It’s confused!” shouted Lupin. “We’re getting there!

Dean!”

Dean hurried forward.

Crack) The eyeball became a severed hand, which

flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a

crab.

“RiddikulusV’ yelled Dean.

There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a

mousetrap.

“Excellent! Ron, you next!”

Ron leapt forward.

Crack)

Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet

tall and covered in hair, was advancing on Ron,

clicking its pincers menacingly. For a moment, Harry

thought Ron had frozen. Then —

“RiddikulusV’ bellowed Ron, and the spider’s legs

vanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender Brown

squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt

at Harry’s feet. He raised his wand, ready, but —

 

“Here!” shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying

forward.

Crack).

The legless spider had vanished. For a second,

everyone looked wildly around to see where it was.

Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air

in front of Lupin, who said, “RiddikulusV’ almost

lazily.

Crack !

“Forward, Neville, and finish him off!” said Lupin as

the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach. Crack).

Snape was back. This time Neville charged forward

looking determined.

“RiddikulusV’ he shouted, and they had a split

second’s view of Snape in his lacy dress before Neville

let out a great “Ha!” of laughter, and the boggart

exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke,

and was gone.

“Excellent!” cried Professor Lupin as the class broke

into applause. “Excellent, Neville. Well done,

everyone. ... Let me see ... five points to Gryffindor for

every person to tackle the boggart — ten for Neville

because he did it twice . . . and five each to Hermione

and Harry.”

“But I didn’t do anything,” said Harry.

“You and Hermione answered my questions correctly

at the start of the class, Harry,” Lupin said lightly.

“Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. Homework,

kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it

for me ... to be handed in on Monday. That will be

all.”

 

Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry,

however, wasn’t feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had

deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart.

Why? Was it because he’d seen Harry collapse on the

train, and thought he wasn’t up to much? Had he

thought Harry would pass out again?

But no one else seemed to have noticed anything.

“Did you see me take that banshee?” shouted

Seamus.

“And the hand!” said Dean, waving his own around.

“And Snape in that hat!”

“And my mummy!”

“I wonder why Professor Lupin’s frightened of crystal

balls?” said Lavender thoughtfully.

“That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts

lesson we’ve ever had, wasn’t it?” said Ron excitedly

as they made their way back to the classroom to get

their bags.

“He seems like a very good teacher,” said Hermione

approvingly. “But I wish I could have had a turn with

the boggart — ”

“What would it have been for you?” said Ron,

sniggering. “A piece of homework that only got nine

out of ten?”

 

d

FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY

In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had

become most people’s favorite class. Only Draco

Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to

say about Professor Lupin.

“Look at the state of his robes,” Malfoy would say in a

loud whisper as Professor Lupin passed. “He dresses

like our old house-elf.”

But no one else cared that Professor Lupin’s robes

were patched and frayed. His next few lessons were

just as interesting as the first. After boggarts, they

studied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures

that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in

the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted

battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten

lost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy

water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with

webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in

their ponds.

Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his

other classes. Worst of all was Potions. Snape was in

 

a particularly vindictive mood these days, and no one

was in any doubt why. The story of the boggart

assuming Snape’s shape, and the way that Neville

had dressed it in his grandmother’s clothes, had

traveled through the school like wildfire. Snape didn’t

seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at

the very mention of Professor Lupin’s name, and he

was bullying Neville worse than ever.

Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent

in Professor Trelawney’s stifling tower room,

deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols, trying to

ignore the way Professor Trelawney’s enormous eyes

filled with tears every time she looked at him. He

couldn’t like Professor Trelawney, even though she

was treated with respect bordering on reverence by

many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown

had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney’s tower

room at lunchtimes, and always returned with

annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though

they knew things the others didn’t. They had also

started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to

Harry, as though he were on his deathbed.

Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which,

after the action-packed first class, had become

extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to have lost his

confidence. They were now spending lesson after

lesson learning how to look after flobberworms, which

had to be some of the most boring creatures in

existence.

“Why would anyone bother looking after them?” said

Ron, after yet another hour of poking shredded

lettuce down the flobberworms’ slimy throats.

At the start of October, however, Harry had

something else to occupy him, something so enjoyable

it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes.

 

The Quidditch season was approaching, and Oliver

Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor team, called a

meeting one Thursday evening to discuss tactics for

the new season.

There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three

Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by putting

the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball) through one of

the fifty-foot-high hoops at each end of the field; two

Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel

the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed

around trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who

defended the goal posts, and the Seeker, who had the

hardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch,

a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture

ended the game and earned the Seeker’s team an

extra one hundred and fifty points.

Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in

his seventh and final year at Hogwarts. There was a

quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed

his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms

on the edge of the darkening Quidditch field.

“This is our last chance — my last chance — to win

the Quidditch Cup,” he told them, striding up and

down in front of them. “I’ll be leaving at the end of

this year. I’ll never get another shot at it.

“Gryffindor hasn’t won for seven years now. Okay, so

we’ve had the worst luck in the world — injuries —

then the tournament getting called off last year. ...”

Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought

a lump to his throat. “But we also know we’ve got the

best — ruddy — team — in — the — school,” he said,

punching a fist into his other hand, the old manic

glint back in his eye.

“We’ve got three superb Chasers.”

 

Wood pointed at Alicia Spinnet, Angelina Johnson,

and Katie Bell.

“We’ve got two unbeatable Beaters.”

“Stop it, Oliver, you’re embarrassing us,” said Fred

and George Weasley together, pretending to blush.

“And we’ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win

us a match).” Wood rumbled, glaring at Harry with a

kind of furious pride. “And me,” he added as an

afterthought.

“We think you’re very good too, Oliver,” said George.

“Spanking good Keeper,” said Fred.

“The point is,” Wood went on, resuming his pacing,

“the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it

these last two years. Ever since Harry joined the

team, I’ve thought the thing was in the bag. But we

haven’t got it, and this year’s the last chance we’ll get

to finally see our name on the thing. ...”

Wood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George

looked sympathetic.

“Oliver, this year’s our year,” said Fred.

“Well do it, Oliver!” said Angelina.

“Definitely,” said Harry.

Full of determination, the team started training

sessions, three evenings a week. The weather was

getting colder and wetter, the nights darker, but no

amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry’s

wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver

Quidditch Cup.

 

Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one

evening after training, cold and stiff but pleased with

the way practice had gone, to find the room buzzing

excitedly.

“What’s happened?” he asked Ron and Hermione,

who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the

fireside and completing some star charts for

Astronomy.

“First Hogsmeade weekend,” said Ron, pointing at a

notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin

board. “End of October. Halloween.”

“Excellent,” said Fred, who had followed Harry

through the portrait hole. “I need to visit Zonko’s. I’m

nearly out of Stink Pellets.”

Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high

spirits ebbing away. Hermione seemed to read his

mind.

“Harry, I’m sure you’ll be able to go next time,” she

said. “They’re bound to catch Black soon. He’s been

sighted once already”

“Black’s not fool enough to try anything in

Hogsmeade,” said Ron. “Ask McGonagall if you can go

this time, Harry. The next one might not be for ages

“Ron\” said Hermione. “Harry’s supposed to stay in

school — ”

“He can’t be the only third year left behind,” said Ron.

“Ask McGonagall, go on, Harry — ”

“Yeah, I think I will,” said Harry, making up his mind.

 

Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that

moment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap. A

large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.

“Does he have to eat that in front of us?” said Ron,

scowling.

“Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by

yourself?” said Hermione.

Crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow

eyes fixed insolently on Ron.

“Just keep him over there, that’s all,” said Ron

irritably, turning back to his star chart. “I’ve got

Scabbers asleep in my bag.”

Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he

still had his own star chart to complete. He pulled his

bag toward him, took out parchment, ink, and quill,

and started work.

“You can copy mine, if you like,” said Ron, labeling

his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart

toward Harry.

Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her

lips but didn’t say anything. Crookshanks was still

staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking the end of his

bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced.

“OY!” Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks

sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began

tearing ferociously. “GET OFF, YOU STUPID ANIMAL!”

Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but

Crookshanks clung on, spitting and slashing.

 

“Ron, don’t hurt him!” squealed Hermione; the whole

common room was watching; Ron whirled the bag

around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers

came flying out of the top —

“CATCH THAT CAT!” Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed

himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the

table, and chased after the terrified Scabbers.

George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but

missed; Scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of

legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers.

Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his

bandy legs, and started making furious swipes

beneath it with his front paw.

Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed

Crookshanks around the middle and heaved him

away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, with

great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.

“Look at him!” he said furiously to Hermione,

dangling Scabbers in front of her. “He’s skin and

bone! You keep that cat away from him!”

“Crookshanks doesn’t understand it’s wrong!” said

Hermione, her voice shaking. “All cats chase rats,

Ron!”

“There’s something funny about that animal!” said

Ron, who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling

Scabbers back into his pocket. “It heard me say that

Scabbers was in my bag!”

“Oh, what rubbish,” said Hermione impatiently.

“Crookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else d’you

think — ”

 

“That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said Ron, ignoring

the people around him, who were starting to giggle.

“And Scabbers was here first, and he’s ill!”

Ron marched through the common room and out of

sight up the stairs to the boys’ dormitories.

Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day.

He barely talked to her all through Herbology, even

though he, Harry, and Hermione were working

together on the same puffapod.

“How’s Scabbers?” Hermione asked timidly as they

stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied

the shining beans into a wooden pail.

“He’s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking,” said

Ron angrily, missing the pail and scattering beans

over the greenhouse floor.

“Careful, Weasley, careful!” cried Professor Sprout as

the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes.

They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had

resolved to ask Professor McGonagall after the lesson

whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the rest,

joined the line outside the class trying to decide how

he was going to argue his case. He was distracted,

however, by a disturbance at the front of the line.

Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her

arm around her and was explaining something to

Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were

looking very serious.

“What’s the matter, Lavender?” said Hermione

anxiously as she, Harry, and Ron went to join the

group.

 

“She got a letter from home this morning,” Parvati

whispered. “It’s her rabbit, Binky. He’s been killed by

a fox.”

“Oh,” said Hermione, “I’m sorry, Lavender.”

“I should have known!” said Lavender tragically. “You

know what day it is?”

“Er — ”

“The sixteenth of October! That thing you’re dreading,

it will happen on the sixteenth of October!’

Remember? She was right, she was right!”

The whole class was gathered around Lavender now.

Seamus shook his head seriously. Hermione

hesitated; then she said, “You — you were dreading

Binky being killed by a fox?”

“Well, not necessarily by a fox,” said Lavender,

looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes, “but I

was obviously dreading him dying, wasn’t I?”

“Oh,” said Hermione. She paused again. Then —

“Was Binky an old rabbit?”

“N — no!” sobbed Lavender. “H — he was only a

baby!”

Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender’s

shoulders.

“But then, why would you dread him dying?” said

Hermione.

Parvati glared at her.

 

“Well, look at it logically,” said Hermione, turning to

the rest of the group. “I mean, Binky didn’t even die

today, did he? Lavender just got the news today — ”

Lavender wailed loudly. “ — and she can’t have been

dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock — ”

“Don’t mind Hermione, Lavender,” said Ron loudly,

“she doesn’t think other people’s pets matter very

much.”

Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at

that moment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione

and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and

when they got into class, they seated themselves on

either side of Harry and didn’t talk to each other for

the whole class.

Harry still hadn’t decided what he was going to say to

Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of

the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject

of Hogsmeade first.

“One moment, please!” she called as the class made

to leave. “As you’re all in my House, you should hand

Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween.

No form, no visiting the village, so don’t forget!”

Neville put up his hand.

“Please, Professor, I — I think I’ve lost — ”

“Your grandmother sent yours to me directly,

Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “She

seemed to think it was safer. Well, that’s all, you may

leave.”

“Ask her now,” Ron hissed at Harry.

“Oh, but — ” Hermione began.

 

“Go for it, Harry,” said Ron stubbornly.

Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear,

then headed nervously for Professor McGonagall’s

desk.

“Yes, Potter?”

Harry took a deep breath.

“Professor, my aunt and uncle — er — forgot to sign

my form,” he said.

Professor McGonagall looked over her square

spectacles at him but didn’t say anything.

“So — er — d’you think it would be all right — I

mean, will it be okay if I — if I go to Hogsmeade?”

Professor McGonagall looked down and began

shuffling papers on her desk.

“I’m afraid not, Potter,” she said. “You heard what I

said. No form, no visiting the village. That’s the rule.”

“But — Professor, my aunt and uncle — you know,

they’re Muggles, they don’t really understand about

— about Hogwarts forms and stuff,” Harry said, while

Ron egged him on with vigorous nods. “If you said I

could go — ”

“But I don’t say so,” said Professor McGonagall,

standing up and piling her papers neatly into a

drawer. “The form clearly states that the parent or

guardian must give permission.” She turned to look at

him, with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity?

“I’m sorry, Potter, but that’s my final word. You had

better hurry, or you’ll be late for your next lesson.”

 

There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor

McGonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed

Hermione; Hermione assumed an “all-for-the-best”

expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry

had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly

and happily about what they were going to do first,

once they got into Hogsmeade.

“There’s always the feast,” said Ron, in an effort to

cheer Harry up. “You know, the Halloween feast, in

the evening.”

“Yeah,” said Harry gloomily, “great.”

The Halloween feast was always good, but it would

taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in

Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing anyone said

made him feel any better about being left behind.

Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered

to forge Uncle Vernon’s signature on the form, but as

Harry had already told Professor McGonagall he

hadn’t had it signed, that was no good. Ron

halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but

Hermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what

Dumbledore had told them about the dementors

being able to see through them. Percy had what were

possibly the least helpful words of comfort.

“They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure

you, Harry, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be,” he said

seriously. “All right, the sweetshop’s rather good, and

Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dangerous, and yes, the

Shrieking Shack’s always worth a visit, but really,

Harry, apart from that, you’re not missing anything.”

On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest

and went down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly

depressed, though doing his best to act normally.

 

“Well bring you lots of sweets back from

Honeydukes,” said Hermione, looking desperately

sorry for him.

“Yeah, loads,” said Ron. He and Hermione had finally

forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the

face of Harry’s difficulties.

“Don’t worry about me,” said Harry, in what he hoped

was an offhand voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a

good time.”

He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where

Filch, the caretaker, was standing inside the front

doors, checking off names against a long list, peering

suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no

one was sneaking out who shouldn’t be going.

“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was

standing in line with Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of

passing the dementors?”

Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the

marble staircase, through the deserted corridors, and

back to Gryffindor Tower.

“Password?” said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.

“Fortuna Major,” said Harry listlessly.

The portrait swung open and he climbed through the

hole into the common room. It was full of chattering

first and second years, and a few older students, who

had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty

had worn off.

“Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!”

 

It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in

awe of Harry and never missed an opportunity to

speak to him.

“Aren’t you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not?

Hey” — Colin looked eagerly around at his friends —

“you can come and sit with us, if you like, Harry!”

“Er — no, thanks, Colin,” said Harry, who wasn’t in

the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the

scar on his forehead. “I — I’ve got to go to the library,

got to get some work done.”

After that, he had no choice but to turn right around

and head back out of the portrait hole again.

“What was the point waking me up?” the Fat Lady

called grumpily after him as he walked away.

Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but

halfway there he changed his mind; he didn’t feel like

working. He turned around and came face-to-face

with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of

the Hogsmeade visitors.

“What are you doing?” Filch snarled suspiciously.

“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully.

“Nothing!” spat Filch, his jowls quivering

unpleasantly. “A likely story! Sneaking around on

your own — why aren’t you in Hogsmeade buying

Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms

like the rest of your nasty little friends?”

Harry shrugged.

 

“Well, get back to your common room where you

belong!” snapped Filch, and he stood glaring until

Harry had passed out of sight.

But Harry didn’t go back to the common room; he

climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the

Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another

corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms

said, “Harry?”

Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met

Professor Lupin, looking around his office door.

“What are you doing?” said Lupin, though in a very

different voice from Filch. “Where are Ron and

Hermione?”

“Hogsmeade,” said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.

“Ah,” said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment.

“Why don’t you come in? I’ve just taken delivery of a

grindylow for our next lesson.”

“A what?” said Harry.

He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a

very large tank of water. A sickly green creature with

sharp little horns had its face pressed against the

glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly

fingers.

“Water demon,” said Lupin, surveying the grindylow

thoughtfully. “We shouldn’t have much difficulty with

him, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his

grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong,

but very brittle.”

The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried

itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner.

 

“Cup of tea?” Lupin said, looking around for his

kettle. “I was just thinking of making one.”

“All right,” said Harry awkwardly.

Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of

steam issued suddenly from the spout.

“Sit down,” said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin.

“I’ve only got teabags, I’m afraid — but I daresay

you’ve had enough of tea leaves?”

Harry looked at him. Lupin’s eyes were twinkling.

“How did you know about that?” Harry asked.

“Professor McGonagall told me,” said Lupin, passing

Harry a chipped mug of tea. “You’re not worried, are

you?”

“No,” said Harry.

He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the

dog he’d seen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not

to. He didn’t want Lupin to think he was a coward,

especially since Lupin already seemed to think he

couldn’t cope with a boggart.

Something of Harry’s thoughts seemed to have shown

on his face, because Lupin said, “Anything worrying

you, Harry?”

“No,” Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched

the grindylow brandishing a fist at him. “Yes,” he said

suddenly, putting his tea down on Lupin’s desk. “You

know that day we fought the boggart?

“Yes,” said Lupin slowly.

 

“Why didn’t you let me fight it?” said Harry abruptly.

Lupin raised his eyebrows.

“I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,” he

said, sounding surprised.

Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he’d

done any such thing, was taken aback.

“Why?” he said again.

“Well,” said Lupin, frowning slightly, “I assumed that

if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of

Lord Voldemort.”

Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he’d

expected, but Lupin had said Voldemort ’s name. The

only person Harry had ever heard say the name aloud

(apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.

“Clearly, I was wrong,” said Lupin, still frowning at

Harry. “But I didn’t think it a good idea for Lord

Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom. I imagined

that people would panic.”

“I didn’t think of Voldemort,” said Harry honestly. “I

— I remembered those dementors.”

“I see,” said Lupin thoughtfully. “Well, well ... I’m

impressed.” He smiled slightly at the look of surprise

on Harry’s face. “That suggests that what you fear

most of all is — fear. Very wise, Harry.”

Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he drank

some more tea.

“So you’ve been thinking that I didn’t believe you

capable of fighting the boggart?” said Lupin shrewdly.

 

“Well ... yeah,” said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a

lot happier. “Professor Lupin, you know the

dementors — ”

He was interrupted by a knock on the door.

“Come in,” called Lupin.

The door opened, and in came Snape. He was

carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and

stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes

narrowing.

“Ah, Severus,” said Lupin, smiling. “Thanks very

much. Could you leave it here on the desk for me?”

Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes

wandering between Harry and Lupin.

“I was just showing Harry my grindylow,” said Lupin

pleasantly, pointing at the tank.

“Fascinating,” said Snape, without looking at it. “You

should drink that directly, Lupin.”

“Yes, yes, I will,” said Lupin.

“I made an entire cauldronful,” Snape continued. “If

you need more.”

“I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks

very much, Severus.”

“Not at all,” said Snape, but there was a look in his

eye Harry didn’t like. He backed out of the room,

unsmiling and watchful.

Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled.

 

“Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion

for me,” he said. “I have never been much of a potion-

brewer and this one is particularly complex.” He

picked up the goblet and sniffed it. “Pity sugar makes

it useless,” he added, taking a sip and shuddering.

“Why — ?” Harry began. Lupin looked at him and

answered the unfinished question.

“I’ve been feeling a bit off-color,” he said. “This potion

is the only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be

working alongside Professor Snape; there aren’t many

wizards who are up to making it.”

Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a

crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands.

“Professor Snape’s very interested in the Dark Arts,”

he blurted out.

“Really?” said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as

he took another gulp of potion.

“Some people reckon — ” Harry hesitated, then

plunged recklessly on, “some people reckon he’d do

anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts

job.”

Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.

“Disgusting,” he said. “Well, Harry, I’d better get back

to work. I’ll see you at the feast later.”

“Right,” said Harry, putting down his empty teacup.

The empty goblet was still smoking.

“There you go,” said Ron. “We got as much as we

could carry.”

 

A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry’s

lap. It was dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just

turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the

cold wind and looking as though they’d had the time

of their lives.

“Thanks,” said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny

black Pepper Imps. “What’s Hogsmeade like? Where

did you go?”

By the sound of it — everywhere. Dervish and

Banges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko’s Joke

Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of

hot butterbeer, and many places besides.

“The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all

sitting on shelves, all color-coded depending on how

fast you want your letter to get there!”

“Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were

giving out free samples, there’s a bit, look — ”

“We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts

at the Three Broomsticks — ”

“Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer,

really warms you up — ”

“What did you do?” said Hermione, looking anxious.

“Did you get any work done?”

“No,” said Harry. “Lupin made me a cup of tea in his

office. And then Snape came in. ...”

He told them all about the goblet. Ron’s mouth fell

open.

“ Lupin drank it?” he gasped. “Is he mad?”

 

Hermione checked her watch.

“We’d better go down, you know, the feast’ll be

starting in five minutes. ...” They hurried through the

portrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing

Snape.

“But if he — you know” — Hermione dropped her

voice, glancing nervously around — “if he was trying

to — to poison Lupin — he wouldn’t have done it in

front of Harry.”

“Yeah, maybe,” said Harry as they reached the

entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall. It had

been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of

candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats,

and many flaming orange streamers, which were

swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant

watersnakes.

The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who

were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets,

managed second helpings of everything. Harry kept

glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin looked

cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking

animatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the

Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the

table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining

it, or were Snape ’s eyes flickering toward Lupin more

often than was natural?

The feast finished with an entertainment provided by

the Hogwarts ghosts. They popped out of the walls

and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly

Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great

success with a reenactment of his own botched

beheading.

 

It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry’s good

mood couldn’t even be spoiled by Malfoy, who

shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall,

“The dementors send their love, Potter!”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the

Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower,

but when they reached the corridor that ended with

the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed

with students.

“Why isn’t anyone going in?” said Ron curiously.

Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The

portrait seemed to be closed.

“Let me through, please,” came Percy’s voice, and he

came bustling importantly through the crowd.

“What’s the holdup here? You can’t all have forgotten

the password — excuse me, I’m Head Boy — ”

And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front

first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the

corridor. They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp

voice, “Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.”

People’s heads turned; those at the back were

standing on tiptoe.

“What’s going on?” said Ginny, who had just arrived.

A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there,

sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors

squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron,

and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble

was.

“Oh, my — ” Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm.

 

The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which

had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas

littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn

away completely.

Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined

painting and turned, his eyes somber, to see

Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying

toward him.

“We need to find her,” said Dumbledore. “Professor

McGonagall, please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell

him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat

Lady.”

“You’ll be lucky!” said a cackling voice.

It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd

and looking delighted, as he always did, at the sight

of wreckage or worry.

“What do you mean, Peeves?” said Dumbledore

calmly, and Peeves’s grin faded a little. He didn’t dare

taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an oily voice

that was no better than his cackle.

“Ashamed, Your Headship, sir. Doesn’t want to be

seen. She’s a horrible mess. Saw her running through

the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging

between the trees. Crying something dreadful,” he

said happily. “Poor thing,” he added unconvincingly.

“Did she say who did it?” said Dumbledore quietly.

“Oh yes, Professorhead,” said Peeves, with the air of

one cradling a large bombshell in his arms. “He got

very angry when she wouldn’t let him in, you see.”

Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from

 

between his own legs. “Nasty temper he’s got, that

Sirius Black.”

GRIM DEFEAT

Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to

the Great Hall, where they were joined ten minutes

later by the students from Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and

Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused.

“The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough

search of the castle,” Professor Dumbledore told them

as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick closed all

doors into the hall. “I’m afraid that, for your own

safety, you will have to spend the night here. I want

the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the

hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in

charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me

immediately,” he added to Percy, who was looking

immensely proud and important. “Send word with one

of the ghosts.”

Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall,

and said, “Oh, yes, you’ll be needing ...”

One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew

to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against

 

the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered

with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.

“Sleep well,” said Professor Dumbledore, closing the

door behind him.

The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the

Gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what

had just happened.

“Everyone into their sleeping bags!” shouted Percy.

“Come on, now, no more talking! Lights out in ten

minutes!”

“C’mon,” Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized

three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner.

“Do you think Black’s still in the castle?” Hermione

whispered anxiously.

“Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,” said Ron.

“It’s very lucky he picked tonight, you know,” said

Hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their

sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows

to talk. “The one night we weren’t in the tower. ...”

“I reckon he’s lost track of time, being on the run,”

said Ron. “Didn’t realize it was Halloween. Otherwise

he’d have come bursting in here.”

Hermione shuddered.

All around them, people were asking one another the

same question: “How did he get in?”

“Maybe he knows how to Apparate,” said a Ravenclaw

a few feet away. “Just appear out of thin air, you

know.”

 

“Disguised himself, probably,” said a Hufflepuff fifth

year.

“He could’ve flown in,” suggested Dean Thomas.

“Honestly, am I the only person who’s ever bothered

to read Hogwarts, A History?” said Hermione crossly

to Harry and Ron.

“Probably,” said Ron. “Why?”

“Because the castle’s protected by more than walls,

you know,” said Hermione. “There are all sorts of

enchantments on it, to stop people entering by

stealth. You can’t just Apparate in here. And I’d like

to see the disguise that could fool those dementors.

They’re guarding every single entrance to the

grounds. They’d have seen him fly in too. And Filch

knows all the secret passages, they’ll have them

covered. ...”

“The lights are going out now!” Percy shouted. “I want

everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking!”

The candles all went out at once. The only light now

came from the silvery ghosts, who were drifting about

talking seriously to the prefects, and the enchanted

ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was scattered

with stars. What with that, and the whispering that

still filled the hall, Harry felt as though he were

sleeping outdoors in a light wind.

Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall

to check that everything was quiet. Around three in

the morning, when many students had finally fallen

asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched

him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling

between the sleeping bags, telling people off for

talking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry,

 

Ron, and Hermione, who quickly pretended to be

asleep as Dumbledore’s footsteps drew nearer.

“Any sign of him, Professor?” asked Percy in a

whisper.

“No. All well here?”

“Everything under control, sir.”

“Good. There’s no point moving them all now. I’ve

found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor

portrait hole. You’ll be able to move them back in

tomorrow.”

“And the Fat Lady, sir?”

“Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor.

Apparently she refused to let Black in without the

password, so he attacked. She’s still very distressed,

but once she’s calmed down, I’ll have Mr. Filch

restore her.”

Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again,

and more footsteps.

“Headmaster?” It was Snape. Harry kept quite still,

listening hard. “The whole of the third floor has been

searched. He’s not there. And Filch has done the

dungeons; nothing there either.”

“What about the Astronomy tower? Professor

Trelawney’s room? The Owlery?”

“All searched ...”

“Very well, Severus. I didn’t really expect Black to

linger.”

 

“Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?”

asked Snape.

Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free

his other ear.

“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the

next.”

Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to

where they stood; Dumbledore ’s back was to him, but

he could see Percy’s face, rapt with attention, and

Snape ’s profile, which looked angry.

“You remember the conversation we had,

Headmaster, just before — ah — the start of term?”

said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as

though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.

“I do, Severus,” said Dumbledore, and there was

something like warning in his voice.

“It seems — almost impossible — that Black could

have entered the school without inside help. I did

express my concerns when you appointed — ”

“I do not believe a single person inside this castle

would have helped Black enter it,” said Dumbledore,

and his tone made it so clear that the subject was

closed that Snape didn’t reply. “I must go down to the

dementors,” said Dumbledore. “I said I would inform

them when our search was complete.”

“Didn’t they want to help, sir?” said Percy.

“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore coldly. “But I’m afraid no

dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I

am headmaster.”

 

Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the

hall, walking quickly and quietly. Snape stood for a

moment, watching the headmaster with an expression

of deep resentment on his face; then he too left.

Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of

them had their eyes open too, reflecting the starry

ceiling.

“What was all that about?” Ron mouthed.

The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the

next few days. The theories about how he had entered

the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott,

from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology

class telling anyone who’d listen that Black could

turn into a flowering shrub.

The Fat Lady’s ripped canvas had been taken off the

wall and replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan

and his fat gray pony. Nobody was very happy about

this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging

people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously

complicated passwords, which he changed at least

twice a day.

“He’s a complete lunatic,” said Seamus Finnigan

angrily to Percy. “Can’t we get anyone else?”

“None of the other pictures wanted the job,” said

Percy. “Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady.

Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to

volunteer.”

Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry’s

worries. He was now being closely watched. Teachers

found excuses to walk along corridors with him, and

Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his

mother’s orders) was tailing him everywhere like an

 

extremely pompous guard dog. To cap it all, Professor

McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with

such a somber expression on her face Harry thought

someone must have died.

“There’s no point hiding it from you any longer,

Potter,” she said in a very serious voice. “I know this

will come as a shock to you, but Sirius Black — ”

“I know he’s after me,” said Harry wearily. “I heard

Ron’s dad telling his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the

Ministry of Magic.”

Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She

stared at Harry for a moment or two, then said, “I see!

Well, in that case, Potter, you’ll understand why I

don’t think it’s a good idea for you to be practicing

Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only

your team members, it’s very exposed, Potter — ”

“We’ve got our first match on Saturday!” said Harry,

outraged. “I’ve got to train, Professor!”

Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry

knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor

team’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d

suggested him as Seeker in the first place. He waited,

holding his breath.

“Hmm ...” Professor McGonagall stood up and stared

out of the window at the Quidditch field, just visible

through the rain. “Well ... goodness knows, I’d like to

see us win the Cup at last ... but all the same, Potter

... I’d be happier if a teacher were present. I’ll ask

Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions.”

The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch

match drew nearer. Undaunted, the Gryffindor team

was training harder than ever under the eye of

 

Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session

before Saturday’s match, Oliver Wood gave his team

some unwelcome news.

“We’re not playing Slytherin!” he told them, looking

very angry. “Flint’s just been to see me. We’re playing

Hufflepuff instead.”

“Why?” chorused the rest of the team.

“Flint’s excuse is that their Seeker’s arm’s still

injured,” said Wood, grinding his teeth furiously. “But

it’s obvious why they’re doing it. Don’t want to play in

this weather. Think it’ll damage their chances. ...”

There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day,

and as Wood spoke, they heard a distant rumble of

thunder.

“There’s nothing wrong with Malfoy’s arm!” said Harry

furiously. “He’s faking it!”

“I know that, but we can’t prove it,” said Wood

bitterly. “And we’ve been practicing all those moves

assuming we’re playing Slytherin, and instead it’s

Hufflepuff, and their style’s quite different. They’ve got

a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory — ”

Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.

“What?” said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted

behavior.

“He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he?” said

Angelina.

“Strong and silent,” said Katie, and they started to

giggle again.

 

“He’s only silent because he’s too thick to string two

words together,” said Fred impatiently. “I don’t know

why you’re worried, Oliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover.

Last time we played them, Harry caught the Snitch in

about five minutes, remember?”

“We were playing in completely different conditions!”

Wood shouted, his eyes bulging slightly. “Diggory’s

put a very strong side together! He’s an excellent

Seeker! I was afraid you’d take it like this! We mustn’t

relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to

wrong-foot us! We must win!”

“Oliver, calm down!” said Fred, looking slightly

alarmed. “We’re taking Hufflepuff very seriously.

Seriously.”

The day before the match, the winds reached howling

point and the rain fell harder than ever. It was so

dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra

torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team was

looking very smug indeed, and none more so than

Malfoy.

“Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!” he sighed

as the gale outside pounded the windows.

Harry had no room in his head to worry about

anything except the match tomorrow. Oliver Wood

kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving

him tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked

for so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten

minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and

set off at a run with Wood shouting after him,

“Diggory’s got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might

want to try looping him — ”

 

Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against

the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and

dashed inside.

“Sorry I’m late, Professor Lupin, I — ”

But it wasn’t Professor Lupin who looked up at him

from the teacher’s desk; it was Snape.

“This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think

we’ll make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down.”

But Harry didn’t move.

“Where’s Professor Lupin?” he said.

“He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,” said

Snape with a twisted smile. “I believe I told you to sit

down?”

But Harry stayed where he was.

“What’s wrong with him?”

Snape ’s black eyes glittered.

“Nothing life-threatening,” he said, looking as though

he wished it were. “Five more points from Gryffindor,

and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be

fifty.”

Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape

looked around at the class.

“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor

Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have

covered so far — ”

 

“Please, sir, we’ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas,

and grindylows,” said Hermione quickly, “and we’re

just about to start — ”

“Be quiet,” said Snape coldly. “I did not ask for

information. I was merely commenting on Professor

Lupin’s lack of organization.”

“He’s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher

we’ve ever had,” said Dean Thomas boldly, and there

was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the

class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.

“You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing

you — I would expect first years to be able to deal

with Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall

discuss — ”

Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the

very back chapter, which he must know they hadn’t

covered.

“ — werewolves,” said Snape.

“But, sir,” said Hermione, seemingly unable to

restrain herself, “we’re not supposed to do werewolves

yet, we’re due to start hinkypunks — ”

“Miss Granger,” said Snape in a voice of deadly calm,

“I was under the impression that I am teaching this

lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to

page 394.” He glanced around again. “All of you!

Now\”

With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen

muttering, the class opened their books.

“Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between

the werewolf and the true wolf?” said Snape.

 

Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except

Hermione, whose hand, as it so often did, had shot

straight into the air.

“Anyone?” Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted

smile was back. “Are you telling me that Professor

Lupin hasn’t even taught you the basic distinction

between — ”

“We told you,” said Parvati suddenly, “we haven’t got

as far as werewolves yet, we’re still on — ”

“Silencel” snarled Snape. “Well, well, well, I never

thought I’d meet a third -year class who wouldn’t even

recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make

a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very

behind you all are. ...”

“Please, sir,” said Hermione, whose hand was still in

the air, “the werewolf differs from the true wolf in

several small ways. The snout of the werewolf — ”

“That is the second time you have spoken out of turn,

Miss Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five more points

from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.”

Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and

stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a

mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they

were all glaring at him, because every one of them

had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and

Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least

twice a week, said loudly, “You asked us a question

and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don’t want

to be told?”

The class knew instantly he’d gone too far. Snape

advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its

breath.

 

“Detention, Weasley,” Snape said silkily, his face very

close to Ron’s. “And if I ever hear you criticize the way

I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.”

No one made a sound throughout the rest of the

lesson. They sat and made notes on werewolves from

the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the

rows of desks, examining the work they had been

doing with Professor Lupin.

“Very poorly explained . . . That is incorrect, the kappa

is more commonly found in Mongolia. . . . Professor

Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn’t have given

it three. ...”

When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.

“You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me,

on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want

two rolls of parchment on the subject, and I want

them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took

this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to

arrange your detention.”

Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the

class, who waited until they were well out of earshot,

then burst into a furious tirade about Snape.

“Snape ’s never been like this with any of our other

Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did

want the job,” Harry said to Hermione. “Why’s he got

it in for Lupin? D’you think this is all because of the

boggart?”

“I don’t know,” said Hermione pensively. “But I really

hope Professor Lupin gets better soon. ...”

Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a

towering rage.

 

“D’you know what that — ” (he called Snape

something that made Hermione say “Ron\”) “ — is

making me do? I’ve got to scrub out the bedpans in

the hospital wing. Without magid” He was breathing

deeply, his fists clenched. “Why couldn’t Black have

hidden in Snape’s office, eh? He could have finished

him off for us!”

Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early

that it was still dark. For a moment he thought the

roaring of the wind had woken him. Then he felt a

cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt

upright — Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating

next to him, blowing hard in his ear.

“What did you do that for?” said Harry furiously.

Peeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed

backward out of the room, cackling.

Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It

was half past four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and

tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now

that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of the

thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind

against the castle walls, and the distant creaking of

the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he

would be out on the Quidditch field, battling through

that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more

sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two

Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory.

As Harry opened the door, something brushed against

his leg. He bent down just in time to grab

Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag

him outside.

“You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,” Harry

told Crookshanks suspiciously. “There are plenty of

 

mice around this place — go and chase them. Go on,”

he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral

staircase with his foot. “Leave Scabbers alone.”

The noise of the storm was even louder in the

common room. Harry knew better than to think the

match would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren’t

called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless,

he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had

pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor;

Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry.

Seekers were usually light and speedy, but Diggory’s

weight would be an advantage in this weather

because he was less likely to be blown off course.

Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of

the fire, getting up every now and then to stop

Crookshanks from sneaking up the boys’ staircase

again. At long last Harry thought it must be time for

breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole

alone.

“Stand and fight, you mangy cur!” yelled Sir Cadogan.

“Oh, shut up,” Harry yawned.

He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by

the time he’d started on toast, the rest of the team

had turned up.

“It’s going to be a tough one,” said Wood, who wasn’t

eating anything.

“Stop worrying, Oliver,” said Alicia soothingly, “we

don’t mind a bit of rain.”

But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such

was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school

turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran

 

down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads

bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being

whipped out of their hands as they went. Just before

he entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy,

Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from

under an enormous umbrella on their way to the

stadium.

The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited

for Wood’s usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn’t

come. He tried to speak several times, made an odd

gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and

beckoned them to follow him.

The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways

as they walked out onto the field. If the crowd was

cheering, they couldn’t hear it over the fresh rolls of

thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry’s glasses.

How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?

The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite

side of the field, wearing canary -yellow robes. The

Captains walked up to each other and shook hands;

Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood now looked as

though he had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw

Madam Hooch’s mouth form the words, “Mount your

brooms.” He pulled his right foot out of the mud with

a squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two

Thousand. Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips

and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant —

they were off.

Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly

with the wind. He held it as steady as he could and

turned, squinting into the rain.

Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and

frozen, hardly able to see his teammates, let alone the

tiny Snitch. He flew backward and forward across the

 

field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no idea

of what was happening in the rest of the game. He

couldn’t hear the commentary over the wind. The

crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and

battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to

being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so

clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadn’t seen

them coming.

He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder

to hold his broom straight. The sky was getting

darker, as though night had decided to come early.

Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without

knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent;

everyone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, he

could hardly tell them apart. ...

With the first flash of lightning came the sound of

Madam Hooch’s whistle; Harry could just see the

outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him

to the ground. The whole team splashed down into

the mud.

“I called for time-out!” Wood roared at his team.

“Come on, under here — ”

They huddled at the edge of the field under a large

umbrella; Harry took off his glasses and wiped them

hurriedly on his robes.

“What’s the score?”

“We’re fifty points up,” said Wood, “but unless we get

the Snitch soon, we’ll be playing into the night.”

“I’ve got no chance with these on,” Harry said

exasperatedly, waving his glasses.

 

At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his

shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head

and was, inexplicably, beaming.

“I’ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!”

He handed them to her, and as the team watched in

amazement, Hermione tapped them with her wand

and said, “Imperviusl”

“There!” she said, handing them back to Harry.

“They’ll repel water!”

Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.

“Brilliant!” he called hoarsely after her as she

disappeared into the crowd. “Okay, team, let’s go for

it!”

Hermione ’s spell had done the trick. Harry was still

numb with cold, still wetter than he’d ever been in his

life, but he could see. Full of fresh determination, he

urged his broom through the turbulent air, staring in

every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger,

ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the

opposite direction. ...

There was another clap of thunder, followed

immediately by forked lightning. This was getting

more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the

Snitch quickly —

He turned, intending to head back toward the middle

of the field, but at that moment, another flash of

lightning illuminated the stands, and Harry saw

something that distracted him completely — the

silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly

imprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost,

empty row of seats.

 

Harry’s numb hands slipped on the broom handle

and his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking his

sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back into

the stands. The dog had vanished.

“Harry!” came Wood’s anguished yell from the

Gryffindor goal posts. “Harry, behind you!”

Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was

pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was

shimmering in the rain-filled air between them —

With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the

broom-handle and zoomed toward the Snitch.

“Come on!” he growled at his Nimbus as the rain

whipped his face. “Fasteri”

But something odd was happening. An eerie silence

was falling across the stadium. The wind, though as

strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It was as

though someone had turned off the sound, as though

Harry had gone suddenly deaf — what was going on?

And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over

him, inside him, just as he became aware of

something moving on the field below. . . .

Before he’d had time to think, Harry had taken his

eyes off the Snitch and looked down.

At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces

pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It

was as though freezing water were rising in his chest,

cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again. ...

Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head

... a woman . . .

“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry\”

 

“ Stand aside, you silly girl ... stand aside, now. ...”

“ Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead — ”

Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry’s

brain. . . . What was he doing? Why was he flying? He

needed to help her. ... She was going to die. ... She

was going to be murdered. ...

He was falling, falling through the icy mist.

“Not Harry\ Please ... have mercy ... have mercy. ...”

A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was

screaming, and Harry knew no more.

“Lucky the ground was so soft.”

“I thought he was dead for sure.”

“But he didn’t even break his glasses.”

Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they

made no sense whatsoever. He didn’t have a clue

where he was, or how he’d got there, or what he’d

been doing before he got there. All he knew was that

every inch of him was aching as though it had been

beaten.

“That was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”

Scariest . . . the scariest thing . . . hooded black figures

... cold ... screaming ...

Harry’s eyes snapped open. He was lying in the

hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team,

spattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered

around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there,

 

looking as though they’d just climbed out of a

swimming pool.

“Harry!” said Fred, who looked extremely white

underneath the mud. “How’re you feeling?”

It was as though Harry’s memory was on fast forward.

The lightning — the Grim — the Snitch — and the

dementors ...

“What happened?” he said, sitting up so suddenly

they all gasped.

“You fell off,” said Fred. “Must’ve been — what — fifty

feet?”

“We thought you’d died,” said Alicia, who was

shaking.

Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were

extremely bloodshot.

“But the match,” said Harry. “What happened? Are we

doing a replay?”

No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into

Harry like a stone.

“We didn’t — lose?”

“Diggory got the Snitch,” said George. “Just after you

fell. He didn’t realize what had happened. When he

looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to

call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and

square ... even Wood admits it.”

“Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he

wasn’t there.

 

“Still in the showers,” said Fred. “We think he’s trying

to drown himself.”

Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping

his hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it

roughly.

“C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch

before.”

“There had to be one time you didn’t get it,” said

George.

“It’s not over yet,” said Fred. “We lost by a hundred

points, right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and

we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin ...”

“Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred

points,” said George.

“But if they beat Ravenclaw ...”

“No way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses

against Hufflepuff ...”

“It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred

either way — ”

Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost ...

for the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.

After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to

tell the team to leave him in peace.

“Well come and see you later,” Fred told him. “Don’t

beat yourself up, Harry, you’re still the best Seeker

we’ve ever had.”

 

The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them.

Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking

disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to

Harry’s bed.

“Dumbledore was really angry,” Hermione said in a

quaking voice. “I’ve never seen him like that before.

He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wand, and

you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground.

Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot

silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away.

... He was furious they’d come onto the grounds. We

heard him — ”

“Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,” said Ron.

“And walked up to school with you floating on it.

Everyone thought you were ...”

His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was

thinking about what the dementors had done to him

... about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw

Ron and Hermione looking at him so anxiously that

he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to

say.

“Did someone get my Nimbus?”

Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.

“Er — ”

“What?” said Harry, looking from one to the other.

“Well ... when you fell off, it got blown away,” said

Hermione hesitantly.

“And?”

 

“And it hit — it hit — oh, Harry — it hit the

Whomping Willow.”

Harry’s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a

very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the

grounds.

“And?” he said, dreading the answer.

“Well, you know the Whomping Willow,” said Ron. “It

— it doesn’t like being hit.”

“Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you

came around,” said Hermione in a very small voice.

Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned

it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered

wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of

Harry’s faithful, finally beaten broomstick.

THE MARAUDER’S MAP

Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the

hospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He didn’t

argue or complain, but he wouldn’t let her throw

away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two

Thousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that

the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn’t

help it; he felt as though he’d lost one of his best

friends.

He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him

up. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that

looked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley,

blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she

had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry

kept it shut under his bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor

team visited again on Sunday morning, this time

accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow,

dead sort of voice) that he didn’t blame him in the

slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry’s bedside only

at night. But nothing anyone said or did could make

Harry feel any better, because they knew only half of

what was troubling him.

 

He hadn’t told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron

and Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic

and Hermione would scoff. The fact remained,

however, that it had now appeared twice, and both

appearances had been followed by near-fatal

accidents; the first time, he had nearly been run over

by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from

his broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him

until he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest

of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast?

And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick

and humiliated every time he thought of them.

Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but no

one else collapsed every time they went near one. No

one else heard echoes in their head of their dying

parents.

Because Harry knew who that screaming voice

belonged to now. He had heard her words, heard

them over and over again during the night hours in

the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the

strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the

dementors approached him, he heard the last

moments of his mother’s life, her attempts to protect

him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort’s

laughter before he murdered her. . . . Harry dozed

fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted

hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell

again on his mother’s voice.

It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the

main school on Monday, where he was forced to think

about other things, even if he had to endure Draco

Malfoy’s taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself

with glee at Gryffindor’s defeat. He had finally taken

off his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of

both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry

falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their next

 

Potions class doing dementor imitations across the

dungeon; Ron finally cracked and flung a large,

slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in

the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from

Gryffindor.

“If Snape’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts

again, I’m skiving off,” said Ron as they headed

toward Lupin’s classroom after lunch. “Check who’s

in there, Hermione.”

Hermione peered around the classroom door.

“It’s okay!”

Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked

as though he had been ill. His old robes were hanging

more loosely on him and there were dark shadows

beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class

as they took their seats, and they burst at once into

an explosion of complaints about Snape’s behavior

while Lupin had been ill.

“It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give

us homework?”

“We don’t know anything about werewolves — ”

“ — two rolls of parchment!”

“Did you tell Professor Snape we haven’t covered them

yet?” Lupin asked, frowning slightly.

The babble broke out again.

“Yes, but he said we were really behind — ”

“ — he wouldn’t listen — ”

 

“ — two rolls of parchmenti”

Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on

every face.

“Don’t worry. I’ll speak to Professor Snape. You don’t

have to do the essay.”

“Oh no,” said Hermione, looking very disappointed.

“I’ve already finished it!”

They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin

had brought along a glass box containing a

hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as

though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail

and harmless-looking.

“Lures travelers into bogs,” said Professor Lupin as

they took notes. “You notice the lantern dangling from

his hand? Hops ahead — people follow the light —

then — ’ ”

The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise

against the glass.

When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things

and headed for the door, Harry among them, but —

“Wait a moment, Harry,” Lupin called. “I’d like a

word.”

Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin

covering the hinkypunk’s box with a cloth.

“I heard about the match,” said Lupin, turning back

to his desk and starting to pile books into his

briefcase, “and I’m sorry about your broomstick. Is

there any chance of fixing it?”

 

“No,” said Harry. “The tree smashed it to bits.”

Lupin sighed.

“They planted the Whomping Willow the same year

that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a

game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In

the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an

eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No

broomstick would have a chance.

“Did you hear about the dementors too?” said Harry

with difficulty.

Lupin looked at him quickly.

“Yes, I did. I don’t think any of us have seen Professor

Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing

restless for some time ... furious at his refusal to let

them inside the grounds. ... I suppose they were the

reason you fell?”

“Yes,” said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question

he had to ask burst from him before he could stop

himself. “ Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I

just — ?”

“It has nothing to do with weakness,” said Professor

Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry’s mind.

“The dementors affect you worse than the others

because there are horrors in your past that the others

don’t have.”

A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom,

illuminating Lupin’s gray hairs and the lines on his

young face.

“Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk

this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places,

 

they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace,

hope, and happiness out of the air around them.

Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can’t

see them. Get too near a dementor and every good

feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of

you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long

enough to reduce you to something like itself . . . soul-

less and evil. You’ll be left with nothing but the worst

experiences of your life. And the worst that happened

to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their

broom. You have nothing to feel ashamed of.”

“When they get near me — ” Harry stared at Lupin’s

desk, his throat tight. “I can hear Voldemort

murdering my mum.”

Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though

to grip Harry’s shoulder, but thought better of it.

There was a moment’s silence, then —

“Why did they have to come to the match?” said Harry

bitterly.

“They’re getting hungry,” said Lupin coolly, shutting

his briefcase with a snap. “Dumbledore won’t let them

into the school, so their supply of human prey has

dried up. ... I don’t think they could resist the large

crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement

. . . emotions running high ... it was their idea of a

feast.”

“Azkaban must be terrible,” Harry muttered. Lupin

nodded grimly.

“The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea,

but they don’t need walls and water to keep the

prisoners in, not when they’re all trapped inside their

own heads, incapable of a single cheerful thought.

Most of them go mad within weeks.”

 

“But Sirius Black escaped from them,” Harry said

slowly. “He got away. ...”

Lupin’s briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to

stoop quickly to catch it.

“Yes,” he said, straightening up, “Black must have

found a way to fight them. I wouldn’t have believed it

possible. ... Dementors are supposed to drain a

wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long.

“You made that dementor on the train back off,” said

Harry suddenly.

“There are — certain defenses one can use,” said

Lupin. “But there was only one dementor on the train.

The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to

resist.”

“What defenses?” said Harry at once. “Can you teach

me?”

“I don’t pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors,

Harry ... quite the contrary. ...”

“But if the dementors come to another Quidditch

match, I need to be able to fight them — ”

Lupin looked into Harry’s determined face, hesitated,

then said, “Well ... all right. I’ll try and help. But it’ll

have to wait until next term, I’m afraid. I have a lot to

do before the holidays. I chose a very inconvenient

time to fall ill.”

What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from

Lupin, the thought that he might never have to hear

his mother’s death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw

flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the

 

end of November, Harry’s mood took a definite

upturn. Gryffindor were not out of the running after

all, although they could not afford to lose another

match. Wood became repossessed of his manic

energy, and worked his team as hard as ever in the

chilly haze of rain that persisted into December.

Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds.

Dumbledore’s anger seemed to be keeping them at

their stations at the entrances.

Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky

lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and

the muddy grounds were revealed one morning

covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was

a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the

Charms teacher, had already decorated his classroom

with shimmering lights that turned out to be real,

fluttering fairies. The students were all happily

discussing their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and

Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and

though Ron said it was because he couldn’t stand two

weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed

to use the library, Harry wasn’t fooled; they were

doing it to keep him company, and he was very

grateful.

To everyone’s delight except Harry’s, there was to be

another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of

the term.

“We can do all our Christmas shopping there!” said

Hermione. “Mum and Dad would really love those

Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!”

Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third

year staying behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of

Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend

the day reading up on the different makes. He had

been riding one of the school brooms at team

 

practice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very

slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of

his own.

On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip,

Harry bid good-bye to Ron and Hermione, who were

wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the

marble staircase alone, and headed back toward

Gryffindor Tower. Snow had started to fall outside the

windows, and the castle was very still and quiet.

“Psst — Harry!”

He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to

see Fred and George peering out at him from behind a

statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch.

“What are you doing?” said Harry curiously. “How

come you’re not going to Hogsmeade?”

“We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before

we go,” said Fred, with a mysterious wink. “Come in

here. ...”

He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of

the one-eyed statue. Harry followed Fred and George

inside. George closed the door quietly and then

turned, beaming, to look at Harry.

“Early Christmas present for you, Harry,” he said.

Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a

flourish and laid it on one of the desks. It was a large,

square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing

written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and

George’s jokes, stared at it.

“What’s that supposed to be?”

 

“This, Harry, is the secret of our success,” said

George, patting the parchment fondly.

“It’s a wrench, giving it to you,” said Fred, “but we

decided last night, your need’s greater than ours.”

“Anyway, we know it by heart,” said George. “We

bequeath it to you. We don’t really need it anymore.”

“And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?”

said Harry.

“A bit of old parchment!” said Fred, closing his eyes

with a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended

him. “Explain, George.”

“Well ... when we were in our first year, Harry —

young, carefree, and innocent — ”

Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George

had ever been innocent.

“ — well, more innocent than we are now — we got

into a spot of bother with Filch.”

“We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset

him for some reason — ”

“So he hauled us off to his office and started

threatening us with the usual — ”

“ — detention — ”

“ — disembowelment — ”

“ — and we couldn’t help noticing a drawer in one of

his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly

Dangerous.”

 

“Don’t tell me — ” said Harry, starting to grin.

“Well, what would you’ve done?” said Fred. “George

caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I

whipped the drawer open, and grabbed — this.”

“It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know,” said George.

“We don’t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it.

He probably suspected what it was, though, or he

wouldn’t have confiscated it.”

“And you know how to work it?”

“Oh yes,” said Fred, smirking. “This little beauty’s

taught us more than all the teachers in this school.”

“You’re winding me up,” said Harry, looking at the

ragged old bit of parchment.

“Oh, are we?” said George.

He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly,

and said, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”

And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a

spider’s web from the point that George’s wand had

touched. They joined each other, they crisscrossed,

they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then

words began to blossom across the top, great, curly

green words, that proclaimed:

Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs

Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers

are proud to present

THE MARAUDER’S MAP

 

It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts

castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing

were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled

with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry

bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner

showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his

study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling

the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was

currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as

Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar

corridors, he noticed something else.

This map showed a set of passages he had never

entered. And many of them seemed to lead —

“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of

them with his finger. “There are seven in all. Now,

Filch knows about these four” — he pointed them out

— “but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know

about these. Don’t bother with the one behind the

mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last

winter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And

we don’t reckon anyone’s ever used this one, because

the Whomping Willow’s planted right over the

entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into

the cellar of Honeydukes. We’ve used it loads of times.

And as you might’ve noticed, the entrance is right

outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone’s

hump.”

“Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,” sighed

George, patting the heading of the map. “We owe

them so much.”

“Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new

generation of law-breakers,” said Fred solemnly.

“Right,” said George briskly. “Don’t forget to wipe it

after you’ve used it — ”

 

“ — or anyone can read it,” Fred said warningly.

“Just tap it again and say, ‘Mischief managed!’ And

it’ll go blank.”

“So, young Harry,” said Fred, in an uncanny

impersonation of Percy, “mind you behave yourself.”

“See you in Honeydukes,” said George, winking.

They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of

way.

Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He

watched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause

to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn’t

know ... he wouldn’t have to pass the dementors at

all. ...

But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement,

something Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say

came floating out of his memory.

Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you

can’t see where it keeps its brain.

This map was one of those dangerous magical objects

Mr. Weasley had been warning against. ... Aids for

Magical Mischief-Makers . . . but then, Harry reasoned,

he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it

wasn’t as though he wanted to steal anything or

attack anyone ... and Fred and George had been

using it for years without anything horrible

happening. ...

Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with

his finger.

 

Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he

rolled up the map, stuffed it inside his robes, and

hurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a

couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very

carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the

statue of the one-eyed witch.

What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again

and saw, to his astonishment, that a new ink figure

had appeared upon it, labeled Harry Potter. This

figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was

standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor.

Harry watched carefully. His little ink self appeared to

be tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry

quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue.

Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The

tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure.

The word inside said, “ Dissendium.”

“ Dissendiurrd” Harry whispered, tapping the stone

witch again.

At once, the statue’s hump opened wide enough to

admit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up

and down the corridor, then tucked the map away

again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and

pushed himself forward.

He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone

slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up,

looking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his

wand, muttered, “Lumos\” and saw that he was in a

very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the

map, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and

muttered, “Mischief managed!” The map went blank

at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his

robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and

apprehensive, he set off.

 

The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow

of a giant rabbit than anything else. Harry hurried

along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor,

holding his wand out in front of him.

It took ages, but Harry had the thought of

Honeydukes to sustain him. After what felt like an

hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped

up, his face hot, his feet very cold.

Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn

stone steps, which rose out of sight above him.

Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb.

A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as

he climbed, watching his feet. ... Then, without

warning, his head hit something hard.

It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there,

massaging the top of his head, listening. He couldn’t

hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he pushed

the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.

He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates

and boxes. Harry climbed out of the trapdoor and

replaced it — it blended so perfectly with the dusty

floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry

crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led

upstairs. Now he could definitely hear voices, not to

mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and

shutting of a door.

Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a

door open much closer at hand; somebody was about

to come downstairs.

“And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they’ve

nearly cleaned us out — ” said a woman’s voice.

 

A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry

leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the

footsteps to pass. He heard the man shifting boxes

against the opposite wall. He might not get another

chance —

Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his

hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back, he

saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head,

buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of

the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself

behind the counter of Honeydukes — he ducked,

crept sideways, and then straightened up.

Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students

that no one looked twice at Harry. He edged among

them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he

imagined the look that would spread over Dudley’s

piggy face if he could see where Harry was now.

There were shelves upon shelves of the most

succulent-looking sweets imaginable. Creamy chunks

of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut ice,

fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds

of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of

Every Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees,

the levitating sherbert balls that Ron had mentioned;

along yet another wall were “Special Effects” sweets:

Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with

bluebell-colored bubbles that refused to pop for days),

the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny

black Pepper Imps (“breathe fire for your friends!”),

Ice Mice (“hear your teeth chatter and squeak!”),

peppermint creams shaped like toads (“hop

realistically in the stomach!”), fragile sugar-spun

quills, and exploding bonbons.

Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth

years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of

 

the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and Hermione

were standing underneath it, examining a tray of

blood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind

them.

“Ugh, no, Harry won’t want one of those, they’re for

vampires, I expect,” Hermione was saying.

“How about these?” said Ron, shoving ajar of

Cockroach Clusters under Hermione ’s nose.

“Definitely not,” said Harry.

Ron nearly dropped the jar.

“Harry\” squealed Hermione. “What are you doing

here? How — how did you — ?”

“Wow!” said Ron, looking very impressed, “you’ve

learned to Apparate!”

“ ’Course I haven’t,” said Harry. He dropped his voice

so that none of the sixth years could hear him and

told them all about the Marauder’s Map.

“How come Fred and George never gave it to me!” said

Ron, outraged. “I’m their brother!”

“But Harry isn’t going to keep it!” said Hermione, as

though the idea were ludicrous. “He’s going to hand it

in to Professor McGonagall, aren’t you, Harry?”

“No, I’m not!” said Harry.

“Are you mad?” said Ron, goggling at Hermione.

“Hand in something that good?”

“If I hand it in, I’ll have to say where I got it! Filch

would know Fred and George had nicked it!”

 

“But what about Sirius Black?” Hermione hissed. “He

could be using one of the passages on that map to get

into the castle! The teachers have got to know!”

“He can’t be getting in through a passage,” said Harry

quickly. “There are seven secret tunnels on the map,

right? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows

about four of them. And of the other three — one of

them’s caved in, so no one can get through it. One of

them’s got the Whomping Willow planted over the

entrance, so you can’t get out of it. And the one I just

came through — well — it’s really hard to see the

entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it

was there ...”

Harry hesitated. What if Black did know the passage

was there? Ron, however, cleared his throat

significantly, and pointed to a notice pasted on the

inside of the sweetshop door.

— BY ORDER OF —

THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC

Customers are reminded that until further notice,

dementors will be patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade

every night after sundown. This measure has been put

in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and will

be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is

therefore advisable that you complete your shopping

well before nightfall.

Merry Christmas!

“See?” said Ron quietly. “I’d like to see Black try and

break into Honeydukes with dementors swarming all

 

over the village. Anyway, Hermione, the Honeydukes

owners would hear a break-in, wouldn’t they? They

live over the shop!”

“Yes, but — but — ” Hermoine seemed to be struggling

to find another problem. “Look, Harry still shouldn’t

be coming into Hogsmeade. He hasn’t got a signed

form! If anyone finds out, he’ll be in so much trouble!

And it’s not nightfall yet — what if Sirius Black turns

up today? Now?”

“He’d have a job spotting Harry in this,” said Ron,

nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick,

swirling snow. “Come on, Hermione, it’s Christmas.

Harry deserves a break.”

Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried.

“Are you going to report me?” Harry asked her,

grinning.

“Oh — of course not — but honestly, Harry — ”

“Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?” said Ron,

grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel.

“And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred gave

me one of those when I was seven — it burnt a hole

right through my tongue. I remember Mum walloping

him with her broomstick.” Ron stared broodingly into

the Acid Pop box. “Reckon Fred’d take a bit of

Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?”

When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets,

the three of them left Honeydukes for the blizzard

outside.

Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little

thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a

layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the

 

doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in

the trees.

Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn’t have

his cloak. They headed up the street, heads bowed

against the wind, Ron and Hermione shouting

through their scarves.

“That’s the post office — ”

“Zonko’s is up there — ”

“We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — ”

“Tell you what,” said Ron, his teeth chattering, “shall

we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?”

Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and

his hands were freezing, so they crossed the road,

and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.

It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A

curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a

bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar.

“That’s Madam Rosmerta,” said Ron. “I’ll get the

drinks, shall I?” he added, going slightly red.

Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of

the room, where there was a small, vacant table

between the window and a handsome Christmas tree,

which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five

minutes later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot

butterbeer.

“Merry Christmas!” he said happily, raising his

tankard.

 

Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing

he’d ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him

from the inside.

A sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the

Three Broomsticks had opened again. Harry looked

over the rim of his tankard and choked.

Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered

the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed

by Hagrid, who was deep in conversation with a portly

man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped

cloak — Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed

hands on the top of Harry’s head and forced him off

his stool and under the table. Dripping with

butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched

his empty tankard and watched the teachers’ and

Fudge’s feet move toward the bar, pause, then turn

and walk right toward him.

Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered,

“Mobiliarbus\”

The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few

inches off the ground, drifted sideways, and landed

with a soft thump right in front of their table, hiding

them from view. Staring through the dense lower

branches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back

from the table right beside theirs, then heard the

grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they

sat down.

Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly

turquoise high heels, and heard a woman’s voice.

“A small gillywater — ”

 

“Mine,” said Professor McGonagall’s voice.

“Four pints of mulled mead — ”

“Ta, Rosmerta,” said Hagrid.

“A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella — ”

“Mmm!” said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.

“So you 11 be the red currant rum, Minister.”

“Thank you, Rosmerta, m’dear,” said Fudge’s voice.

“Lovely to see you again, I must say. Have one

yourself, won’t you? Come and join us. ...”

“Well, thank you very much, Minister.”

Harry watched the glittering heels march away and

back again. His heart was pounding uncomfortably in

his throat. Why hadn’t it occurred to him that this

was the last weekend of term for the teachers too?

And how long were they going to sit there? He needed

time to sneak back into Honeydukes if he wanted to

return to school tonight. ... Hermione’s leg gave a

nervous twitch next to him.

“So, what brings you to this neck of the woods,

Minister?” came Madam Rosmerta’s voice.

Harry saw the lower part of Fudge’s thick body twist

in his chair as though he were checking for

eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet voice, “What

else, m’dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard

what happened up at the school at Halloween?”

“I did hear a rumor,” admitted Madam Rosmerta.

 

“Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?” said Professor

McGonagall exasperatedly.

“Do you think Black’s still in the area, Minister?”

whispered Madam Rosmerta.

“I’m sure of it,” said Fudge shortly.

“You know that the dementors have searched the

whole village twice?” said Madam Rosmerta, a slight

edge to her voice. “Scared all my customers away. ...

It’s very bad for business, Minister.”

“Rosmerta, m’dear, I don’t like them any more than

you do,” said Fudge uncomfortably. “Necessary

precaution ... unfortunate, but there you are. ... I’ve

just met some of them. They’re in a fury against

Dumbledore — he won’t let them inside the castle

grounds.”

“I should think not,” said Professor McGonagall

sharply. “How are we supposed to teach with those

horrors floating around?”

“Hear, hear!” squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose

feet were dangling a foot from the ground.

“All the same,” demurred Fudge, “they are here to

protect you all from something much worse. ... We all

know what Black’s capable of. ...”

“Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,” said

Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully. “Of all the people to

go over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I’d

have thought ... I mean, I remember him when he was

a boy at Hogwarts. If you’d told me then what he was

going to become, I’d have said you’d had too much

mead.”

 

“You don’t know the half of it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge

gruffly. “The worst he did isn’t widely known.”

“The worst?” said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive

with curiosity. “Worse than murdering all those poor

people, you mean?”

“I certainly do,” said Fudge.

“I can’t believe that. What could possibly be worse?”

“You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,”

murmured Professor McGonagall. “Do you remember

who his best friend was?”

“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small

laugh. “Never saw one without the other, did you? The

number of times I had them in here — ooh, they used

to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black

and James Potter!”

Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron

kicked him.

“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and

Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very

bright, of course — exceptionally bright, in fact — but

I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of

troublemakers — ”

“I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George

Weasley could give ’em a run fer their money.”

“You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!”

chimed in Professor Flitwick. “Inseparable!”

“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted

Black beyond all his other friends. Nothing changed

when they left school. Black was best man when

 

James married Lily. Then they named him godfather

to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can

imagine how the idea would torment him.”

“Because Black turned out to be in league with You-

Know-Who?” whispered Madam Rosmerta.

“Worse even than that, m’dear. ...” Fudge dropped his

voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. “Not

many people are aware that the Potters knew You-

Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of

course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had

a number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off,

and he alerted James and Lily at once. He advised

them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-

Who wasn’t an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore

told them that their best chance was the Fidelius

Charm.”

“How does that work?” said Madam Rosmerta,

breathless with interest. Professor Flitwick cleared his

throat.

“An immensely complex spell,” he said squeakily,

“involving the magical concealment of a secret inside

a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside

the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is

henceforth impossible to find — unless, of course, the

Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the

Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could

search the village where Lily and James were staying

for years and never find them, not even if he had his

nose pressed against their sitting room window!”

“So Black was the Potters’ Secret-Keeper?” whispered

Madam Rosmerta.

“Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “James Potter

told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell

 

where they were, that Black was planning to go into

hiding himself . . . and yet, Dumbledore remained

worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters’

Secret-Keeper himself.”

“He suspected Black?” gasped Madam Rosmerta.

“He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had

been keeping You-Know-Who informed of their

movements,” said Professor McGonagall darkly.

“Indeed, he had suspected for some time that

someone on our side had turned traitor and was

passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.”

“But James Potter insisted on using Black?”

“He did,” said Fudge heavily. “And then, barely a week

after the Fidelius Charm had been performed — ”

“Black betrayed them?” breathed Madam Rosmerta.

“He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent

role, he was ready to declare his support openly for

You-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this

for the moment of the Potters’ death. But, as we all

know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry

Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled. And

this left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His

master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black,

had shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no

choice but to run for it — ”

“Filthy, stinkin’ turncoat!” Hagrid said, so loudly that

half the bar went quiet.

“Shh!” said Professor McGonagall.

“I met him!” growled Hagrid. “I musta bin the last ter

see him before he killed all them people! It was me

 

what rescued Harry from Lily an’ James’s house after

they was killed! Jus’ got him outta the ruins, poor

little thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an’

his parents dead ... an’ Sirius Black turns up, on that

flyin’ motorbike he used ter ride. Never occurred ter

me what he was doin’ there. I didn’ know he’d bin Lily

an’ James’s Secret-Keeper. Thought he’d jus’ heard

the news o’ You- Know- Who’s attack an’ come ter see

what he could do. White an’ shakin’, he was. An’ yeh

know what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN’

TRAITOR!” Hagrid roared.

“Hagrid, please!” said Professor McGonagall. “Keep

your voice down!”

“How was I ter know he wasn’ upset abou’ Lily an’

James? It was You-Know-Who he cared abou’! An’

then he says, ‘Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I’m his

godfather, I’ll look after him — ’ Ha! But I’d had me

orders from Dumbledore, an’ I told Black no,

Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an’

uncle’s. Black argued, but in the end he gave in. Told

me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. ‘I won’t

need it anymore,’ he says.

“I shoulda known there was somethin’ fishy goin’ on

then. He loved that motorbike, what was he givin’ it

ter me for? Why wouldn’ he need it anymore? Fact

was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he’d

bin the Potters’ Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was

goin’ ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a

matter o’ hours before the Ministry was after him.

“But what if I’d given Harry to him, eh? I bet he ’d’ve

pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes’

friends’ son! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark

Side, there’s nothin’ and no one that matters to ’em

anymore. ...”

 

A long silence followed Hagrid ’s story. Then Madam

Rosmerta said with some satisfaction, “But he didn’t

manage to disappear, did he? The Ministry of Magic

caught up with him next day!”

“Alas, if only we had,” said Fudge bitterly. “It was not

we who found him. It was little Peter Pettigrew —

another of the Potters’ friends. Maddened by grief, no

doubt, and knowing that Black had been the Potters’

Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.”

“Pettigrew . . . that fat little boy who was always

tagging around after them at Hogwarts?” said Madam

Rosmerta.

“Hero-worshipped Black and Potter,” said Professor

McGonagall. “Never quite in their league, talent-wise.

I was often rather sharp with him. You can imagine

how I — how I regret that now. ...” She sounded as

though she had a sudden head cold.

“There, now, Minerva,” said Fudge kindly, “Pettigrew

died a hero’s death. Eyewitnesses — Muggles, of

course, we wiped their memories later — told us how

Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing,

“Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?’ And then he

went for his wand. Well, of course, Black was quicker.

Blew Pettigrew to smithereens. ...”

Professor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly,

“Stupid boy . . . foolish boy ... he was always hopeless

at dueling ... should have left it to the Ministry. ...”

“I tell yeh, if I’d got ter Black before little Pettigrew

did, I wouldn’t’ve messed around with wands — I’d’ve

ripped him limb — from — limb,” Hagrid growled.

“You don’t know what you’re talking about, Hagrid,”

said Fudge sharply. “Nobody but trained Hit Wizards

 

from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have

stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I

was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical

Catastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on

the scene after Black murdered all those people. I — I

will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A

crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had

cracked the sewer below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles

screaming. And Black standing there laughing, with

what was left of Pettigrew in front of him ... a heap of

bloodstained robes and a few — a few fragments — ”

Fudge’s voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound

of five noses being blown.

“Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge

thickly. “Black was taken away by twenty members of

the Magical Law Enforcement Squad and Pettigrew

received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I

think was some comfort to his poor mother. Black’s

been in Azkaban ever since.”

Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.

“Is it true he’s mad, Minister?”

“I wish I could say that he was,” said Fudge slowly. “I

certainly believe his master’s defeat unhinged him for

a while. The murder of Pettigrew and all those

Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate

man — cruel ... pointless. Yet I met Black on my last

inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the

prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the

dark; there’s no sense in them ... but I was shocked

at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite

rationally to me. It was unnerving. You’d have

thought he was merely bored — asked if I’d finished

with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he

missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at

 

how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on

him — and he was one of the most heavily guarded in

the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day

and night.”

“But what do you think he’s broken out to do?” said

Madam Rosmerta. “Good gracious, Minister, he isn’t

trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?”

“I daresay that is his — er — eventual plan,” said

Fudge evasively. “But we hope to catch Black long

before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and

friendless is one thing . . . but give him back his most

devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly

he’ll rise again. ...”

There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone

had set down their glass.

“You know, Cornelius, if you’re dining with the

headmaster, we’d better head back up to the castle,”

said Professor McGonagall.

One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the

weight of their owners once more; hems of cloaks

swung into sight, and Madam Rosemerta’s glittering

heels disappeared behind the bar. The door of the

Three Broomsticks opened again, there was another

flurry of snow, and the teachers had disappeared.

“Harry?”

Ron’s and Hermione’s faces appeared under the table.

They were both staring at him, lost for words.

 

THE FIREBOLT

Harry didn’t have a very clear idea of how he had

managed to get back into the Honeydukes cellar,

through the tunnel, and into the castle once more. All

he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no

time at all, and that he hardly noticed what he was

doing, because his head was still pounding with the

conversation he had just heard.

Why had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid,

Mr. Weasley, Cornelius Fudge ... why hadn’t anyone

ever mentioned the fact that Harry’s parents had died

because their best friend had betrayed them?

Ron and Hermione watched Harry nervously all

through dinner, not daring to talk about what they’d

overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them.

When they went upstairs to the crowded common

room, it was to find Fred and George had set off half a

dozen Dungbombs in a fit of end-of-term high spirits.

Harry, who didn’t want Fred and George asking him

whether he’d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked

quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed

 

straight for his bedside cabinet. He pushed his books

aside and quickly found what he was looking for —

the leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him

two years ago, which was full of wizard pictures of his

mother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the

hangings around him, and started turning the pages,

searching, until ...

He stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day.

There was his father waving up at him, beaming, the

untidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in

all directions. There was his mother, alight with

happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there ...

that must be him. Their best man ... Harry had never

given him a thought before.

If he hadn’t known it was the same person, he would

never have guessed it was Black in this old

photograph. His face wasn’t sunken and waxy, but

handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been

working for Voldemort when this picture had been

taken? Was he already planning the deaths of the two

people next to him? Did he realize he was facing

twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would

make him unrecognizable?

But the dementors don’t affect him, Harry thought,

staring into the handsome, laughing face. He doesn’t

have to hear my mum screaming if they get too close —

Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and

stuffed it back into his cabinet, took off his robe and

glasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings

were hiding him from view.

The dormitory door opened.

“Harry?” said Ron’s voice uncertainly.

 

But Harry lay still, pretending to be asleep. He heard

Ron leave again, and rolled over on his back, his eyes

wide open.

A hatred such as he had never known before was

coursing through Harry like poison. He could see

Black laughing at him through the darkness, as

though somebody had pasted the picture from the

album over his eyes. He watched, as though

somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius

Black blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville

Longbottom) into a thousand pieces. He could hear

(though having no idea what Black’s voice might

sound like) a low, excited mutter. “It has happened,

My Lord . . . the Potters have made me their Secret-

Keeper. ...” And then came another voice, laughing

shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his

head whenever the dementors drew near. . . .

“Harry, you — you look terrible.”

Harry hadn’t gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had

awoken to find the dormitory deserted, dressed, and

gone down the spiral staircase to a common room

that was completely empty except for Ron, who was

eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging his

stomach, and Hermione, who had spread her

homework over three tables.

“Where is everyone?” said Harry.

“Gone! It’s the first day of the holidays, remember?”

said Ron, watching Harry closely. “It’s nearly

lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up in a

minute.”

Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was

still falling outside the windows. Crookshanks was

spread out in front of the fire like a large, ginger rug.

 

“You really don’t look well, you know,” Hermione said,

peering anxiously into his face.

“I’m fine,” said Harry.

“Harry, listen,” said Hermione, exchanging a look with

Ron, “you must be really upset about what we heard

yesterday. But the thing is, you mustn’t go doing

anything stupid.”

“Like what?” said Harry.

“Like trying to go after Black,” said Ron sharply.

Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation

while he had been asleep. He didn’t say anything.

“You won’t, will you, Harry?” said Hermione.

“Because Black’s not worth dying for,” said Ron.

Harry looked at them. They didn’t seem to

understand at all.

“D’you know what I see and hear every time a

dementor gets too near me?” Ron and Hermione

shook their heads, looking apprehensive. “I can hear

my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort.

And if you’d heard your mum screaming like that,

just about to be killed, you wouldn’t forget it in a

hurry. And if you found out someone who was

supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent

Voldemort after her — ”

“There’s nothing you can do!” said Hermione, looking

stricken. “The dementors will catch Black and he’ll go

back to Azkaban and — and serve him right!”

 

“You heard what Fudge said. Black isn’t affected by

Azkaban like normal people are. It’s not a

punishment for him like it is for the others.”

“So what are you saying?” said Ron, looking very

tense. “You want to — to kill Black or something?”

“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione in a panicky voice.

“Harry doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you, Harry?”

Again, Harry didn’t answer. He didn’t know what he

wanted to do. All he knew was that the idea of doing

nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more

than he could stand.

“Malfoy knows,” he said abruptly. “Remember what

he said to me in Potions? ‘If it was me, I’d hunt him

down myself. ... I’d want revenge.’ ”

“You’re going to take Malfoy ’s advice instead of ours?”

said Ron furiously. “Listen ... you know what

Pettigrew’s mother got back after Black had finished

with him? Dad told me — the Order of Merlin, First

Class, and Pettigrew’s finger in a box. That was the

biggest bit of him they could find. Black’s a madman,

Harry, and he’s dangerous — ”

“Malfoy’s dad must have told him,” said Harry,

ignoring Ron. “He was right in Voldemort’s inner

circle — ”

“ Say You-Knotu-Who, will you?” interjected Ron

angrily.

“ — so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working

for Voldemort — ”

“ — and Malfoy’d love to see you blown into about a

million pieces, like Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy’s just

 

hoping you 11 get yourself killed before he has to play

you at Quidditch.”

“Harry, please,” said Hermione, her eyes now shining

with tears, “please be sensible. Black did a terrible,

terrible thing, but d-don’t put yourself in danger, it’s

what Black wants. ... Oh, Harry, you’d be playing

right into Black’s hands if you went looking for him.

Your mum and dad wouldn’t want you to get hurt,

would they? They’d never want you to go looking for

Black!”

“I’ll never know what they’d have wanted, because

thanks to Black, I’ve never spoken to them,” said

Harry shortly.

There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched

luxuriously, flexing his claws. Ron’s pocket quivered.

“Look,” said Ron, obviously casting around for a

change of subject, “it’s the holidays! It’s nearly

Christmas! Let’s — let’s go down and see Hagrid. We

haven’t visited him for ages!”

“No!” said Hermione quickly. “Harry isn’t supposed to

leave the castle, Ron — ”

“Yeah, let’s go,” said Harry, sitting up, “and I can ask

him how come he never mentioned Black when he

told me all about my parents!”

Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn’t

what Ron had had in mind.

“Or we could have a game of chess,” he said hastily,

“or Gobstones. Percy left a set — ”

“No, let’s visit Hagrid,” said Harry firmly.

 

So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set

off through the portrait hole (“Stand and fight, you

yellow-bellied mongrels!”), down through the empty

castle and out through the oak front doors.

They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a

shallow trench in the glittering, powdery snow, their

socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and

freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it

had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver,

and Hagrid’s cabin looked like an iced cake.

Ron knocked, but there was no answer.

“He’s not out, is he?” said Hermione, who was

shivering under her cloak.

Ron had his ear to the door.

“There’s a weird noise,” he said. “Listen — is that

Fang?”

Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too.

From inside the cabin came a series of low, throbbing

moans.

“Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron

nervously.

“Hagrid!” called Harry, thumping the door. “Hagrid,

are you in there?”

There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door

creaked open. Hagrid stood there with his eyes red

and swollen, tears splashing down the front of his

leather vest.

“Yeh’ve heard?” he bellowed, and he flung himself

onto Harry’s neck.

 

Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man,

this was no laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse

under Hagrid’s weight, was rescued by Ron and

Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and

heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed

himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over

the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with

tears that dripped down into his tangled beard.

“Hagrid, what is it?” said Hermione, aghast.

Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on

the table.

“What’s this, Hagrid?”

Hagrid’s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter

toward Harry, who picked it up and read aloud:

Dear Mr. Hagrid,

Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on

a student in your class, we have accepted the

assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no

responsibility for the regrettable incident.

“Well, that’s okay then, Hagrid!” said Ron, clapping

Hagrid on the shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob,

and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting Harry to

read on.

However, we must register our concern about the

hippogriff in question. We have decided to uphold the

official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy, and this matter

will therefore be taken to the Committee for the

Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take

place on April 20th, and we ask you to present

yourself and your hippogriff at the Committee’s offices

 

in London on that date. In the meantime, the hippogriff

should be kept tethered and isolated.

Yours in fellowship ...

There followed a list of the school governors.

“Oh,” said Ron. “But you said Buckbeak isn’t a bad

hippogriff, Hagrid. I bet he’ll get off — ”

“Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer

the Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures!” choked Hagrid,

wiping his eyes on his sleeve. “They’ve got it in fer

interestin’ creatures!”

A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid ’s cabin

made Harry, Ron, and Hermione whip around.

Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,

chomping on something that was oozing blood all over

the floor.

“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!”

choked Hagrid. “All on his own! At Christmas.”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another.

They had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid about

what he called “interesting creatures” and other

people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other

hand, there didn’t seem to be any particular harm in

Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he

was positively cute.

“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,”

said Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on

Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you can prove

Buckbeak is safe.”

 

“Won’t make no difference!” sobbed Hagrid. “Them

Disposal devils, they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket!

Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case, Buckbeak — ”

Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then

gave a great wail and lurched forward, his face in his

arms.

“What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?” said Harry.

“He’s done more’n enough fer me already,” groaned

Hagrid. “Got enough on his plate what with keepin’

them dementors outta the castle, an’ Sirius Black

lurkin’ around — ”

Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though

expecting him to start berating Hagrid for not telling

him the truth about Black. But Harry couldn’t bring

himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so

miserable and scared.

“Listen, Hagrid,” he said, “you can’t give up.

Hermione’s right, you just need a good defense. You

can call us as witnesses — ”

“I’m sure I’ve read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,”

said Hermione thoughtfully, “where the hippogriff got

off. I’ll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what

happened.”

Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione

looked at Ron to help them.

“Er — shall I make a cup of tea?” said Ron.

Harry stared at him.

“It’s what my mum does whenever someone’s upset,”

Ron muttered, shrugging.

 

At last, after many more assurances of help, with a

steaming mug of tea in front of him, Hagrid blew his

nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and

said, “Yer right. I can’ afford to go ter pieces. Gotta

pull meself together. ...”

Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the

table and laid his head on Hagrid ’s knee.

“I’ve not bin meself lately,” said Hagrid, stroking Fang

with one hand and mopping his face with the other.

“Worried abou’ Buckbeak, an’ no one likin’ me classes

“We do like them!” lied Hermione at once.

“Yeah, they’re great!” said Ron, crossing his fingers

under the table. “Er — how are the flobberworms?”

“Dead,” said Hagrid gloomily. “Too much lettuce.”

“Oh no!” said Ron, his lip twitching.

“An’ them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an’

all,” said Hagrid, with a sudden shudder. “Gotta walk

past ’em ev’ry time I want a drink in the Three

Broomsticks. ’S like bein’ back in Azkaban — ”

He fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and

Hermione watched him breathlessly. They had never

heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban

before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, “Is it

awful in there, Hagrid?”

“Yeh’ve no idea,” said Hagrid quietly. “Never bin

anywhere like it. Thought I was goin’ mad. Kep’ goin’

over horrible stuff in me mind . . . the day I got

expelled from Hogwarts . . . day me dad died . . . day I

had ter let Norbert go. ...”

 

His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby

dragon Hagrid had once won in a game of cards.

“Yeh can’ really remember who yeh are after a while.

An’ yeh can’ see the point o’ livin’ at all. I used ter

hope I’d jus’ die in me sleep. ... When they let me out,

it was like bein’ born again, ev’rythin’ came floodin’

back, it was the bes’ feelin’ in the world. Mind, the

dementors weren’t keen on lettin’ me go.”

“But you were innocent!” said Hermione.

Hagrid snorted.

“Think that matters to them? They don’ care. Long as

they’ve got a couple o’ hundred humans stuck there

with ’em, so they can leech all the happiness out of

’em, they don’ give a damn who’s guilty an’ who’s

not.”

Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea.

Then he said quietly, “Thought o’ jus’ letting

Buckbeak go ... tryin’ ter make him fly away ... but

how d’yeh explain ter a hippogriff it’s gotta go inter

hidin’? An’ — an’ I’m scared o’ breakin’ the law. ...” He

looked up at them, tears leaking down his face again.

“I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.”

The trip to Hagrid’s, though far from fun, had

nevertheless had the effect Ron and Hermione had

hoped. Though Harry had by no means forgotten

about Black, he couldn’t brood constantly on revenge

if he wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the

Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.

He, Ron, and Hermione went to the library the next

day and returned to the empty common room laden

with books that might help prepare a defense for

Buckbeak. The three of them sat in front of the

roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty

 

volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts,

speaking occasionally when they ran across

something relevant.

“Here’s something ... there was a case in 1722 ... but

the hippogriff was convicted — ugh, look what they

did to it, that’s disgusting — ”

“This might help, look — a manticore savaged

someone in 1296, and they let the manticore off — oh

— no, that was only because everyone was too scared

to go near it. ...”

Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual

magnificent Christmas decorations had been put up,

despite the fact that hardly any of the students

remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and

mistletoe were strung along the corridors, mysterious

lights shone from inside every suit of armor, and the

Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve Christmas

trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and

delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and

by Christmas Eve, it had grown so strong that even

Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron’s

pocket to sniff hopefully at the air.

On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron

throwing his pillow at him.

“Oy! Presents!”

Harry reached for his glasses and put them on,

squinting through the semi-darkness to the foot of his

bed, where a small heap of parcels had appeared. Ron

was already ripping the paper off his own presents.

“Another sweater from Mum . . . maroon again . . . see if

you’ve got one.”

 

Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet

sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front,

also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas

cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these

things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying

underneath.

“What’s that?” said Ron, looking over, a freshly

unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand.

“Dunno ...”

Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a

magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his

bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his

bed for a closer look.

“I don’t believe it,” he said hoarsely.

It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry

had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle

glittered as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating

and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly

the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved

from the golden registration number at the top of the

handle, right down to the perfectly smooth,

streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.

“Who sent it to you?” said Ron in a hushed voice.

“Look and see if there’s a card,” said Harry.

Ron ripped apart the Firebolt’s wrappings.

“Nothing! Blimey, who’d spend that much on you?”

“Well,” said Harry, feeling stunned, “I’m betting it

wasn’t the Dursleys.”

 

“I bet it was Dumbledore,” said Ron, now walking

around and around the Firebolt, taking in every

glorious inch. “He sent you the Invisibility Cloak

anonymously. ...”

“That was my dad’s, though,” said Harry.

“Dumbledore was just passing it on to me. He

wouldn’t spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can’t

go giving students stuff like this — ”

“That’s why he wouldn’t say it was from him!” said

Ron. “In case some git like Malfoy said it was

favoritism. Hey, Harry” — Ron gave a great whoop of

laughter — “Malfoyl Wait till he sees you on this! He’ll

be sick as a pig! This is an international standard

broom, this is!”

“I can’t believe this,” Harry muttered, running a hand

along the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry’s bed,

laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy. “ Who

— ?”

“I know,” said Ron, controlling himself, “I know who it

could’ve been — Lupin!”

“What?” said Harry, now starting to laugh himself.

“Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he’d be able

to buy himself some new robes.”

“Yeah, but he likes you,” said Ron. “And he was away

when your Nimbus got smashed, and he might’ve

heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and

get this for you — ”

“What d’you mean, he was away?” said Harry. “He

was ill when I was playing in that match.”

 

“Well, he wasn’t in the hospital wing,” said Ron. “I

was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention

from Snape, remember?”

Harry frowned at Ron.

“I can’t see Lupin affording something like this.”

“What ’re you two laughing about?”

Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing

gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking

very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his

neck.

“Don’t bring him in here!” said Ron, hurriedly

snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and

stowing him in his pajama pocket. But Hermione

wasn’t listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto

Seamus’s empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at

the Firebolt.

“Oh, Harry\ Who sent you that?”

“No idea,” said Harry. “There wasn’t a card or

anything with it.”

To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either

excited or intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her

face fell, and she bit her lip.

“What’s the matter with you?” said Ron.

“I don’t know,” said Hermione slowly, “but it’s a bit

odd, isn’t it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a

good broom, isn’t it?”

Ron sighed exasperatedly.

 

“It’s the best broom there is, Hermione,” he said.

“So it must’ve been really expensive. ...”

“Probably cost more than all the Slytherins’ brooms

put together,” said Ron happily.

“Well ... who’d send Harry something as expensive as

that, and not even tell him they’d sent it?” said

Hermione.

“Who cares?” said Ron impatiently. “Listen, Harry,

can I have a go on it? Can I?”

“I don’t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!”

said Hermione shrilly.

Harry and Ron looked at her.

“What d’you think Harry’s going to do with it — sweep

the floor?” said Ron.

But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks

sprang from Seamus’s bed, right at Ron’s chest.

“GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE!” Ron bellowed

as Crookshanks ’s claws ripped his pajamas and

Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder.

Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a

misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at

the end of Harry’s bed, knocking it over and causing

Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.

Crookshanks ’s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill,

tinny whistling was filling the room. The Pocket

Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle

Vernon’s old socks and was whirling and gleaming on

the floor.

 

“I forgot about that!” Harry said, bending down and

picking up the Sneakoscope. “I never wear those

socks if I can help it. ...”

The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm.

Crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it.

“You’d better take that cat out of here, Hermione,”

said Ron furiously, sitting on Harry’s bed nursing his

toe. “Can’t you shut that thing up?” he added to

Harry as Hermione strode out of the room,

Crookshanks ’s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on

Ron.

Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks

and threw it back into his trunk. All that could be

heard now were Ron’s stifled moans of pain and rage.

Scabbers was huddled in Ron’s hands. It had been a

while since Harry had seen him out of Ron’s pocket,

and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that

Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches

of fur seemed to have fallen out too.

“He’s not looking too good, is he?” Harry said.

“It’s stress!” said Ron. “He’d be fine if that big stupid

furball left him alone!”

But Harry, remembering what the woman at the

Magical Menagerie had said about rats living only

three years, couldn’t help feeling that unless Scabbers

had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching

the end of his life. And despite Ron’s frequent

complaints that Scabbers was both boring and

useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if

Scabbers died.

Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in

the Gryffindor common room that morning. Hermione

 

had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was

furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was still

fuming about Crookshanks ’s fresh attempt to eat

Scabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to

each other and devoted himself to examining the

Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common

room with him. For some reason this seemed to

annoy Hermione as well; she didn’t say anything, but

she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too

had been criticizing her cat.

At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to

find that the House tables had been moved against

the walls again, and that a single table, set for twelve,

stood in the middle of the room. Professors

Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and

Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker,

who had taken off his usual brown coat and was

wearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat.

There were only three other students, two extremely

nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced

Slytherin fifth year.

“Merry Christmas!” said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron,

and Hermione approached the table. “As there are so

few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables.

... Sit down, sit down!”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at

the end of the table.

“Crackers!” said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering

the end of a large silver noisemaker to Snape, who

took it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang like a

gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large,

pointed witch’s hat topped with a stuffed vulture.

Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron’s eye

and they both grinned; Snape ’s mouth thinned and

 

he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped

it for his wizard’s hat at once.

“Dig in!” he advised the table, beaming around.

As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the

doors of the Great Hall opened again. It was Professor

Trelawney, gliding toward them as though on wheels.

She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of

the occasion, making her look more than ever like a

glittering, oversized dragonfly.

“Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!” said Dumbledore,

standing up.

“I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,” said

Professor Trelawney in her mistiest, most faraway

voice, “and to my astonishment, I saw myself

abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join

you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at

once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to

forgive my lateness. ...”

“Certainly, certainly,” said Dumbledore, his eyes

twinkling. “Let me draw you up a chair — ”

And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his

wand, which revolved for a few seconds before falling

with a thud between Professors Snape and

McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit

down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the

table, and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream.

“I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be

thirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget

that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will

be the first to die!”

 

“Well risk it, Sibyll,” said Professor McGonagall

impatiently. “Do sit down, the turkey’s getting stone

cold.”

Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself

into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched

tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the

table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into

the nearest tureen.

“Tripe, Sibyll?”

Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again,

she looked around once more and said, “But where is

dear Professor Lupin?”

“I’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,” said

Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start

serving themselves. “Most unfortunate that it should

happen on Christmas Day.”

“But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?” said

Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised.

Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very

cold look.

“Certainly I knew, Minerva,” she said quietly. “But

one does not parade the fact that one is All-Knowing.

I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the

Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.”

“That explains a great deal,” said Professor

McGonagall tartly.

Professor Trelawney’s voice suddenly became a good

deal less misty.

 

“If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor

Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He

seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He

positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him —

“Imagine that,” said Professor McGonagall dryly.

“I doubt,” said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly

raised voice, which put an end to Professor

McGonagall and Professor Trelawney’s conversation,

“that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger.

Severus, you’ve made the potion for him again?”

“Yes, Headmaster,” said Snape.

“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Then he should be up and

about in no time. ... Derek, have you had any of these

chipolatas? They’re excellent.”

The first-year boy went furiously red on being

addressed directly by Dumbledore, and took the

platter of sausages with trembling hands.

Professor Trelawney behaved almost normally until

the very end of Christmas dinner, two hours later.

Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still

wearing their party hats, Harry and Ron got up first

from the table and she shrieked loudly.

“My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?”

“Dunno,” said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry.

“I doubt it will make much difference,” said Professor

McGonagall coldly, “unless a mad axe-man is waiting

outside the doors to slaughter the first into the

entrance hall.”

 

Even Ron laughed. Professor Trelawney looked highly

affronted.

“Coming?” Harry said to Hermione.

“No,” Hermione muttered, “I want a quick word with

Professor McGonagall.”

“Probably trying to see if she can take any more

classes,” yawned Ron as they made their way into the

entrance hall, which was completely devoid of mad

axe-men.

When they reached the portrait hole, they found Sir

Cadogan enjoying a Christmas party with a couple of

monks, several previous headmasters of Hogwarts,

and his fat pony. He pushed up his visor and toasted

them with a flagon of mead.

“Merry — hie — Christmas! Password?”

“Scurvy cur,” said Ron.

“And the same to you, sir!” roared Sir Cadogan as the

painting swung forward to admit them.

Harry went straight up to the dormitory, collected the

Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione

had given him for his birthday, brought them

downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the

Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip,

and the handle was so shiny already it seemed

pointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring

it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and

Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor

McGonagall.

Though Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor

House, Harry had seen her in the common room only

 

once before, and that had been to make a very grave

announcement. He and Ron stared at her, both

holding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around them,

sat down, picked up the nearest book, and hid her

face behind it.

“So that’s it, is it?” said Professor McGonagall beadily,

walking over to the fireside and staring at the

Firebolt. “Miss Granger has just informed me that you

have been sent a broomstick, Potter.”

Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They

could see her forehead reddening over the top of her

book, which was upside down.

“May I?” said Professor McGonagall, but she didn’t

wait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of

their hands. She examined it carefully from handle to

twig-ends. “Hmm. And there was no note at all,

Potter? No card? No message of any kind?”

“No,” said Harry blankly.

“I see ... ,” said Professor McGonagall. “Well, I’m

afraid I will have to take this, Potter.”

“W — what?” said Harry, scrambling to his feet.

“Why?”

“It will need to be checked for jinxes,” said Professor

McGonagall. “Of course, I’m no expert, but I daresay

Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it

down — ”

“Strip it down?” repeated Ron, as though Professor

McGonagall was mad.

 

“It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks,” said

Professor McGonagall. “You will have it back if we are

sure it is jinx-free.”

“There’s nothing wrong with it!” said Harry, his voice

shaking slightly. “Honestly, Professor — ”

“You can’t know that, Potter,” said Professor

McGonagall, quite kindly, “not until you’ve flown it, at

any rate, and I’m afraid that is out of the question

until we are certain that it has not been tampered

with. I shall keep you informed.”

Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried

the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed

behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of

High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron,

however, rounded on Hermione.

“What did you go running to McGonagall for?”

Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in

the face, but stood up and faced Ron defiantly.

“Because I thought — and Professor McGonagall

agrees with me — that that broom was probably sent

to Harry by Sirius Black!”

 

THE PATRONUS

Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that

didn’t stop him from being angry with her. He had

been the owner of the best broom in the world for a

few short hours, and now, because of her

interference, he didn’t know whether he would ever

see it again. He was positive that there was nothing

wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state

would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts

of anti-jinx tests?

Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was

concerned, the stripping-down of a brand-new

Firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage.

Hermione, who remained convinced that she had

acted for the best, started avoiding the common room.

Harry and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the

library and didn’t try to persuade her to come back.

All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school

returned shortly after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower

became crowded and noisy again.

 

Wood sought Harry out on the night before term

started.

“Had a good Christmas?” he said, and then, without

waiting for an answer, he sat down, lowered his voice,

and said, “I’ve been doing some thinking over

Christmas, Harry. After the last match, you know. If

the dementors come to the next one ... I mean . . . we

can’t afford you to — well — ”

Wood broke off, looking awkward.

“I’m working on it,” said Harry quickly. “Professor

Lupin said he’d train me to ward off the dementors.

We should be starting this week. He said he’d have

time after Christmas.”

“Ah,” said Wood, his expression clearing. “Well, in

that case — I really didn’t want to lose you as Seeker,

Harry. And have you ordered a new broom yet?”

“No,” said Harry.

“What! You’d better get a move on, you know — you

can’t ride that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!”

“He got a Firebolt for Christmas,” said Ron.

“A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A — a real Firebolt?”

“Don’t get excited, Oliver,” said Harry gloomily. “I

haven’t got it anymore. It was confiscated.” And he

explained all about how the Firebolt was now being

checked for jinxes.

“Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?”

 

“Sirius Black,” Harry said wearily. “He’s supposed to

be after me. So McGonagall reckons he might have

sent it.”

Waving aside the information that a famous murderer

was after his Seeker, Wood said, “But Black couldn’t

have bought a Firebolt! He’s on the run! The whole

country’s on the lookout for him! How could he just

walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a

broomstick?”

“I know,” said Harry, “but McGonagall still wants to

strip it down — ”

Wood went pale.

“I’ll go and talk to her, Harry,” he promised. “I’ll make

her see reason. ... A Firebolt ... a real Firebolt, on our

team . . . She wants Gryffindor to win as much as we

do. ... I’ll make her see sense. A Firebolt ...”

Classes started again the next day. The last thing

anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the

grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had

provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their

enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson

collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing

while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and

down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first

Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun;

Professor Trelawney was now teaching them

palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry

that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.

It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was

keen to get to; after his conversation with Wood, he

wanted to get started on his anti-dementor lessons as

soon as possible.

 

“Ah yes,” said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his

promise at the end of class. “Let me see ... how about

eight o’clock on Thursday evening? The History of

Magic classroom should be large enough. ... I’ll have

to think carefully about how we’re going to do this. ...

We can’t bring a real dementor into the castle to

practice on. ...”

“Still looks ill, doesn’t he?” said Ron as they walked

down the corridor, heading to dinner. “What d’you

reckon ’s the matter with him?”

There was a loud and impatient “tuh” from behind

them. It was Hermione, who had been sitting at the

feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag, which was

so full of books it wouldn’t close.

“And what are you tutting at us for?” said Ron

irritably.

“Nothing,” said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her

bag back over her shoulder.

“Yes, you were,” said Ron. “I said I wonder what’s

wrong with Lupin, and you — ”

“Well, isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, with a look of

maddening superiority.

“If you don’t want to tell us, don’t,” snapped Ron.

“Fine,” said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.

“She doesn’t know,” said Ron, staring resentfully after

Hermione. “She’s just trying to get us to talk to her

again.”

At eight o’clock on Thursday evening, Harry left

Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom.

 

It was dark and empty when he arrived, but he lit the

lamps with his wand and had waited only five

minutes when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a

large packing case, which he heaved onto Professor

Binns’ desk.

“What’s that?” said Harry.

“Another boggart,” said Lupin, stripping off his cloak.

“I’ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and

very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch’s

filing cabinet. It’s the nearest we’ll get to a real

dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when

he sees you, so we’ll be able to practice on him. I can

store him in my office when we’re not using him;

there’s a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”

“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he

wasn’t apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin

had found such a good substitute for a real dementor.

“So ...” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand,

and indicated that Harry should do the same. “The

spell I am going to try and teach you is highly

advanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary

Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.”

“How does it work?” said Harry nervously.

“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a

Patronus,” said Lupin, “which is a kind of anti-

dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between

you and the dementor.”

Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching

behind a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club.

Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a kind of

positive force, a projection of the very things that the

dementor feeds upon — hope, happiness, the desire

 

to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as real

humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I

must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too

advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have

difficulty with it.”

“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry

curiously.

“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”

“And how do you conjure it?”

“With an incantation, which will work only if you are

concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very

happy memory.”

Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory.

Certainly, nothing that had happened to him at the

Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled on the

moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.

“Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible

the wonderful, soaring sensation of his stomach.

“The incantation is this — ” Lupin cleared his throat.

“Expecto patronum).”

“Expecto patronum,” Harry repeated under his breath,

“expecto patronum.”

“Concentrating hard on your happy memory?”

“Oh — yeah — ” said Harry, quickly forcing his

thoughts back to that first broom ride. “Expecto

patrono — no, patronum — sorry — expecto patronum,

expecto patronum — ”

 

Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his

wand; it looked like a wisp of silvery gas.

“Did you see that?” said Harry excitedly. “Something

happened!”

“Very good,” said Lupin, smiling. “Right, then — ready

to try it on a dementor?”

“Yes,” Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and

moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He

tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else

kept intruding. . . . Any second now, he might hear his

mother again . . . but he shouldn’t think that, or he

would hear her again, and he didn’t want to ... or did

he?

Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.

A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face

turned toward Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand

gripping its cloak. The lamps around the classroom

flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from

the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry,

drawing a deep, rattling breath. A wave of piercing

cold broke over him —

“Expecto patronurrd” Harry yelled. “Expecto patronum).

Expecto — ”

But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving.

. . . Harry was falling again through thick white fog,

and his mother’s voice was louder than ever, echoing

inside his head — “ Not Harry\ Not Harry\ Please — I’ll

do anything — ”

“Stand aside. Stand aside, girl\”

“Harry!”

 

Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back

on the floor. The classroom lamps were alight again.

He didn’t have to ask what had happened.

“Sorry,” he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat

trickling down behind his glasses.

“Are you all right?” said Lupin.

“Yes ...” Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks

and leaned against it.

“Here — ” Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. “Eat

this before we try again. I didn’t expect you to do it

your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if

you had.”

“It’s getting worse,” Harry muttered, biting off the

Frog’s head. “I could hear her louder that time — and

him — Voldemort — ”

Lupin looked paler than usual.

“Harry, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than

understand — ”

“I do!” said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the

Chocolate Frog into his mouth. “I’ve got to! What if

the dementors turn up at our match against

Ravenclaw? I can’t afford to fall off again. If we lose

this game we’ve lost the Quidditch Cup!”

“All right then ... ,” said Lupin. “You might want to

select another memory, a happy memory, I mean, to

concentrate on. ... That one doesn’t seem to have

been strong enough. ...”

Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when

Gryffindor had won the House Championship last

 

year had definitely qualified as very happy. He

gripped his wand tightly again and took up his

position in the middle of the classroom.

“Ready?” said Lupin, gripping the box lid.

“Ready,” said Harry, trying hard to fill his head with

happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not

dark thoughts about what was going to happen when

the box opened.

“Go!” said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went

icily cold and dark once more. The dementor glided

forward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was

extending toward Harry —

“Expecto patronum).” Harry yelled. “Expecto patronuml

Expecto pat — ”

White fog obscured his senses . . . big, blurred shapes

were moving around him ... then came a new voice, a

man’s voice, shouting, panicking —

“Lily, take Harry and go\ It’s him\ Go! Run\ I’ll hold him

off~

The sounds of someone stumbling from a room — a

door bursting open — a cackle of high-pitched

laughter —

“Harry! Harry ... wake up. ...”

Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time

it was a minute before Harry understood why he was

lying on a dusty classroom floor.

“I heard my dad,” Harry mumbled. “That’s the first

time I’ve ever heard him — he tried to take on

 

Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it.

Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his

face mingling with the sweat. He bent his face as low

as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending

to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn’t see.

“You heard James?” said Lupin in a strange voice.

“Yeah ...” Face dry, Harry looked up. “Why — you

didn’t know my dad, did you?”

“I — I did, as a matter of fact,” said Lupin. “We were

friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry — perhaps we

should leave it here for tonight. This charm is

ridiculously advanced. ... I shouldn’t have suggested

putting you through this. ...”

“No!” said Harry. He got up again. “I’ll have one more

go! I’m not thinking of happy enough things, that’s

what it is. ... Hang on. ...”

He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory

. . . one that he could turn into a good, strong

Patronus ...

The moment when he’d first found out he was a

wizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for

Hogwarts! If that wasn’t a happy memory, he didn’t

know what was. ... Concentrating very hard on how

he had felt when he’d realized he’d be leaving Privet

Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case

once more.

“Ready?” said Lupin, who looked as though he were

doing this against his better judgment.

“Concentrating hard? All right — go!”

 

He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and

the dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and

dark —

“EXPECTO PATRONUM ” Harry bellowed. “ EXPECTO

PATRONUM EXPECTO PATRONUM ”

The screaming inside Harry’s head had started again

— except this time, it sounded as though it were

coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and louder

and softer again — and he could still see the

dementor — it had halted — and then a huge, silver

shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry’s wand,

to hover between him and the dementor, and though

Harry’s legs felt like water, he was still on his feet —

though for how much longer, he wasn’t sure —

“ RiddikulusV’ roared Lupin, springing forward.

There was a loud crack, and Harry’s cloudy Patronus

vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a

chair, feeling as exhausted as if he’d just run a mile,

and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye,

he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into

the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a

silvery orb again.

“Excellent!” Lupin said, striding over to where Harry

sat. “Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!”

“Can we have another go? Just one more go?”

“Not now,” said Lupin firmly. “You’ve had enough for

one night. Here — ”

He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes’ best

chocolate.

 

“Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood.

Same time next week?”

“Okay,” said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate

and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had

rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor. A

thought had just occurred to him.

“Professor Lupin?” he said. “If you knew my dad, you

must’ve known Sirius Black as well.”

Lupin turned very quickly.

“What gives you that idea?” he said sharply.

“Nothing — I mean, I just knew they were friends at

Hogwarts too. ...”

Lupin’s face relaxed.

“Yes, I knew him,” he said shortly. “Or I thought I did.

You’d better be off, Harry, it’s getting late.”

Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor

and around a corner, then took a detour behind a

suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish

his chocolate, wishing he hadn’t mentioned Black, as

Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then

Harry’s thoughts wandered back to his mother and

father. ...

He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he

was so full of chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear

his parents’ last moments replayed inside his head,

these were the only times Harry had heard their

voices since he was a very small child. But he’d never

be able to produce a proper Patronus if he half

wanted to hear his parents again. ...

 

“They’re dead,” he told himself sternly. “They’re dead

and listening to echoes of them won’t bring them

back. You’d better get a grip on yourself if you want

that Quidditch Cup.”

He stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into

his mouth, and headed back to Gryffindor Tower.

Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of

term. Slytherin won, though narrowly. According to

Wood, this was good news for Gryffindor, who would

take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He

therefore increased the number of team practices to

five a week. This meant that with Lupin’s anti-

dementor classes, which in themselves were more

draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just

one night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he

wasn’t showing the strain nearly as much as

Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to

be getting to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione

was to be seen in a corner of the common room,

several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts,

rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy

objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; she

barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was

interrupted.

“How’s she doing it?” Ron muttered to Harry one

evening as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on

Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up.

Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of

books.

“Doing what?”

“Getting to all her classes!” Ron said. “I heard her

talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch,

this morning. They were going on about yesterday’s

lesson, but Hermione can’t’ve been there, because she

 

was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie

McMillan told me she’s never missed a Muggle

Studies class, but half of them are at the same time

as Divination, and she’s never missed one of them

either!”

Harry didn’t have time to fathom the mystery of

Hermione’s impossible schedule at the moment; he

really needed to get on with Snape’s essay. Two

seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this

time by Wood.

“Bad news, Harry. I’ve just been to see Professor

McGonagall about the Firebolt. She — er — got a bit

shirty with me. Told me I’d got my priorities wrong.

Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup

than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told

her I didn’t care if it threw you off, as long as you

caught the Snitch first.” Wood shook his head in

disbelief. “Honestly, the way she was yelling at me . . .

you’d think I’d said something terrible. ... Then I

asked her how much longer she was going to keep it.

...” He screwed up his face and imitated Professor

McGonagall’s severe voice. “ ‘As long as necessary,

Wood’ ... I reckon it’s time you ordered a new broom,

Harry. There’s an order form at the back of Which

Broomstick ... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand

and One, like Malfoy’s got.”

“I’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,” said

Harry flatly.

January faded imperceptibly into February, with no

change in the bitterly cold weather. The match

against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer,

but Harry still hadn’t ordered a new broom. He was

now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the

Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, Ron

 

standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione rushing

past with her face averted.

“No, Potter, you can’t have it back yet,” Professor

McGonagall told him the twelfth time this happened,

before he’d even opened his mouth. “We’ve checked

for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick

believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I

shall tell you once we’ve finished checking it. Now,

please stop badgering me.”

To make matters even worse, Harry’s anti-dementor

lessons were not going nearly as well as he had

hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to produce

an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-

dementor approached him, but his Patronus was too

feeble to drive the dementor away. All it did was

hover, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining Harry

of energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt

angry with himself, guilty about his secret desire to

hear his parents’ voices again.

“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said

Professor Lupin sternly in their fourth week of

practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an

indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t

passing out anymore, are you?”

“I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors

down or something,” said Harry dispiritedly. “Make

them disappear — ”

“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But

you’ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of

time. If the dementors put in an appearance at your

next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them

at bay long enough to get back to the ground.”

 

“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said

Harry.

“I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin,

smiling. “Here — you’ve earned a drink — something

from the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have tried it

before — ”

He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.

“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I

like that stuff!”

Lupin raised an eyebrow.

“Oh — Ron and Hermione brought me some back

from Hogsmeade,” Harry lied quickly.

“I see,” said Lupin, though he still looked slightly

suspicious. “Well — let’s drink to a Gryffindor victory

against Ravenclaw! Not that I’m supposed to take

sides, as a teacher ... ,” he added hastily.

They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry

voiced something he’d been wondering for a while.

“What’s under a dementor’s hood?”

Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.

“Hmmm ... well, the only people who really know are

in no condition to tell us. You see, the dementor

lowers its hood only to use its last and worst

weapon.”

“What’s that?”

“They call it the Dementor’s Kiss,” said Lupin, with a

slightly twisted smile. “It’s what dementors do to

 

those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there

must be some kind of mouth under there, because

they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim

and — and suck out his soul.”

Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.

“What — they kill — ?”

“Oh no,” said Lupin. “Much worse than that. You can

exist without your soul, you know, as long as your

brain and heart are still working. But you 11 have no

sense of self anymore, no memory, no ... anything.

There’s no chance at all of recovery. You’ll just —

exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever

... lost.”

Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, “It’s

the fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily

Prophet this morning. The Ministry have given the

dementors permission to perform it if they find him.”

Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of

someone having their soul sucked out through their

mouth. But then he thought of Black.

“He deserves it,” he said suddenly.

“You think so?” said Lupin lightly. “Do you really

think anyone deserves that?”

“Yes,” said Harry defiantly. “For ... for some things ...”

He would have liked to have told Lupin about the

conversation he’d overheard about Black in the Three

Broomsticks, about Black betraying his mother and

father, but it would have involved revealing that he’d

gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew

Lupin wouldn’t be very impressed by that. So he

 

finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the

History of Magic classroom.

Harry half wished that he hadn’t asked what was

under a dementor’s hood, the answer had been so

horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of

what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of

you that he walked headlong into Professor

McGonagall halfway up the stairs.

“Do watch where you’re going, Potter!”

“Sorry, Professor — ”

“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor

common room. Well, here it is, we’ve done everything

we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be

anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good

friend somewhere, Potter. ...”

Harry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his

Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever.

“I can have it back?” Harry said weakly. “Seriously?”

“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall, and she was

actually smiling. “I daresay you’ll need to get the feel

of it before Saturday’s match, won’t you? And Potter

— do try and win, won’t you? Or we’ll be out of the

running for the eighth year in a row, as Professor

Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night.

Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs

toward Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a corner, he

saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning from ear to

ear.

 

“She gave it to you? Excellent! Listen, can I still have

a go on it? Tomorrow?”

“Yeah ... anything ... said Harry, his heart lighter

than it had been in a month. “You know what — we

should make up with Hermione. ... She was only

trying to help. ...”

“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. “She’s in the common

room now — working, for a change — ”

They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and

saw Neville Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan,

who seemed to be refusing him entrance.

“I wrote them down!” Neville was saying tearfully.

“But I must’ve dropped them somewhere!”

“A likely tale!” roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting

Harry and Ron: “Good even, my fine young yeomen!

Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying to force

entry to the chambers within!”

“Oh, shut up,” said Ron as he and Harry drew level

with Neville.

“I’ve lost the passwords!” Neville told them miserably.

“I made him tell me what passwords he was going to

use this week, because he keeps changing them, and

now I don’t know what I’ve done with them!”

“Oddsbodikins,” said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who

looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung

forward to let them into the common room. There was

a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and

the next moment, Harry was surrounded by people

exclaiming over his Firebolt.

“Where ’d you get it, Harry?”

 

“Will you let me have a go?”

“Have you ridden it yet, Harry?”

“Ravenclaw’ll have no chance, they’re all on

Cleansweep Sevens!”

“Can I just hold it, Harry?”

After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was

passed around and admired from every angle, the

crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a clear view

of Hermione, the only person who hadn’t rushed over

to them, bent over her work and carefully avoiding

their eyes. Harry and Ron approached her table and

at last, she looked up.

“I got it back,” said Harry, grinning at her and holding

up the Firebolt.

“See, Hermione? There wasn’t anything wrong with

it!” said Ron.

“Well — there might have been!” said Hermione. “I

mean, at least you know now that it’s safe!”

“Yeah, I suppose so,” said Harry. “I’d better put it

upstairs — ”

“I’ll take it!” said Ron eagerly. “I’ve got to give

Scabbers his rat tonic.”

He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made

of glass, carried it away up the boys’ staircase.

“Can I sit down, then?” Harry asked Hermione.

“I suppose so,” said Hermione, moving a great stack

of parchment off a chair.

 

Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the

long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still

glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay

(“Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity”) and at the

rune translation Hermione was now poring over.

“How are you getting through all this stuff?” Harry

asked her.

“Oh, well — you know — working hard,” said

Hermione. Close-up, Harry saw that she looked

almost as tired as Lupin.

“Why don’t you just drop a couple of subjects?” Harry

asked, watching her lifting books as she searched for

her rune dictionary.

“I couldn’t do that!” said Hermione, looking

scandalized.

“Arithmancy looks terrible,” said Harry, picking up a

very complicated-looking number chart.

“Oh no, it’s wonderful!” said Hermione earnestly. “It’s

my favorite subject! It’s — ”

But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy,

Harry never found out. At that precise moment, a

strangled yell echoed down the boys’ staircase. The

whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at

the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing

louder and louder — and then Ron came leaping into

view, dragging with him a bedsheet.

“LOOK!” he bellowed, striding over to Hermione’s

table. “LOOK!” he yelled, shaking the sheets in her

face.

“Ron, what — ?”

 

“SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!”

Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly

bewildered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was

holding. There was something red on it. Something

that looked horribly like —

“BLOOD!” Ron yelled into the stunned silence. “HE’S

GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE

FLOOR?”

“N — no,” said Hermione in a trembling voice.

Ron threw something down onto Hermione ’s rune

translation. Hermione and Harry leaned forward.

Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several

long, ginger cat hairs.

 

GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW

It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione’s

friendship. Each was so angry with the other that

Harry couldn’t see how they’d ever make up.

Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken

Crookshanks’s attempts to eat Scabbers seriously,

hadn’t bothered to keep a close enough watch on him,

and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was

innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers

under all the boys’ beds. Hermione, meanwhile,

maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that

Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger

hairs might have been there since Christmas, and

that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever

since Crookshanks had landed on Ron’s head in the

Magical Menagerie.

Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had

eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to

Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she

lost her temper with Harry too.

 

“Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!” she said

shrilly. “First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything’s

my fault, isn’t it! Just leave me alone, Harry, I’ve got a

lot of work to do!”

Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.

“Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring

Scabbers was,” said Fred bracingly “And he’s been

off-color for ages, he was wasting away. It was

probably better for him to snuff it quickly — one

swallow — he probably didn’t feel a thing.”

“Fred\” said Ginny indignantly.

“All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it

yourself,” said George.

“He bit Goyle for us once!” Ron said miserably.

“Remember, Harry?”

“Yeah, that’s true,” said Harry.

“His finest hour,” said Fred, unable to keep a straight

face. “Let the scar on Goyle ’s finger stand as a lasting

tribute to his memory. Oh, come on, Ron, get yourself

down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what’s the

point of moaning?”

In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry

persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team’s

final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he

could have a ride on the Firebolt after they’d finished.

This did seem to take Ron’s mind off Scabbers for a

moment (“Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on

it?”) so they set off for the Quidditch field together.

Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor

practices to keep an eye on Harry, was just as

 

impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had

been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave

them the benefit of her professional opinion.

“Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a

fault, it’s a slight list to the tail end — you often find

they develop a drag after a few years. They’ve updated

the handle too, a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps,

reminds me of the old Silver Arrows — a pity they’ve

stopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a

very fine old broom it was too. ...”

She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood

said, “Er — Madam Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the

Firebolt back? We need to practice. ...”

“Oh — right — here you are, then, Potter,” said

Madam Hooch. “I’ll sit over here with Weasley ...”

She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and

the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his

final instructions for tomorrow’s match.

“Harry, I’ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing

as Seeker. It’s Cho Chang. She’s a fourth year, and

she’s pretty good. ... I really hoped she wouldn’t be fit,

she’s had some problems with injuries. ...” Wood

scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a

full recovery, then said, “On the other hand, she rides

a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke

next to the Firebolt.” He gave Harry’s broom a look of

fervent admiration, then said, “Okay, everyone, let’s

go

And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and

kicked off from the ground.

It was better than he’d ever dreamed. The Firebolt

turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his

 

thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field

at such speed that the stadium turned into a green-

and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia

Spinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly

controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes

before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again —

“Harry, I’m letting the Snitch out!” Wood called.

Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal

posts; he outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart

out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had

caught it tightly in his hand.

The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go

again, gave it a minute’s head start, then tore after it,

weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking

near Katie Bell’s knee, looped her easily, and caught

it again.

It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by

the presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed

their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit

the ground again, Wood didn’t have a single criticism

to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a

first.

“I can’t see what’s going to stop us tomorrow!” said

Wood. “Not unless — Harry, you’ve sorted out your

dementor problem, haven’t you?”

“Yeah,” said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus

and wishing it were stronger.

“The dementors won’t turn up again, Oliver.

Dumbledore’d go ballistic,” said Fred confidently.

 

“Well, let’s hope not,” said Wood. “Anyway — good

work, everyone. Let’s get back to the tower ... turn in

early — ”

“I’m staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the

Firebolt,” Harry told Wood, and while the rest of the

team headed off to the locker rooms, Harry strode

over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands

and came to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen

asleep in her seat.

“Here you go,” said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.

Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted

the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness

while Harry walked around the edge of the field,

watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch

awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not

waking her, and insisted that they go back to the

castle.

Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked

out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt’s

superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration,

and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway toward

the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw

something that made his heart turn over — a pair of

eyes, gleaming out of the darkness.

Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his

ribs.

“What’s the matter?” said Ron.

Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and

muttered, “Lumos\”

 

A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of

a tree, and illuminated its branches; there, crouching

among the budding leaves, was Crookshanks.

“Get out of here!” Ron roared, and he stooped down

and seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he

could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished

with one swish of his long ginger tail.

“See?” Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down

again. “She’s still letting him wander about wherever

he wants — probably washing down Scabbers with a

couple of birds now. ...”

Harry didn’t say anything. He took a deep breath as

relief seeped through him; he had been sure for a

moment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim.

They set off for the castle once more. Slightly

ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn’t say

anything to Ron — nor did he look left or right until

they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.

Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with

the rest of the boys in his dormitory, all of whom

seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard

of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads

turned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there was

a good deal of excited muttering. Harry saw, with

enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin team were

all looking thunderstruck.

“Did you see his face?” said Ron gleefully, looking

back at Malfoy. “He can’t believe it! This is brilliant!”

Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the

Firebolt.

“Put it here, Harry,” he said, laying the broom in the

middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its

 

name faced upward. People from the Ravenclaw and

Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look.

Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on

having acquired such a superb replacement for his

Nimbus, and Percy’s Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope

Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the

Firebolt.

“Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!” said Percy heartily

as she examined the Firebolt closely “Penelope and I

have got a bet on,” he told the team. “Ten Galleons on

the outcome of the match!”

Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry,

and went back to her table.

“Harry — make sure you win,” said Percy, in an

urgent whisper. “I haven’t got ten Galleons. Yes, I’m

coming, Penny!” And he bustled off to join her in a

piece of toast.

“Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?” said a

cold, drawling voice.

Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe

and Goyle right behind him.

“Yeah, reckon so,” said Harry casually.

“Got plenty of special features, hasn’t it?” said Malfoy,

eyes glittering maliciously. “Shame it doesn’t come

with a parachute — in case you get too near a

dementor.”

Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.

“Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,”

said Harry. “Then it could catch the Snitch for you.”

 

The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy’s pale

eyes narrowed, and he stalked away. They watched

him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put

their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether

Harry’s broom really was a Firebolt.

At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for

the locker rooms. The weather couldn’t have been

more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It

was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there

would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry,

though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement

only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear

the rest of the school moving into the stadium

beyond. Harry took off his black school robes,

removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it

inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his

Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn’t need it.

He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was

in the crowd, watching.

“You know what we’ve got to do,” said Wood as they

prepared to leave the locker rooms. “If we lose this

match, we’re out of the running. Just — just fly like

you did in practice yesterday, and we’ll be okay!”

They walked out onto the field to tumultuous

applause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were

already standing in the middle of the field. Their

Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team.

She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and

Harry couldn’t help noticing, nervous as he was, that

she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the

teams faced each other behind their captains, and he

felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he

didn’t think had anything to do with nerves.

 

“Wood, Davies, shake hands,” Madam Hooch said

briskly, and Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw

Captain.

“Mount your brooms ... on my whistle . . . three — two

— one — ”

Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed

higher and faster than any other broom; he soared

around the stadium and began squinting around for

the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary,

which was being provided by the Weasley twins’

friend Lee Jordan.

“They’re off, and the big excitement this match is the

Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor.

According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt’s going to

be the broom of choice for the national teams at this

year’s World Championship — ”

“Jordan, would you mind telling us what’s going on in

the match?” interrupted Professor McGonagall’s voice.

“Right you are, Professor — just giving a bit of

background information — the Firebolt, incidentally,

has a built-in auto-brake and — ”

“Jordan!”

“Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of

Gryffindor heading for goal ...”

Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction,

gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho

Chang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly

a very good flier — she kept cutting across him,

forcing him to change direction.

 

“Show her your acceleration, Harry!” Fred yelled as he

whooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was

aiming for Alicia.

Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the

Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. Just as

Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match,

and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw

it — the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near

one of the barriers.

Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore

after him — Harry was speeding up, excitement

flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was ten feet

away —

Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters,

came pelting out of nowhere; Harry veered off course,

avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial

seconds, the Snitch had vanished.

There was a great “Ooooooh” of disappointment from

the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for

their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley

vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger

directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll

right over in midair to avoid it.

“Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at

that Firebolt go! Potter’s really putting it through its

paces now, see it turn — Chang’s Comet is just no

match for it, the Firebolt’s precision-balance is really

noticeable in these long — ”

“JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE

FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!”

Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored

three goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty points

 

ahead — if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw

would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a

Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically — a

glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings — the Snitch was

circling the Gryffindor goal post —

Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold

ahead — but just then, Cho appeared out of thin air,

blocking him —

“HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!”

Wood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision.

“KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!”

Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was

grinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry

turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet

above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw

Cho following him. ... She’d decided to mark him

rather than search for the Snitch herself. . . . All right,

then ... if she wanted to tail him, she’d have to take

the consequences. ...

He dived again, and Cho, thinking he’d seen the

Snitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the dive

very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a

bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time

— the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the

Ravenclaw end.

He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was

winning, gaining on the Snitch with every second —

then —

“Oh!” screamed Cho, pointing.

Distracted, Harry looked down.

 

Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors,

were looking up at him.

He didn’t stop to think. Plunging a hand down the

neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and

roared, “Expecto patronum).”

Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted

from the end of his wand. He knew it had shot

directly at the dementors but didn’t pause to watch;

his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead —

he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still

grasping his wand and just managed to close his

fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.

Madam Hooch’s whistle sounded. Harry turned

around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing

down on him; next moment, the whole team was

hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his

broom. Down below he could hear the roars of the

Gryffindors in the crowd.

“That’s my boy!” Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina,

and Katie had all kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip

so tight Harry felt as though his head would come off.

In complete disarray, the team managed to make its

way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and

looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters

sprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he

knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.

“Yes!” Ron yelled, yanking Harry’s arm into the air.

“Yes! Yes!”

“Well done, Harry!” said Percy, looking delighted. “Ten

Galleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me — ”

“Good for you, Harry!” roared Seamus Finnigan.

 

“Ruddy brilliant!” boomed Hagrid over the heads of

the milling Gryffindors.

“That was quite some Patronus,” said a voice in

Harry’s ear.

Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who

looked both shaken and pleased.

“The dementors didn’t affect me at all!” Harry said

excitedly. “I didn’t feel a thing!”

“That would be because they — er — weren’t

dementors,” said Professor Lupin. “Come and see — ”

He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to

see the edge of the field.

“You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,” said Lupin.

Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground

were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the

Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove

themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked

as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle ’s

shoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of

the utmost fury on her face, was Professor

McGonagall.

“An unworthy trick!” she was shouting. “A low and

cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker!

Detention for all of you, and fifty points from

Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor

Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here

he comes now!”

If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor’s

victory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his way

through to Harry’s side, doubled up with laughter as

 

they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from

the robe, Goyle’s head still stuck inside it.

“Come on, Harry!” said George, fighting his way over.

“Party! Gryffindor common room, now!”

“Right,” said Harry, and feeling happier than he had

in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still

in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up

to the castle.

It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch

Cup; the party went on all day and well into the night.

Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of

hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of

butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of

Honeydukes sweets.

“How did you do that?” squealed Angelina Johnson as

George started throwing Peppermint Toads into the

crowd.

“With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and

Prongs,” Fred muttered in Harry’s ear.

Only one person wasn’t joining in the festivities.

Hermione, incredibly, was sitting in a corner,

attempting to read an enormous book entitled Home

Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke

away from the table where Fred and George had

started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to

her.

“Did you even come to the match?” he asked her.

“Of course I did,” said Hermione in a strangely high-

pitched voice, not looking up. “And I’m very glad we

 

won, and I think you did really well, but I need to

read this by Monday.”

“Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,”

Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering

whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the

hatchet.

“I can’t, Harry. I’ve still got four hundred and twenty-

two pages to read!” said Hermione, now sounding

slightly hysterical. “Anyway ...” She glanced over at

Ron too. “He doesn’t want me to join in.”

There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that

moment to say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn’t just been

eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies.

He used to really like them — ”

Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or

do anything, she tucked the enormous book under

her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase

to the girls’ dormitories and out of sight.

“Can’t you give her a break?” Harry asked Ron

quietly.

“No,” said Ron flatly. “If she just acted like she was

sorry — but she’ll never admit she’s wrong, Hermione.

She’s still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation

or something.”

The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor

McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown

and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they

all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to

their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last,

exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the

hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of

 

moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly

drifting off to sleep. ...

He had a very strange dream. He was walking

through a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder,

following something silvery- white. It was winding its

way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch

glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up

with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his

quarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard

hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out,

and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a

corner into a clearing and —

“AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH

! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”

Harry woke as suddenly as though he’d been hit in

the face. Disoriented in the total darkness, he

fumbled with his hangings — he could hear

movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan’s voice

from the other side of the room: “What’s going on?”

Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At

last finding the divide in his curtains, he ripped them

back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his

lamp.

Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one

side, a look of utmost terror on his face.

“Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!”

“What?”

“Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!”

“You sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?” said Dean.

 

“Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!”

They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the

dormitory door first, and they sprinted back down the

staircase. Doors opened behind them, and sleepy

voices called after them.

“Who shouted?”

“What ’re you doing?”

The common room was lit with the glow of the dying

fire, still littered with the debris from the party. It was

deserted.

“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?”

“I’m telling you, I saw him!”

“What’s all the noise?”

“Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!”

A few of the girls had come down their staircase,

pulling on dressing gowns and yawning. Boys, too,

were reappearing.

“Excellent, are we carrying on?” said Fred Weasley

brightly.

“Everyone back upstairs!” said Percy,

hurrying into the common room and pinning his

Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.

“Perce — Sirius Black!” said Ron faintly. “In our

dormitory! With a knife! Woke me up!”

The common room went very still.

 

“Nonsense!” said Percy, looking startled. “You had too

much to eat, Ron — had a nightmare — ”

“I’m telling you — ”

“Now, really, enough’s enough!”

Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the

portrait behind her as she entered the common room

and stared furiously around.

“I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but

this is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of

you!”

“I certainly didn’t authorize this, Professor!” said

Percy, puffing himself up indignantly. “I was just

telling them all to get back to bed! My brother Ron

here had a nightmare — ”

“IT WASNT A NIGHTMARE!” Ron yelled.

“PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS

STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!”

Professor McGonagall stared at him.

“Don’t be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly

have gotten through the portrait hole?”

“Ask him!” said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the

back of Sir Cadogan’s picture. “Ask him if he saw — ”

Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall

pushed the portrait back open and went outside. The

whole common room listened with bated breath.

“Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor

Tower?”

 

“Certainly, good lady!” cried Sir Cadogan.

There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside

the common room.

“You — you did?” said Professor McGonagall. “But —

but the password!”

“He had ’em!” said Sir Cadogan proudly. “Had the

whole week’s, my lady! Read ’em off a little piece of

paper!”

Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the

portrait hole to face the stunned crowd. She was

white as chalk.

“Which person,” she said, her voice shaking, “which

abysmally foolish person wrote down this week’s

passwords and left them lying around?”

There was utter silence, broken by the smallest of

terrified squeaks. Neville Longbottom, trembling from

head to fluffy-slippered toes, raised his hand slowly

into the air.

 

SNAPE’S GRUDGE

No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They

knew that the castle was being searched again, and

the whole House stayed awake in the common room,

waiting to hear whether Black had been caught.

Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell

them that he had again escaped.

Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw

signs of tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be

seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large

picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling

up and down the corridors, boarding up everything

from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir

Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken

back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and

the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly

restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had

agreed to return to her job only on condition that she

was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security

trolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the

corridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and

comparing the size of their clubs.

 

Harry couldn’t help noticing that the statue of the

one-eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded

and unblocked. It seemed that Fred and George had

been right in thinking that they — and now Harry,

Ron, and Hermione — were the only ones who knew

about the hidden passageway within it.

“D’you reckon we should tell someone?” Harry asked

Ron.

“We know he’s not coming in through Honey duke’s,”

said Ron dismissively “We’d’ve heard if the shop had

been broken into.”

Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed

witch was boarded up too, he would never be able to

go into Hogsmeade again.

Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first

time in his life, people were paying more attention to

him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was

rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely

shaken by the night’s events, he was happy to tell

anyone who asked what had happened, with a wealth

of detail.

"... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I

thought it was in my dream, you know? But then

there was this draft ... I woke up and one side of the

hangings on my bed had been pulled down. ... I rolled

over . . . and I saw him standing over me . . . like a

skeleton, with loads of filthy hair . . . holding this great

long knife, must’ve been twelve inches ... and he

looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled,

and he scampered.

“Why, though?” Ron added to Harry as the group of

second-year girls who had been listening to his

chilling tale departed. “Why did he run?”

 

Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had

Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced Ron

and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved twelve

years ago that he didn’t mind murdering innocent

people, and this time he had been facing five

unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.

“He must’ve known he’d have a job getting back out of

the castle once you’d yelled and woken people up,”

said Harry thoughtfully. “He’d’ve had to kill the whole

House to get back through the portrait hole . . . then

he would’ve met the teachers. ...”

Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall

was so furious with him she had banned him from all

future Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and

forbidden anyone to give him the password into the

tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the

common room every night for somebody to let him in,

while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him.

None of these punishments, however, came close to

matching the one his grandmother had in store for

him. Two days after Black’s break-in, she sent Neville

the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive

over breakfast — a Howler.

The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying

the mail as usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn

owl landed in front of him, a scarlet envelope clutched

in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite

him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once — Ron

had got one from his mother the year before.

“Run for it, Neville,” Ron advised.

Neville didn’t need telling twice. He seized the

envelope, and holding it before him like a bomb,

sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table

exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They

 

heard the Howler go off in the entrance hall —

Neville’s grandmother’s voice, magically magnified to

a hundred times its usual volume, shrieking about

how he had brought shame on the whole family.

Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice

immediately that he had a letter too. Hedwig got his

attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist.

“Ouch! Oh — thanks, Hedwig.”

Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped

herself to some of Neville’s cornflakes. The note inside

said:

Dear Harry and Ron,

How about having tea with me this afternoon ’round

six?

I’ll come and collect you from the castle.

WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL;

YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN

Cheers,

Hagrid

“He probably wants to hear all about Black!” said

Ron.

So at six o’clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left

Gryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls at a run,

and headed down to the entrance hall.

Hagrid was already waiting for them.

 

“All right, Hagrid!” said Ron. “S’pose you want to hear

about Saturday night, do you?”

“I’ve already heard all abou’ it,” said Hagrid, opening

the front doors and leading them outside.

“Oh,” said Ron, looking slightly put out.

The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid’s cabin

was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of

Hagrid’s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded

tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead

ferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight,

Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very

horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of

Hagrid’s wardrobe door.

“What are they for, Hagrid?” said Harry.

“Buckbeak’s case against the Committee fer the

Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures,” said Hagrid. “This

Friday. Him an’ me’ll be goin’ down ter London

together. I’ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus. ...”

Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely

forgotten that Buckbeak’s trial was so near, and

judging by the uneasy look on Ron’s face, he had too.

They had also forgotten their promise about helping

him prepare Buckbeak’s defense; the arrival of the

Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds.

Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of

Bath buns, but they knew better than to accept; they

had had too much experience with Hagrid’s cooking.

“I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two,” said

Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking

uncharacteristically serious.

 

“What?” said Harry.

“Hermione,” said Hagrid.

“What about her?” said Ron.

“She’s in a righ’ state, that’s what. She’s bin cornin’

down ter visit me a lot since Chris ’mas. Bin feelin’

lonely. Firs’ yeh weren’ talking to her because o’ the

Firebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her because her cat — ”

“ — ate Scabbers!” Ron interjected angrily.

“Because her cat acted like all cats do,” Hagrid

continued doggedly. “She’s cried a fair few times, yeh

know. Goin’ through a rough time at the moment.

Bitten off more’n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the

work she’s tryin’ ter do. Still found time ter help me

with Buckbeak’s case, mind. ... She’s found some

really good stuff fer me ... reckon he’ll stand a good

chance now. ...”

“Hagrid, we should’ve helped as well — sorry — ”

Harry began awkwardly.

“I’m not blamin’ yeh!” said Hagrid, waving Harry’s

apology aside. “Gawd knows yeh’ve had enough ter be

gettin’ on with. I’ve seen yeh practicin’ Quidditch ev’ry

hour o’ the day an’ night — but I gotta tell yeh, I

thought you two’d value yer friend more’n

broomsticks or rats. Tha’s all.”

Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.

“Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed

yeh, Ron. She’s got her heart in the right place,

Hermione has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her — ”

 

“If she’d just get rid of that cat, I’d speak to her

again!” Ron said angrily. “But she’s still sticking up

for it! It’s a maniac, and she won’t hear a word

against it!”

“Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou’ their pets,”

said Hagrid wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few

ferret bones onto Hagrid’s pillow.

They spent the rest of their visit discussing

Gryffindor’s improved chances for the Quidditch Cup.

At nine o’clock, Hagrid walked them back up to the

castle.

A large group of people was bunched around the

bulletin board when they returned to the common

room.

“Hogsmeade, next weekend!” said Ron, craning over

the heads to read the new notice. “What d’you

reckon?” he added quietly to Harry as they went to sit

down.

“Well, Filch hasn’t done anything about the passage

into Honeydukes. ...” Harry said, even more quietly.

“Harry!” said a voice in his right ear. Harry started

and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at

the table right behind them and clearing a space in

the wall of books that had been hiding her.

“Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again ... I’ll tell

Professor McGonagall about that map!” said

Hermione.

“Can you hear someone talking, Harry?” growled Ron,

not looking at Hermione.

 

“Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what

Sirius Black nearly did to youl I mean it, I’ll tell — ”

“So now you’re trying to get Harry expelled!” said Ron

furiously. “Haven’t you done enough damage this

year?”

Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a

soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione

took one frightened look at the expression on Ron’s

face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away

toward the girls’ dormitories.

“So how about it?” Ron said to Harry as though there

had been no interruption. “Come on, last time we

went you didn’t see anything. You haven’t even been

inside Zonko’s yet!”

Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well

out of earshot.

“Okay,” he said. “But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak

this time.”

On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility

Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder’s Map into his

pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone

else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down

the table at him, but he avoided her eye and was

careful to let her see him walking back up the marble

staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else

proceeded to the front doors.

“ ’Bye!” Harry called to Ron. “See you when you get

back!”

Ron grinned and winked.

 

Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the

Marauder’s Map out of his pocket as he went.

Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it

out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry

squinted at it. The minuscule writing next to it read

Neville Longbottom.

Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered,

“ Dissendium).” and shoved his bag into the statue, but

before he could climb in himself, Neville came around

the corner.

“Harry! I forgot you weren’t going to Hogsmeade

either!”

“Hi, Neville,” said Harry, moving swiftly away from the

statue and pushing the map back into his pocket.

“What are you up to?”

“Nothing,” shrugged Neville. “Want a game of

Exploding Snap?”

“Er — not now — I was going to go to the library and

do that vampire essay for Lupin — ”

“I’ll come with you!” said Neville brightly. “I haven’t

done it either!”

“Er — hang on — yeah, I forgot, I finished it last

night!”

“Great, you can help me!” said Neville, his round face

anxious. “I don’t understand that thing about the

garlic at all — do they have to eat it, or — ”

He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry’s

shoulder.

It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.

 

“And what are you two doing here?” said Snape,

coming to a halt and looking from one to the other.

“An odd place to meet — ”

To Harry’s immense disquiet, Snape’s black eyes

flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and

then to the one-eyed witch.

“We’re not — meeting here,” said Harry. “We just —

met here.”

“Indeed?” said Snape. “You have a habit of turning up

in unexpected places, Potter, and you are very rarely

there for no good reason. ... I suggest the pair of you

return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.”

Harry and Neville set off without another word. As

they turned the corner, Harry looked back. Snape was

running one of his hands over the one-eyed witch’s

head, examining it closely.

Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by

telling him the password, then pretending he’d left his

vampire essay in the library and doubling back. Once

out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled out the

map again and held it close to his nose.

The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry

scanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of

relief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus Snape was

now back in its office.

He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her

hump, heaved himself inside, and slid down to meet

his bag at the bottom of the stone chute. He wiped

the Marauder’s Map blank again, then set off at a

run.

 

Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility

Cloak, emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes

and prodded Ron in the back.

“It’s me,” he muttered.

“What kept you?” Ron hissed.

“Snape was hanging around. ...”

They set off up the High Street.

“Where are you?” Ron kept muttering out of the

corner of his mouth. “Are you still there? This feels

weird. ...”

They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be

checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that

Harry could have a good look around. The owls sat

hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of

them; from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops

owls (“Local Deliveries Only”), which were so small

they could have sat in the palm of Harry’s hand.

Then they visited Zonko’s, which was so packed with

students Harry had to exercise great care not to tread

on anyone and cause a panic. There were jokes and

tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s wildest

dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed

him some gold from under the cloak. They left

Zonko’s with their money bags considerably lighter

than they had been on entering, but their pockets

bulging with Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn

Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece.

The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt

like staying indoors, so they walked past the Three

Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the

Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in

 

Britain. It stood a little way above the rest of the

village, and even in daylight was slightly creepy, with

its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.

“Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,” said Ron as they

leaned on the fence, looking up at it. “I asked Nearly

Headless Nick ... he says he’s heard a very rough

crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George

tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut.

Harry, feeling hot from their climb, was just

considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes

when they heard voices nearby. Someone was

climbing toward the house from the other side of the

hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed

closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was speaking.

"... should have an owl from Father any time now. He

had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm . . .

about how I couldn’t use it for three months. ...”

Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.

“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron

trying to defend himself ... There’s no ’arm in ’im,

’onest — ’ . . . that hippogriff’s as good as dead — ”

Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face

split in a malevolent grin.

“What are you doing, Weasley?”

Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.

“Suppose you’d love to live here, wouldn’t you,

Weasley? Dreaming about having your own bedroom?

I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that

true?”

 

Harry seized the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from

leaping on Malfoy.

“Leave him to me,” he hissed in Ron’s ear.

The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept

silently around behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,

bent down, and scooped a large handful of mud out of

the path.

“We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,” Malfoy

said to Ron. “Just trying to imagine what he’s saying

to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous

Creatures. D’you think he’ll cry when they cut off his

hippogriff’s — ”

SPLAT.

Malfoy’s head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his

silver-blond hair was suddenly dripping in muck.

“What the — ?”

Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself

standing, he was laughing so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe,

and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly

around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.

“What was that? Who did that?”

“Very haunted up here, isn’t it?” said Ron, with the

air of one commenting on the weather.

Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging

muscles were no use against ghosts. Malfoy was

staring madly around at the deserted landscape.

 

Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly

sloppy puddle yielded some foul-smelling, green

sludge.

SPLATTER.

Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle

hopped furiously on the spot, trying to rub it out of

his small, dull eyes.

“It came from over there!” said Malfoy, wiping his

face, and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of

Harry.

Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms

outstretched like a zombie. Harry dodged around him,

picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe ’s back.

Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a

kind of pirouette in midair, trying to see who had

thrown it. As Ron was the only person Crabbe could

see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry stuck

out his leg. Crabbe stumbled — and his huge, flat foot

caught the hem of Harry’s cloak. Harry felt a great

tug, then the cloak slid off his face.

For a split second, Malfoy stared at him.

“AAARGH!” he yelled, pointing at Harry’s head. Then

he turned tail and ran, at breakneck speed, back

down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind him.

Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was

done.

“Harry!” Ron said, stumbling forward and staring

hopelessly at the point where Harry had disappeared,

“you’d better run for it! If Malfoy tells anyone — you’d

better get back to the castle, quick — ”

 

“See you later,” said Harry, and without another

word, he tore back down the path toward Hogsmeade.

Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would

anyone believe Malfoy? Nobody knew about the

Invisibility Cloak — nobody except Dumbledore.

Harry’s stomach turned over — Dumbledore would

know exactly what had happened, if Malfoy said

anything —

Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps,

across the stone floor, through the trapdoor — Harry

pulled off the cloak, tucked it under his arm, and ran,

flat out, along the passage. ... Malfoy would get back

first . . . how long would it take him to find a teacher?

Panting, a sharp pain in his side, Harry didn’t slow

down until he reached the stone slide. He would have

to leave the cloak where it was, it was too much of a

giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher — he

hid it in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast

as he could, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of

the chute. He reached the inside of the witch’s hump,

tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through, and

hoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as

Harry jumped out from behind the statue, he heard

quick footsteps approaching.

It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk,

his black robes swishing, then stopped in front of

him.

“So,” he said.

There was a look of suppressed triumph about him.

Harry tried to look innocent, all too aware of his

sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he quickly

hid in his pockets.

“Come with me, Potter,” said Snape.

 

Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his

hands clean on the inside of his robes without Snape

noticing. They walked down the stairs to the

dungeons and then into Snape’s office.

Harry had been in here only once before, and he had

been in very serious trouble then too. Snape had

acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars

since last time, all standing on shelves behind his

desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the

threatening atmosphere.

“Sit,” said Snape.

Harry sat. Snape, however, remained standing.

“Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange

story, Potter,” said Snape.

Harry didn’t say anything.

“He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack

when he ran into Weasley — apparently alone.”

Still, Harry didn’t speak.

“Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to

Weasley, when a large amount of mud hit him in the

back of the head. How do you think that could have

happened?”

Harry tried to look mildly surprised.

“I don’t know, Professor.”

Snape’s eyes were boring into Harry’s. It was exactly

like trying to stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard

not to blink.

 

“Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition.

Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?”

“No,” said Harry, now trying to sound innocently

curious.

“It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.”

There was a long silence.

“Maybe he’d better go to Madam Pomfrey,” said Harry.

“If he’s seeing things like — ”

“What would your head have been doing in

Hogsmeade, Potter?” said Snape softly. “Your head is

not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has

permission to be in Hogsmeade.”

“I know that,” said Harry, striving to keep his face free

of guilt or fear. “It sounds like Malfoy’s having

hallucin — ”

“Malfoy is not having hallucinations,” snarled Snape,

and he bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry’s

chair, so that their faces were a foot apart. “If your

head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.”

“I’ve been up in Gryffindor Tower,” said Harry. “Like

you told — ”

“Can anyone confirm that?”

Harry didn’t say anything. Snape’s thin mouth curled

into a horrible smile.

“So,” he said, straightening up again. “Everyone from

the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to

keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But

famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself. Let the

 

ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry

Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for

the consequences.”

Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him

into telling the truth. He wasn’t going to do it. Snape

had no proof — yet.

“How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,”

Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. “He too was

exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the

Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above

the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his

friends and admirers . . . The resemblance between you

is uncanny.”

“My dad didn’t strut,” said Harry, before he could stop

himself. “And neither do I.”

“Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,”

Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face

full of malice. “Rules were for lesser mortals, not

Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen — ”

“SHUT UP!”

Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had

not felt since his last night in Privet Drive was

coursing through him. He didn’t care that Snape’s

face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing

dangerously.

“ What did you say to me, Potter?”

“I told you to shut up about my dad!” Harry yelled. “I

know the truth, all right? He saved your life!

Dumbledore told me! You wouldn’t even be here if it

wasn’t for my dad!”

 

Snape’s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.

“And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances

in which your father saved my life?” he whispered.

“Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for

precious Potter’s delicate ears?”

Harry bit his lip. He didn’t know what had happened

and didn’t want to admit it — but Snape seemed to

have guessed the truth.

“I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of

your father, Potter,” he said, a terrible grin twisting

his face. “Have you been imagining some act of

glorious heroism? Then let me correct you — your

saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing

joke on me that would have resulted in my death if

your father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment.

There was nothing brave about what he did. He was

saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke

succeeded, he would have been expelled from

Hogwarts.”

Snape’s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.

“Turn out your pockets, Potter!” he spat suddenly.

Harry didn’t move. There was a pounding in his ears.

“Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the

headmaster! Pull them out, Potter!”

Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of

Zonko’s tricks and the Marauder’s Map.

Snape picked up the Zonko’s bag.

 

“Ron gave them to me,” said Harry, praying he’d get a

chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him. “He —

brought them back from Hogsmeade last time — ”

“Indeed? And you’ve been carrying them around ever

since? How very touching . . . and what is this?”

Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his

might to keep his face impassive.

“Spare bit of parchment,” he said with a shrug.

Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.

“Surely you don’t need such a very old piece of

parchment?” he said. “Why don’t I just — throw this

away?”

His hand moved toward the fire.

“No!” Harry said quickly.

“So!” said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. “Is this

another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it —

something else? A letter, perhaps, written in invisible

ink? Or — instructions to get into Hogsmeade without

passing the dementors?”

Harry blinked. Snape ’s eyes gleamed.

“Let me see, let me see ... ,” he muttered, taking out

his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk.

“Reveal your secret!” he said, touching the wand to

the parchment.

Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop

them from shaking.

 

“Show yourself!” Snape said, tapping the map

sharply.

It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming

breaths.

“Professor Severus Snape, master of this school,

commands you to yield the information you conceal!”

Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.

As though an invisible hand were writing upon it,

words appeared on the smooth surface of the map.

“Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor

Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large

nose out of other people’s business.”

Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the

message. But the map didn’t stop there. More writing

was appearing beneath the first.

“Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to

add that Professor Snape is an ugly git.”

It would have been very funny if the situation hadn’t

been so serious. And there was more. ...

“Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment

that an idiot like that ever became a professor.”

Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he’d opened

them, the map had had its last word.

“Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and

advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball.”

Harry waited for the blow to fall.

“So ... ,” said Snape softly. “We’ll see about this. ...”

 

He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of

glittering powder from ajar on the fireplace, and

threw it into the flames.

“Lupin!” Snape called into the fire. “I want a word!”

Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large

shape had appeared in it, revolving very fast. Seconds

later, Professor Lupin was clambering out of the

fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.

“You called, Severus?” said Lupin mildly.

“I certainly did,” said Snape, his face contorted with

fury as he strode back to his desk. “I have just asked

Potter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this.”

Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words

of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs

were still shining. An odd, closed expression appeared

on Lupin’s face.

“Well?” said Snape.

Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the

impression that Lupin was doing some very quick

thinking.

“Well?” said Snape again. “This parchment is plainly

full of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be your area of

expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got

such a thing?”

Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in

Harry’s direction, warned him not to interrupt.

“Full of Dark Magic?” he repeated mildly. “Do you

really think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is

merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who

 

reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I

imagine Harry got it from a joke shop — ”

“Indeed?” said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with

anger. “You think a joke shop could supply him with

such a thing? You don’t think it more likely that he

got it directly from the manufacturers?”

Harry didn’t understand what Snape was talking

about. Nor, apparently, did Lupin.

“You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?”

he said. “Harry, do you know any of these men?”

“No,” said Harry quickly.

“You see, Severus?” said Lupin, turning back to

Snape. “It looks like a Zonko product to me — ”

Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He

was completely out of breath, and stopped just short

of Snape ’s desk, clutching the stitch in his chest and

trying to speak.

“I — gave — Harry — that — stuff,” he choked.

“Bought — it ... in Zonko ’s ... ages — ago ...”

“Well!” said Lupin, clapping his hands together and

looking around cheerfully. “That seems to clear that

up! Severus, I’ll take this back, shall I?” He folded the

map and tucked it inside his robes. “Harry, Ron,

come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay

— excuse us, Severus — ”

Harry didn’t dare look at Snape as they left his office.

He, Ron, and Lupin walked all the way back into the

entrance hall before speaking. Then Harry turned to

Lupin.

 

“Professor, I — ”

“I don’t want to hear explanations,” said Lupin

shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall

and lowered his voice. “I happen to know that this

map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago.

Yes, I know it’s a map,” he said as Harry and Ron

looked amazed. “I don’t want to know how it fell into

your possession. I am, however, astounded that you

didn’t hand it in. Particularly after what happened the

last time a student left information about the castle

lying around. And I can’t let you have it back, Harry.”

Harry had expected that, and was too keen for

explanations to protest.

“Why did Snape think I’d got it from the

manufacturers?”

“Because ... ,” Lupin hesitated, “because these

mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of

school. They’d think it extremely entertaining.”

“Do you know them?” said Harry, impressed.

“We’ve met,” he said shortly. He was looking at Harry

more seriously than ever before.

“Don’t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I

cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I

would have thought that what you have heard when

the dementors draw near you would have had more of

an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep

you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them —

gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.”

He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far

than he had at any point in Snape ’s office. Slowly, he

and Ron mounted the marble staircase. As Harry

 

passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the

Invisibility Cloak — it was still down there, but he

didn’t dare go and get it.

“It’s my fault,” said Ron abruptly. “I persuaded you to

go. Lupin’s right, it was stupid, we shouldn’t’ve done

it — ”

He broke off; they reached the corridor where the

security trolls were pacing, and Hermione was

walking toward them. One look at her face convinced

Harry that she had heard what had happened. His

heart plummeted — had she told Professor

McGonagall?

“Come to have a good gloat?” said Ron savagely as

she stopped in front of them. “Or have you just been

to tell on us?”

“No,” said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her

hands and her lip was trembling. “I just thought you

ought to know ... Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is

going to be executed.”

 

THE QUIDDITCH FINAL

“He — he sent me this,” Hermione said, holding out

the letter.

Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and

enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in

places that it was very difficult to read.

Dear Hermione,

We lost I’m allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts.

Execution date to be fixed.

Beaky has enjoyed London.

I won’t forget all the help you gave us.

Hagrid

“They can’t do this,” said Harry. “They can’t.

Buckbeak isn’t dangerous.”

 

“Malfoy’s dad’s frightened the Committee into it,” said

Hermione, wiping her eyes. “You know what he’s like.

They’re a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were

scared. There’ll be an appeal, though, there always is.

Only I can’t see any hope. ... Nothing will have

changed.”

“Yeah, it will,” said Ron fiercely. “You won’t have to do

all the work alone this time, Hermione. I’ll help.”

“Oh, Ron!”

Hermione flung her arms around Ron’s neck and

broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified,

patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head.

Finally, Hermione drew away.

“Ron, I’m really, really sorry about Scabbers ... ,” she

sobbed.

“Oh — well — he was old,” said Ron, looking

thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him. “And

he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad

might get me an owl now.”

The safety measures imposed on the students since

Black’s second break-in made it impossible for Harry,

Ron, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the

evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was

during Care of Magical Creatures lessons.

He seemed numb with shock at the verdict.

“S’all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin’

there in black robes an’ I kep’ droppin’ me notes and

forgettin’ all them dates yeh looked up fer me,

Hermione. An’ then Lucius Malfoy stood up an’ said

his bit, and the Committee jus’ did exac’ly what he

told ’em. ...”

 

“There’s still the appeal!” said Ron fiercely. “Don’t give

up yet, we’re working on it!”

They were walking back up to the castle with the rest

of the class. Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was

walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking

back, laughing derisively.

“S’no good, Ron,” said Hagrid sadly as they reached

the castle steps. “That Committee’s in Lucius Malfoy ’s

pocket. I’m jus’ gonna make sure the rest o’ Beaky’s

time is the happiest he’s ever had. I owe him that. ...”

Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his

cabin, his face buried in his handkerchief.

“Look at him blubber!”

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just

inside the castle doors, listening.

“Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” said

Malfoy. “And he’s supposed to be our teacher!”

Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward

Malfoy, but Hermione got there first — SMACK!

She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the

strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry,

Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as

Hermione raised her hand again.

“Don’t you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you

evil — ”

“Hermione!” said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her

hand as she swung it back.

“Get off, Ron!”

 

Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped

backward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for

instructions, thoroughly bewildered.

“C’mon,” Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three

of them had disappeared into the passageway to the

dungeons.

“Hermionel” Ron said again, sounding both stunned

and impressed.

“Harry, you’d better beat him in the Quidditch final!”

Hermione said shrilly. “You just better had, because I

can’t stand it if Slytherin wins!”

“We’re due in Charms,” said Ron, still goggling at

Hermione. “We’d better go.”

They hurried up the marble staircase toward

Professor Flitwick’s classroom.

“You’re late, boys!” said Professor Flitwick reprovingly

as Harry opened the classroom door. “Come along,

quickly, wands out, we’re experimenting with

Cheering Charms today, we’ve already divided into

pairs — ”

Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and

opened their bags. Ron looked behind him.

“Where’s Hermione gone?”

Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn’t entered

the classroom, yet Harry knew she had been right

next to him when he had opened the door.

“That’s weird,” said Harry, staring at Ron. “Maybe —

maybe she went to the bathroom or something?”

 

But Hermione didn’t turn up all lesson.

“She could’ve done with a Cheering Charm on her

too,” said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning

broadly — the Cheering Charms had left them with a

feeling of great contentment.

Hermione wasn’t at lunch either. By the time they

had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the

Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and

Ron had started to get slightly worried.

“You don’t think Malfoy did something to her?” Ron

said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward

Gryffindor Tower.

They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the

password (“Flibbertigibbet”), and scrambled through

the portrait hole into the common room.

Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head

resting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit

down on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake.

“Wh — what?” said Hermione, waking with a start

and staring wildly around. “Is it time to go? W —

which lesson have we got now?

“Divination, but it’s not for another twenty minutes,”

said Harry. “Hermione, why didn’t you come to

Charms?”

“What? Oh no!” Hermione squeaked. “I forgot to go to

Charms!”

“But how could you forget?” said Harry. “You were

with us till we were right outside the classroom!”

 

“I don’t believe it!” Hermione wailed. “Was Professor

Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking

about him and I lost track of things!”

“You know what, Hermione?” said Ron, looking down

at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had

been using as a pillow. “I reckon you’re cracking up.

You’re trying to do too much.”

“No, I’m not!” said Hermione, brushing her hair out of

her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. “I

just made a mistake, that’s all! I’d better go and see

Professor Flitwick and say sorry. ... I’ll see you in

Divination!”

Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to

Professor Trelawney’s classroom twenty minutes later,

looking extremely harassed.

“I can’t believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet

they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted

they might!”

Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling

tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal

ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and

Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table.

“I thought we weren’t starting crystal balls until next

term,” Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for

Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby.

“Don’t complain, this means we’ve finished

palmistry,” Harry muttered back. “I was getting sick

of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.”

“Good day to you!” said the familiar, misty voice, and

Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic

entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender

 

quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky

glow of their crystal ball.

“I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little

earlier than I had planned,” said Professor Trelawney,

sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around.

“The fates have informed me that your examination in

June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give

you sufficient practice.”

Hermione snorted.

“Well, honestly ... ‘the fates have informed her’ ... who

sets the exam? She does! What an amazing

prediction!” she said, not troubling to keep her voice

low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.

It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had

heard them, as her face was hidden in shadow. She

continued, however, as though she had not.

“Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,” she said

dreamily. “I do not expect any of you to See when first

you peer into the Orb’s infinite depths. We shall start

by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and

external eyes” — Ron began to snigger uncontrollably

and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the

noise — “so as to clear the Inner Eye and the

superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you

will See before the end of the class.”

And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely

foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to

keep his mind empty when thoughts such as “this is

stupid” kept drifting across it. It didn’t help that Ron

kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept

tutting.

 

“Seen anything yet?” Harry asked them after a

quarter of an hour’s quiet crystal gazing.

“Yeah, there’s a burn on this table,” said Ron,

pointing. “Someone’s spilled their candle.”

“This is such a waste of time,” Hermione hissed. “I

could be practicing something useful. I could be

catching up on Cheering Charms — ”

Professor Trelawney rustled past.

“Would anyone like me to help them interpret the

shadowy portents within their Orb?” she murmured

over the clinking of her bangles.

“I don’t need help,” Ron whispered. “It’s obvious what

this means. There’s going to be loads of fog tonight.”

Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.

“Now, really!” said Professor Trelawney as everyone’s

heads turned in their direction. Parvati and Lavender

were looking scandalized. “You are disturbing the

clairvoyant vibrations!” She approached their table

and peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart

sinking. He was sure he knew what was coming —

“There is something here!” Professor Trelawney

whispered, lowering her face to the ball, so that it was

reflected twice in her huge glasses. “Something

moving . . . but what is it?”

Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned,

including his Firebolt, that it wasn’t good news,

whatever it was. And sure enough —

“My dear ... ,” Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing

up at Harry. “It is here, plainer than ever before ... my

 

dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer ... the

Gr — ”

“Oh, for goodness’ sake!” said Hermione loudly. “Not

that ridiculous Grim again\”

Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to

Hermione ’s face. Parvati whispered something to

Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too.

Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione

with unmistakable anger.

“I am sorry to say that from the moment you have

arrived in this class, my dear, it has been apparent

that you do not have what the noble art of Divination

requires. Indeed, I don’t remember ever meeting a

student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.”

There was a moment’s silence. Then —

“Fine!” said Hermione suddenly, getting up and

cramming Unfogging the Future back into her bag.

“Fine!” she repeated, swinging the bag over her

shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. “I

give up! I’m leaving!”

And to the whole class’s amazement, Hermione strode

over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed

down the ladder out of sight.

It took a few minutes for the class to settle down

again. Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten

all about the Grim. She turned abruptly from Harry

and Ron’s table, breathing rather heavily as she

tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.

“Ooooo!” said Lavender suddenly, making everyone

start. “Oooooo, Professor Trelawney, I’ve just

remembered! You saw her leaving, didn’t you? Didn’t

 

you, Professor? ‘Around Easter, one of our number will

leave us forever*.’ You said it ages ago, Professor!”

Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile.

“Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger

would be leaving us. One hopes, however, that one

might have mistaken the Signs. ... The Inner Eye can

be a burden, you know. ...”

Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and

moved over so that Professor Trelawney could join

their table instead.

“Some day Hermione’s having, eh?” Ron muttered to

Harry, looking awed.

“Yeah ...”

Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing

but swirling white mist. Had Professor Trelawney

really seen the Grim again? Would he? The last thing

he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the

Quidditch final drawing ever nearer.

The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The

third years had never had so much homework. Neville

Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and

he wasn’t the only one.

“Call this a holiday!” Seamus Finnigan roared at the

common room one afternoon. “The exams are ages

away, what’re they playing at?”

But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even

without Divination, she was taking more subjects

than anybody else. She was usually last to leave the

common room at night, first to arrive at the library

 

the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin’s

under her eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears.

Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak’s

appeal. When he wasn’t doing his own work, he was

poring over enormously thick volumes with names

like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl

or Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so

absorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to

Crookshanks.

Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around

Quidditch practice every day, not to mention endless

discussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor-

Slytherin match would take place on the first

Saturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin was

leading the tournament by exactly two hundred

points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his

team) that they needed to win the match by more

than that amount to win the Cup. It also meant that

the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because

capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty

points.

“So you must catch it only if we’re more than fifty

points up,” Wood told Harry constantly. “Only if we’re

more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match

but lose the Cup. You’ve got that, haven’t you? You

must catch the Snitch only if we’re — ”

“I KNOW, OLIVER!” Harry yelled.

The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the

coming match. Gryffindor hadn’t won the Quidditch

Cup since the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron’s

second oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry

doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to

win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry

and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was

 

still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in

Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry

had somehow wormed his way out of punishment.

Harry hadn’t forgotten Malfoy’s attempt to sabotage

him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the

matter of Buckbeak that made him most determined

to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.

Never, in anyone’s memory, had a match approached

in such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the

holidays were over, tension between the two teams

and their Houses was at the breaking point. A

number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors,

culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor

fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the

hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.

Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He

couldn’t walk to class without Slytherins sticking out

their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle

kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching

away looking disappointed when they saw him

surrounded by people. Wood had given instructions

that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he

went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of

action. The whole of Gryffindor House took up the

challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible

for Harry to get to classes on time because he was

surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was

more concerned for his Firebolt’s safety than his own.

When he wasn’t flying it, he locked it securely in his

trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor

Tower at break times to check that it was still there.

All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor

common room the night before the match. Even

Hermione had put down her books.

“I can’t work, I can’t concentrate,” she said nervously.

 

There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George

Weasley were dealing with the pressure by being

louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver Wood

was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the

corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand

and muttering to himself. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie

were laughing at Fred’s and George’s jokes. Harry was

sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the

center of things, trying not to think about the next

day, because every time he did, he had the horrible

sensation that something very large was fighting to

get out of his stomach.

“You’re going to be fine,” Hermione told him, though

she looked positively terrified.

“You’ve got a Firebolti” said Ron.

“Yeah ... ,” said Harry, his stomach writhing.

It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and

yelled, “Team! Bed!”

Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had

overslept, and that Wood was yelling, “Where were

you? We had to use Neville instead!” Then he dreamed

that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived

for the match riding dragons. He was flying at

breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames

from Malfoy ’s steed’s mouth, when he realized he had

forgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and

woke with a start.

It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that

the match hadn’t taken place yet, that he was safe in

bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn’t

be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very

 

thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-

poster and went to pour himself some water from the

silver jug beneath the window.

The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind

disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the

Whomping Willow was motionless and innocent-

looking. It looked as though the conditions for the

match would be perfect.

Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back

to his bed when something caught his eye. An animal

of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn.

Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his

glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the

window. It couldn’t be the Grim — not now — not

right before the match —

He peered out at the grounds again and, after a

minute’s frantic searching, spotted it. It was skirting

the edge of the forest now. ... It wasn’t the Grim at all

...it was a cat. ... Harry clutched the window ledge in

relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only

Crookshanks. ...

Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted,

pressing his nose flat against the glass. Crookshanks

seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure he

could see something else moving in the shadow of the

trees too.

And just then, it emerged — a gigantic, shaggy black

dog, moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks

trotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean?

If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it

be an omen of Harry’s death?

“Ron!” Harry hissed. “Ron! Wake up!”

 

“Huh?”

“I need you to tell me if you can see something!”

“S’all dark, Harry,” Ron muttered thickly. “What’re

you on about?”

“Down here — ”

Harry looked quickly back out of the window.

Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry

climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into

the shadows of the castle, but they weren’t there.

Where had they gone?

A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.

Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the

Great Hall the next day to enormous applause. Harry

couldn’t help grinning broadly as he saw that both

the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding

them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they

passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler

than usual.

Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to

eat, while touching nothing himself. Then he hurried

them off to the field before anyone else had finished,

so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they

left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again.

“Good luck, Harry!” called Cho. Harry felt himself

blushing.

“Okay — no wind to speak of — sun’s a bit bright,

that could impair your vision, watch out for it —

ground’s fairly hard, good, that’ll give us a fast kickoff

??

 

Wood paced the field, staring around with the team

behind him. Finally, they saw the front doors of the

castle open in the distance and the rest of the school

spilling onto the lawn.

“Locker rooms,” said Wood tersely.

None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet

robes. Harry wondered if they were feeling like he

was: as though he’d eaten something extremely

wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at

all, Wood was saying, “Okay, it’s time, let’s go — ”

They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise.

Three-quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet

rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion

upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like

“GO GRYFFINDOR!” and “LIONS FOR THE CUP!”

Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two

hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent

of Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor

Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like

everyone else, and a very grim smile.

“And here are the Gryffindors!” yelled Lee Jordan,

who was acting as commentator as usual. “Potter,

Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood.

Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has

seen in a good few years — ”

Lee’s comments were drowned by a tide of “boos” from

the Slytherin end.

“And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain

Flint. He’s made some changes in the lineup and

seems to be going for size rather than skill — ”

More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however,

thought Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily the

 

smallest person on the Slytherin team; the rest of

them were enormous.

“Captains, shake hands!” said Madam Hooch.

Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped

each other’s hand very tightly; it looked as though

each was trying to break the other’s fingers.

“Mount your brooms!” said Madam Hooch. “Three ...

two ... one ...”

The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the

crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Harry felt

his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him

in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw

Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the

Snitch.

“And it’s Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of

Gryffindor with the Quaffle, heading straight for the

Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no —

Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington of

Slytherin tearing up the field — WHAM! — nice

Bludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington

drops the Quaffle, it’s caught by — Johnson,

Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina —

nice swerve around Montague — duck, Angelina,

that’s a Bludger] — SHE SCORES! TEN-ZERO TO

GRYFFINDOR!”

Angelina punched the air as she soared around the

end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was

screaming its delight —

“OUCH!”

Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as

Marcus Flint went smashing into her.

 

“Sorry!” said Flint as the crowd below booed. “Sorry,

didn’t see her!”

A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater’s

club at the back of Flint’s head. Flint’s nose smashed

into the handle of his broom and began to bleed.

“That will do!” shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming

between them. “Penalty shot to Gryffindor for an

unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty shot to

Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!”

“Come off it, Miss!” howled Fred, but Madam Hooch

blew her whistle and Alicia flew forward to take the

penalty.

“Come on, Alicia!” yelled Lee into the silence that had

descended on the crowd. “YES! SHE’S BEATEN THE

KEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!”

Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still

bleeding freely, fly forward to take the Slytherin

penalty. Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor

goal posts, his jaw clenched.

“ ’Course, Wood’s a superb Keeper!” Lee Jordan told

the crowd as Flint waited for Madam Hooch’s whistle.

“Superb! Very difficult to pass — very difficult indeed

— YES! I DONT BELIEVE IT! HE’S SAVED IT!”

Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the

Snitch, but still making sure he caught every word of

Lee’s commentary. It was essential that he hold

Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than

fifty points up —

“Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession

— no! — Gryffindor back in possession and it’s Katie

 

Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she’s

streaking up the field — THAT WAS DELIBERATE!”

Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of

Katie, and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed

her head. Katie cartwheeled in the air, managed to

stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle.

Madam Hooch’s whistle rang out again as she soared

over to Montague and began shouting at him. A

minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the

Slytherin Seeker.

“THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING

“Jordan, if you can’t commentate in an unbiased way

— !”

“I’m telling it like it is, Professor!”

Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the

Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the

Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn’t catch it yet —

and if Malfoy saw it —

Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled

his Firebolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin

end — it worked. Malfoy went haring after him,

clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there. ...

WHOOSH.

One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry’s right

ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick.

Then again —

WHOOSH.

 

The second Bludger grazed Harry’s elbow. The other

Beater, Bole, was closing in.

Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick

zooming toward him, clubs raised —

He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and

Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch.

“Ha haaa!” yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters

lurched away from each other, clutching their heads.

“Too bad, boys! You’ll need to get up earlier than that

to beat a Firebolt! And it’s Gryffindor in possession

again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside

her — poke him in the eye, Angelina! — it was a joke,

Professor, it was a joke — oh no — Flint in

possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal

posts, come on now, Wood, save — !”

But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers

from the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that

Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical

megaphone away from him.

“Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won’t happen again! So,

Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and

Gryffindor in possession — ”

It was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever

played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an

early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any

means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his

club and tried to say he’d thought she was a Bludger.

George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in

retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams

penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular

save, making the score forty-ten to Gryffindor.

 

The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still

keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match,

looking around for it — once Gryffindor was fifty

points ahead —

Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were

swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the

Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick

took advantage of Fred’s and George’s absence to aim

both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the

stomach, one after the other, and he rolled over in the

air, clutching his broom, completely winded.

Madam Hooch was beside herself.

“YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE

QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING AREA!” she

shrieked at Bole and Derrick. “Gryffindor penalty!”

And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred

Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the

Quaffle out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it

through the Slytherin goal — seventy-ten.

The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself

hoarse — Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead, and

if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs.

Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following

him as he soared around the field, high above the rest

of the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him.

And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty

feet above him.

Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was

roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but

suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down —

 

Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown

himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt’s tail,

and was pulling it back.

“You — ”

Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn’t

reach — Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding

onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling

maliciously. He had achieved what he’d wanted to do

— the Snitch had disappeared again.

“Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I’ve never seen such

tactics!” Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to

where Malfoy was sliding back onto his Nimbus Two

Thousand and One.

“YOU CHEATING SCUM!” Lee Jordan was howling

into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor

McGonagall’s reach. “YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B — ”

Professor McGonagall didn’t even bother to tell him

off. She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoy’s

direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was

shouting furiously.

Alicia took Gryffindor’s penalty, but she was so angry

she missed by several feet. The Gryffindor team was

losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by

Malfoy’s foul on Harry, were being spurred on to

greater heights.

“Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal —

Montague scores — ” Lee groaned. “Seventy-twenty to

Gryffindor. ...”

Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees

kept hitting each other. Harry wasn’t going to let

Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch. ...

 

“Get out of it, Potter!” Malfoy yelled in frustration as

he tried to turn and found Harry blocking him.

“Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor,

come on, Angelina, COME ON!”

Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player

apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward

Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were

all going to block her —

Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he

was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward.

Like a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins.

“AAAAAAARRRGH ! ”

They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them;

Angelina’s way was clear.

“SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by

eighty points to twenty!”

Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the

stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and

zoomed back into the middle of the field.

And then he saw something to make his heart stand

still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face

— there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny,

golden glimmer —

Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was

miles ahead —

“Go! Go! Go!” Harry urged his broom. He was gaining

on Malfoy — Harry flattened himself to the broom

handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him — he was at

Malfoy’s ankles — he was level —

 

Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his

broom. He knocked Malfoy’s arm out of the way and

“YES!”

He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the

stadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an

odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held

tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against

his fingers.

Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by

tears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed

unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large

thumps as Fred and George hit them; then

Angelina’s, Alicia’s, and Katie’s voices, “We’ve won the

Cup\ We’ve won the Cup\” Tangled together in a

many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling

hoarsely, back to earth.

Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring

over the barriers onto the field. Hands were raining

down on their backs. Harry had a confused

impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him.

Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto

the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into the light, he

saw Hagrid, plastered with crimson rosettes — “Yeh

beat ’em, Harry, yeh beat ’em! Wait till I tell

Buckbeak!” There was Percy, jumping up and down

like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor

McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood,

wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag;

and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron

and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply

beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where

Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous

Quidditch Cup.

 

If only there had been a dementor around. ... As a

sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it

into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the

world’s best Patronus.

 

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S

PREDICTION

Harry’s euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup

lasted at least a week. Even the weather seemed to be

celebrating; as June approached, the days became

cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing

was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on

the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice,

perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or

watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across

the surface of the lake.

But they couldn’t. Exams were nearly upon them, and

instead of lazing around outside, the students were

forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their

brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of

summer air drifted in through the windows. Even

Fred and George Weasley had been spotted working;

they were about to take their O.W.L.s (Ordinary

Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his

N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the

highest qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy

 

hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top

grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave

very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed

the quiet of the common room in the evenings. In fact,

the only person who seemed more anxious than Percy

was Hermione.

Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was

managing to attend several classes at once, but they

couldn’t restrain themselves when they saw the exam

schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first

column read:

Monday

9 o’clock, Arithmancy

9 o’clock, Transfiguration

Lunch

1 o’clock, Charms

1 o’clock, Ancient Runes

“Hermione?” Ron said cautiously, because she was

liable to explode when interrupted these days. “Er —

are you sure you’ve copied down these times right?”

“What?” snapped Hermione, picking up the exam

schedule and examining it. “Yes, of course I have.”

“Is there any point asking how you’re going to sit for

two exams at once?” said Harry.

“No,” said Hermione shortly. “Have either of you seen

my copy of Numerology and Gramatica?”

 

“Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,”

said Ron, but very quietly. Hermione started shifting

heaps of parchment around on her table, looking for

the book. Just then, there was a rustle at the window

and Hedwig fluttered through it, a note clutched tight

in her beak.

“It’s from Hagrid,” said Harry, ripping the note open.

“Buckbeak’s appeal — it’s set for the sixth.”

“That’s the day we finish our exams,” said Hermione,

still looking everywhere for her Arithmancy book.

“And they’re coming up here to do it,” said Harry, still

reading from the letter. “Someone from the Ministry of

Magic and — and an executioner.”

Hermione looked up, startled.

“They’re bringing the executioner to the appeal! But

that sounds as though they’ve already decided!”

“Yeah, it does,” said Harry slowly.

“They can’t!” Ron howled. “I’ve spent ages reading up

on stuff for him; they can’t just ignore it all!”

But Harry had a horrible feeling that the Committee

for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had had its

mind made up for it by Mr. Malfoy. Draco, who had

been noticeably subdued since Gryffindor’s triumph

in the Quidditch final, seemed to regain some of his

old swagger over the next few days. From sneering

comments Harry overheard, Malfoy was certain

Buckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed

thoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about.

It was all Harry could do to stop himself imitating

Hermione and hitting Malfoy in the face on these

occasions. And the worst thing of all was that they

 

had no time or opportunity to go and see Hagrid,

because the strict new security measures had not

been lifted, and Harry didn’t dare retrieve his

Invisibility Cloak from below the one-eyed witch.

k k k

Exam week began and an unnatural hush fell over

the castle. The third years emerged from

Transfiguration at lunchtime on Monday, limp and

ashen-faced, comparing results and bemoaning the

difficulty of the tasks they had been set, which had

included turning a teapot into a tortoise. Hermione

irritated the rest by fussing about how her tortoise

had looked more like a turtle, which was the least of

everyone else’s worries.

“Mine still had a spout for a tail, what a nightmare.

“Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam?”

“It still had a willow-patterned shell, d’you think

that 11 count against me?”

Then, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back

upstairs for the Charms exam. Hermione had been

right; Professor Flitwick did indeed test them on

Cheering Charms. Harry slightly overdid his out of

nerves and Ron, who was partnering him, ended up

in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to

a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to

perform the charm himself. After dinner, the students

hurried back to their common rooms, not to relax,

but to start studying for Care of Magical Creatures,

Potions, and Astronomy.

 

Hagrid presided over the Care of Magical Creatures

exam the following morning with a very preoccupied

air indeed; his heart didn’t seem to be in it at all. He

had provided a large tub of fresh flobberworms for the

class, and told them that to pass the test, their

flobberworm had to still be alive at the end of one

hour. As flobberworms flourished best if left to their

own devices, it was the easiest exam any of them had

ever taken, and also gave Harry, Ron, and Hermione

plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid.

“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” Hagrid told them,

bending low on the pretense of checking that Harry’s

flobberworm was still alive. “Bin cooped up too long.

But still ... we’ll know day after tomorrow — one way

or the other — ”

They had Potions that afternoon, which was an

unqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he couldn’t

get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape,

standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure,

scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a

zero onto his notes before moving away.

Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest

tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in

which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue

had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while

wishing he could have had one of Fortescue ’s choco-

nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom.

Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the

greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to

the common room once more, with sunburnt necks,

thinking longingly of this time next day, when it

would all be over.

Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was

Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had

compiled the most unusual exam any of them had

 

ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the

sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling

pool containing a grindylow, cross a series of potholes

full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of

marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a

hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle

with a new boggart.

“Excellent, Harry,” Lupin muttered as Harry climbed

out of the trunk, grinning. “Full marks.”

Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to

watch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well until he

reached the hinkypunk, which successfully confused

him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire.

Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached

the trunk with the boggart in it. After about a minute

inside it, she burst out again, screaming.

“Hermione!” said Lupin, startled. “What’s the matter?”

“P — P — Professor McGonagall!” Hermione gasped,

pointing into the trunk. “Sh — she said I’d failed

everything!”

It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at

last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry,

and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly

inclined to laugh at Hermione ’s boggart, but an

argument was averted by the sight that met them on

the top of the steps.

Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped

cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds.

He started at the sight of Harry.

“Hello there, Harry!” he said. “Just had an exam, I

expect? Nearly finished?”

 

“Yes,” said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on

speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered

awkwardly in the background.

“Lovely day,” said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake.

“Pity ... pity ...”

He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.

“I’m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The

Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures

required a witness to the execution of a mad

hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on

the Black situation, I was asked to step in.”

“Does that mean the appeal’s already happened?” Ron

interrupted, stepping forward.

“No, no, it’s scheduled for this afternoon,” said Fudge,

looking curiously at Ron.

“Then you might not have to witness an execution at

all!” said Ron stoutly. “The hippogriff might get off!”

Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came

through the castle doors behind him. One was so

ancient he appeared to be withering before their very

eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin

black mustache. Harry gathered that they were

representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of

Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard

squinted toward Hagrid’s cabin and said in a feeble

voice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this. ... Two

o’clock, isn’t it, Fudge?”

The black-mustached man was fingering something in

his belt; Harry looked and saw that he was running

one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe.

Ron opened his mouth to say something, but

 

Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her

head toward the entrance hall.

“Why’d you stop me?” said Ron angrily as they

entered the Great Hall for lunch. “Did you see them?

They’ve even got the axe ready! This isn’t justice!”

“Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can’t go

saying things like that to his boss!” said Hermione,

but she too looked very upset. “As long as Hagrid

keeps his head this time, and argues his case

properly, they can’t possibly execute Buckbeak. ...”

But Harry could tell Hermione didn’t really believe

what she was saying. All around them, people were

talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily

anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but

Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid

and Buckbeak, didn’t join in.

Harry’s and Ron’s last exam was Divination;

Hermione’s, Muggle Studies. They walked up the

marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the

first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way

up to the seventh, where many of their class were

sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney’s

classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute

studying.

“She’s seeing us all separately,” Neville informed them

as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy

of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages

devoted to crystal gazing. “Have either of you ever

seen anything in a crystal ball?” he asked them

unhappily.

“Nope,” said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept

checking his watch; Harry knew that he was counting

down the time until Buckbeak’s appeal started.

 

The line of people outside the classroom shortened

very slowly. As each person climbed back down the

silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, “What did

she ask? Was it okay?”

But they all refused to say.

“She says the crystal ball’s told her that if I tell you,

I’ll have a horrible accident!” squeaked Neville as he

clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and

Ron, who had now reached the landing.

“That’s convenient,” snorted Ron. “You know, I’m

starting to think Hermione was right about her” — he

jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead —

“she’s a right old fraud.”

“Yeah,” said Harry, looking at his own watch. It was

now two o’clock. “Wish she’d hurry up ...”

Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with

pride.

“She says I’ve got all the makings of a true Seer,” she

informed Harry and Ron. “I saw loads of stuff. ... Well,

good luck!”

She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward

Lavender.

“Ronald Weasley,” said the familiar, misty voice from

over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed

the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only

person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor

with his back against the wall, listening to a fly

buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the

grounds with Hagrid.

 

Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron’s large feet

reappeared on the ladder.

“How’d it go?” Harry asked him, standing up.

“Rubbish,” said Ron. “Couldn’t see a thing, so I made

some stuff up. Don’t think she was convinced,

though. ...”

“Meet you in the common room,” Harry muttered as

Professor Trelawney’s voice called, “Harry Potter!”

The tower room was hotter than ever before; the

curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the

usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled

through the clutter of chairs and tables to where

Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large

crystal ball.

“Good day, my dear,” she said softly. “If you would

kindly gaze into the Orb. ... Take your time, now ...

then tell me what you see within it. ...”

Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as

hard as he could, willing it to show him something

other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.

“Well?” Professor Trelawney prompted delicately.

“What do you see?”

The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were

stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the

fire beside them. He thought of what Ron had just

said, and decided to pretend.

“Er — ” said Harry, “a dark shape ... um ...”

“What does it resemble?” whispered Professor

Trelawney. “Think, now ...”

 

Harry cast his mind around and it landed on

Buckbeak.

“A hippogriff,” he said firmly.

“Indeed!” whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling

keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees.

“My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor

Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look

closer. . . . Does the hippogriff appear to . . . have its

head?”

“Yes,” said Harry firmly.

“Are you sure?” Professor Trelawney urged him. “Are

you quite sure, dear? You don’t see it writhing on the

ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe

behind it?”

“No!” said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.

“No blood? No weeping Hagrid?”

“No!” said Harry again, wanting more than ever to

leave the room and the heat. “It looks fine, it’s —

flying away. ...”

Professor Trelawney sighed.

“Well, dear, I think we’ll leave it there. ... A little

disappointing ... but I’m sure you did your best.”

Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned

to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.

“It will happen tonight.”

 

Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone

rigid in her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and

her mouth sagging.

“S — sorry?” said Harry.

But Professor Trelawney didn’t seem to hear him. Her

eyes started to roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She

looked as though she was about to have some sort of

seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the

hospital wing — and then Professor Trelawney spoke

again, in the same harsh voice, quite unlike her own:

“The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned

by his followers. His servant has been chained these

twelve years. Tonight, before midnight ... the servant

will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The

Dark Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid,

greater and more terrible than ever he was. Tonight ...

before midnight . . . the servant . . . will set out ... to

rejoin ... his master. ...”

Professor Trelawney’s head fell forward onto her

chest. She made a grunting sort of noise. Harry sat

there, staring at her. Then, quite suddenly, Professor

Trelawney’s head snapped up again.

“I’m so sorry, dear boy,” she said dreamily, “the heat

of the day, you know ... I drifted off for a moment. ...”

Harry sat there, staring at her.

“Is there anything wrong, my dear?”

“You — you just told me that the — the Dark Lord’s

going to rise again ... that his servant’s going to go

back to him. ...”

Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.

 

“The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My

dear boy, that’s hardly something to joke about. ...

Rise again, indeed — ”

“But you just said it! You said the Dark Lord — ”

“I think you must have dozed off too, dear!” said

Professor Trelawney. “I would certainly not presume

to predict anything quite as far-fetched as that\”

Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral

staircase, wondering ... had he just heard Professor

Trelawney make a real prediction? Or had that been

her idea of an impressive end to the test?

Five minutes later he was dashing past the security

trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower,

Professor Trelawney’s words still resounding in his

head. People were striding past him in the opposite

direction, laughing and joking, heading for the

grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom; by the

time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the

common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the

corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione.

“Professor Trelawney,” Harry panted, “just told me — ”

But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces.

“Buckbeak lost,” said Ron weakly. “Hagrid’s just sent

this.”

Hagrid’s note was dry this time, no tears had

splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so

much as he wrote that it was hardly legible.

Lost appeal. They’re going to execute at sunset

Nothing you can do. Don’t come down.

 

I don’t want you to see it

Hagrid

“We’ve got to go,” said Harry at once. “He can’t just sit

there on his own, waiting for the executioner!”

“Sunset, though,” said Ron, who was staring out the

window in a glazed sort of way. “We’d never be

allowed ... ’specially you, Harry. ...”

Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking.

“If we only had the Invisibility Cloak. ...”

“Where is it?” said Hermione.

Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway

under the one-eyed witch.

"... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I’m

in serious trouble,” he finished.

“That’s true,” said Hermione, getting to her feet. “If he

sees you. ... How do you open the witch’s hump

again?”

“You — you tap it and say, ‘Dissendium,’ ” said Harry.

“But — ”

Hermione didn’t wait for the rest of his sentence; she

strode across the room, pushed open the Fat Lady’s

portrait and vanished from sight.

“She hasn’t gone to get it?” Ron said, staring after

her.

 

She had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour

later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her

robes.

“Hermione, I don’t know what’s gotten into you

lately!” said Ron, astounded. “First you hit Malfoy,

then you walk out on Professor Trelawney — ”

Hermione looked rather flattered.

They went down to dinner with everybody else, but

did not return to Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry

had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes; he

had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump. They

skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall,

listening, until they were sure it was deserted. They

heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall

and a door slamming. Hermione poked her head

around the door.

“Okay,” she whispered, “no one there — cloak on — ”

Walking very close together so that nobody would see

them, they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the

cloak, then walked down the stone front steps into

the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the

Forbidden Forest, gilding the top branches of the

trees.

They reached Hagrid’s cabin and knocked. He was a

minute in answering, and when he did, he looked all

around for his visitor, pale-faced and trembling.

“It’s us,” Harry hissed. “We’re wearing the Invisibility

Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.”

“Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered, but he

stood back, and they stepped inside. Hagrid shut the

door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak.

 

Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon

their necks. He looked like a man who did not know

where he was or what to do. This helplessness was

worse to watch than tears.

“Wan’ some tea?” he said. His great hands were

shaking as he reached for the kettle.

“Where’s Buckbeak, Hagrid?” said Hermione

hesitantly.

“I — I took him outside,” said Hagrid, spilling milk all

over the table as he filled up the jug. “He’s tethered in

me pumpkin patch. Thought he oughta see the trees

an’ — an’ smell fresh air — before — ”

Hagrid ’s hand trembled so violently that the milk jug

slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the

floor.

“I’ll do it, Hagrid,” said Hermione quickly, hurrying

over and starting to clean up the mess.

“There’s another one in the cupboard,” Hagrid said,

sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve.

Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly.

“Isn’t there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?” Harry

asked fiercely, sitting down next to him. “Dumbledore

“He’s tried,” said Hagrid. “He’s got no power ter

overrule the Committee. He told ’em Buckbeak’s all

right, but they’re scared. ... Yeh know what Lucius

Malfoy’s like ... threatened ’em, I expect ... an’ the

executioner, Macnair, he’s an old pal o’ Malfoy’s ...

but it’ll be quick an’ clean ... an’ I’ll be beside him. ...”

 

Hagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the

cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or

comfort.

“Dumbledore ’s gonna come down while it — while it

happens. Wrote me this mornin’. Said he wants ter —

ter be with me. Great man, Dumbledore. ...”

Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid ’s

cupboard for another milk jug, let out a small, quickly

stifled sob. She straightened up with the new jug in

her hands, fighting back tears.

“Well stay with you too, Hagrid,” she began, but

Hagrid shook his shaggy head.

“Yeh’re ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don’

wan’ yeh watchin’. An’ yeh shouldn’ be down here

anyway. ... If Fudge an’ Dumbledore catch yeh out

without permission, Harry, yehll be in big trouble.”

Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione ’s

face, but she hid them from Hagrid, bustling around

making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk bottle to

pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek.

“Ron! I — I don’t believe it — it’s Scabbersl”

Ron gaped at her.

“What are you talking about?”

Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and

turned it upside down. With a frantic squeak, and

much scrambling to get back inside, Scabbers the rat

came sliding out onto the table.

“Scabbers!” said Ron blankly. “Scabbers, what are

you doing here?”

 

He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the

light. Scabbers looked dreadful. He was thinner than

ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide

bald patches, and he writhed in Ron’s hands as

though desperate to free himself.

“It’s okay, Scabbers!” said Ron. “No cats! There’s

nothing here to hurt you!”

Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the

window. His normally ruddy face had gone the color

of parchment.

“They’re cornin’. ...”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group

of men was walking down the distant castle steps. In

front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver beard

gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted

Cornelius Fudge. Behind them came the feeble old

Committee member and the executioner, Macnair.

“Yeh gotta go,” said Hagrid. Every inch of him was

trembling. “They mustn’ find yeh here. ... Go now. ...”

Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione

picked up the cloak.

“I’ll let yeh out the back way,” said Hagrid.

They followed him to the door into his back garden.

Harry felt strangely unreal, and even more so when

he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree

behind Hagrid’s pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to

know something was happening. He turned his sharp

head from side to side and pawed the ground

nervously.

 

“It’s okay, Beaky,” said Hagrid softly. “It’s okay ...” He

turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “Go on,” he

said. “Get goin’.”

But they didn’t move.

“Hagrid, we can’t — ”

“Well tell them what really happened — ”

“They can’t kill him — ”

“Go!” said Hagrid fiercely. “It’s bad enough without

you lot in trouble an’ all!”

They had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak

over Harry and Ron, they heard voices at the front of

the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where they had

just vanished from sight.

“Go quick,” he said hoarsely. “Don’ listen. ...”

And he strode back into his cabin as someone

knocked at the front door.

Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and

Hermione set off silently around Hagrid’s house. As

they reached the other side, the front door closed with

a sharp snap.

“Please, let’s hurry,” Hermione whispered. “I can’t

stand it, I can’t bear it. ...”

They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle.

The sun was sinking fast now; the sky had turned to

a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the west there was

a ruby-red glow.

Ron stopped dead.

 

“Oh, please, Ron,” Hermione began.

“It’s Scabbers — he won’t — stay put — ”

Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his

pocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking

madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink his teeth

into Ron’s hand.

“Scabbers, it’s me, you idiot, it’s Ron,” Ron hissed.

They heard a door open behind them and men’s

voices.

“Oh, Ron, please let’s move, they’re going to do it!”

Hermione breathed.

“Okay — Scabbers, stay put — ”

They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was

trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind

them. Ron stopped again.

“I can’t hold him — Scabbers, shut up, everyone’ll

hear us — ”

The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough

to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid’s garden.

There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a

silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable

swish and thud of an axe.

Hermione swayed on the spot.

“They did it!” she whispered to Harry. “I d — don’t

believe it — they did it!”

 

CAT, RAT, AND DOG

Harry’s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of

them stood transfixed with horror under the

Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays of the setting sun

were casting a bloody light over the long-shadowed

grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild

howling.

“Hagrid,” Harry muttered. Without thinking about

what he was doing, he made to turn back, but both

Ron and Hermione seized his arms.

“We can’t,” said Ron, who was paper-white. “He’ll be

in worse trouble if they know we’ve been to see him.

Hermione ’s breathing was shallow and uneven.

“How — could — they?” she choked. “How could

they?”

“Come on,” said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be

chattering.

 

They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to

keep themselves hidden under the cloak. The light

was fading fast now. By the time they reached open

ground, darkness was settling like a spell around

them.

“Scabbers, keep still,” Ron hissed, clamping his hand

over his chest. The rat was wriggling madly. Ron

came to a sudden halt, trying to force Scabbers

deeper into his pocket. “What’s the matter with you,

you stupid rat? Stay still — OUCH! He bit me!”

“Ron, be quiet!” Hermione whispered urgently.

“Fudge’ll be out here in a minute — ”

“He won’t — stay — put — ”

Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with

all his might, trying to break free of Ron’s grip.

“What’s the matter with him?”

But Harry had just seen — slinking toward them, his

body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting

eerily in the darkness — Crookshanks. Whether he

could see them or was following the sound of

Scabbers’s squeaks, Harry couldn’t tell.

“Crookshanks!” Hermione moaned. “No, go away,

Crookshanks! Go away!”

But the cat was getting nearer —

“Scabbers — NO!”

Too late — the rat had slipped between Ron’s

clutching fingers, hit the ground, and scampered

away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him,

and before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ron

 

had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and

pelted away into the darkness.

“Ron\” Hermione moaned.

She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at

a sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the

cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them

like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could

hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts

at Crookshanks.

“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come

here — ”

There was a loud thud.

“Gotchal Get off, you stinking cat — ”

Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they

skidded to a stop right in front of him. He was

sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in

his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the

quivering lump.

“Ron — come on — back under the cloak — ”

Hermione panted. “Dumbledore — the Minister —

they’ll be coming back out in a minute — ”

But before they could cover themselves again, before

they could even catch their breath, they heard the

soft pounding of gigantic paws. ... Something was

bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow — an

enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog.

Harry reached for his wand, but too late — the dog

had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit

him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl

of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth —

 

But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled

off him. Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were

broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it

growling as it skidded around for a new attack.

Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward

them he pushed Harry aside; the dog’s jaws fastened

instead around Ron’s outstretched arm. Harry lunged

forward, he seized a handful of the brute’s hair, but it

was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a

rag doll —

Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard

across the face he was knocked off his feet again. He

heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too.

Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his

eyes —

“Lumos\” he whispered.

The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree;

they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the

Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as

though in a high wind, whipping backward and

forward to stop them going nearer.

And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog,

dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots

— Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso

were slipping out of sight —

“Ron!” Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy

branch whipped lethally through the air and he was

forced backward again.

All they could see now was one of Ron’s legs, which

he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the

dog from pulling him farther underground — but a

 

horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron’s leg

had broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished

from sight.

“Harry — we’ve got to go for help — ” Hermione

gasped; she was bleeding too; the Willow had cut her

across the shoulder.

“No! That thing’s big enough to eat him; we haven’t

got time — ”

“Harry — we’re never going to get through without

help — ”

Another branch whipped down at them, twigs

clenched like knuckles.

“If that dog can get in, we can,” Harry panted, darting

here and there, trying to find a way through the

vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn’t get an

inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of

the tree’s blows.

“Oh, help, help,” Hermione whispered frantically,

dancing uncertainly on the spot, “please ...”

Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between

the battering branches like a snake and placed his

front paws upon a knot on the trunk.

Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to

marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or

shook.

“Crookshanks!” Hermione whispered uncertainly. She

now grasped Harry’s arm painfully hard. “How did he

know — ?”

 

“He’s friends with that dog,” said Harry grimly. “I’ve

seen them together. Come on — and keep your wand

out — ”

They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds,

but before they had reached the gap in the roots,

Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his

bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward,

headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the

bottom of a very low tunnel. Crookshanks was a little

way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry’s

wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside

him.

“Where’s Ron?” she whispered in a terrified voice.

“This way,” said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after

Crookshanks.

“Where does this tunnel come out?” Hermione asked

breathlessly from behind him.

“I don’t know. ... It’s marked on the Marauder’s Map

but Fred and George said no one’s ever gotten into it.

...It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it

was heading for Hogsmeade. ...”

They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double;

ahead of them, Crookshanks ’s tail bobbed in and out

of view. On and on went the passage; it felt at least as

long as the one to Honeydukes. ... All Harry could

think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might

be doing to him. ... He was drawing breath in sharp,

painful gasps, running at a crouch. ...

And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it

twisted, and Crookshanks had gone. Instead, Harry

could see a patch of dim light through a small

opening.

 

He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging

forward. Both raised their wands to see what lay

beyond.

It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper

was peeling from the walls; there were stains all over

the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as

though somebody had smashed it. The windows were

all boarded up.

Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very

frightened but nodded.

Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around.

The room was deserted, but a door to their right stood

open, leading to a shadowy hallway. Hermione

suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm again. Her wide eyes

were traveling around the boarded windows.

“Harry,” she whispered, “I think we’re in the Shrieking

Shack.”

Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair

near them. Large chunks had been torn out of it; one

of the legs had been ripped off entirely.

“Ghosts didn’t do that,” he said slowly.

At that moment, there was a creak overhead.

Something had moved upstairs. Both of them looked

up at the ceiling. Hermione ’s grip on Harry’s arm was

so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers. He raised

his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.

Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and

up the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered

in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide

shiny stripe had been made by something being

dragged upstairs.

 

They reached the dark landing.

“Nox,” they whispered together, and the lights at the

end of their wands went out. Only one door was open.

As they crept toward it, they heard movement from

behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring.

They exchanged a last look, a last nod.

Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door

wide open.

On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings

lay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them.

On the floor beside him, clutching his leg, which

stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.

Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.

“Ron — are you okay?”

“Where’s the dog?”

“Not a dog,” Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with

pain. “Harry, it’s a trap — ”

“What — ”

“He’s the dog ... he’s an Animagus. ...”

Ron was staring over Harry’s shoulder. Harry wheeled

around. With a snap, the man in the shadows closed

the door behind them.

A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If

eyes hadn’t been shining out of the deep, dark

sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy skin

was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it

looked like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a

grin. It was Sirius Black.

 

“ ExpelliarmusV’ he croaked, pointing Ron’s wand at

them.

Harry’s and Hermione’s wands shot out of their

hands, high in the air, and Black caught them. Then

he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed on Harry.

“I thought you’d come and help your friend,” he said

hoarsely. His voice sounded as though he had long

since lost the habit of using it. “Your father would

have done the same for me. Brave of you, not to run

for a teacher. I’m grateful ... it will make everything

much easier. ...”

The taunt about his father rang in Harry’s ears as

though Black had bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted

in Harry’s chest, leaving no place for fear. For the first

time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his hand,

not to defend himself, but to attack ... to kill. Without

knowing what he was doing, he started forward, but

there was a sudden movement on either side of him

and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him

back. ... “No, Harry!” Hermione gasped in a petrified

whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black.

“If you want to kill Harry, you’ll have to kill us too!”

he said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright

was draining him of still more color, and he swayed

slightly as he spoke.

Something flickered in Black’s shadowed eyes.

“Lie down,” he said quietly to Ron. “You will damage

that leg even more.”

“Did you hear me?” Ron said weakly, though he was

clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright. “You’ll

have to kill all three of us!”

 

“There’ll be only one murder here tonight,” said Black,

and his grin widened.

“Why’s that?” Harry spat, trying to wrench himself

free of Ron and Hermione. “Didn’t care last time, did

you? Didn’t mind slaughtering all those Muggles to

get at Pettigrew. ... What’s the matter, gone soft in

Azkaban?”

“Harry!” Hermione whimpered. “Be quiet!”

“HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!” Harry roared, and

with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione ’s and

Ron’s restraint and lunged forward —

He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that

he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black

was a tall, full-grown man — all Harry knew was that

he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and

that he didn’t care how much he got hurt in return —

Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so

stupid, but Black didn’t raise the wands in time —

one of Harry’s hands fastened over his wasted wrist,

forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry’s

other hand collided with the side of Black’s head and

they fell, backward, into the wall —

Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was

a blinding flash as the wands in Black’s hand sent a

jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry’s face by

inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers

twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand

punching every part of Black it could find.

But Black’s free hand had found Harry’s throat —

“No,” he hissed, “I’ve waited too long — ”

 

The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses

askew.

Then he saw Hermione ’s foot swing out of nowhere.

Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had

thrown himself on Black’s wand hand and Harry

heard a faint clatter —

He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own

wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward

it but —

“Argh!”

Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front

claws had sunk themselves deep into Harry’s arm;

Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted

toward Harry’s wand —

“NO YOU DONT!” roared Harry, and he aimed a kick

at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside,

spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned —

“Get out of the way!” he shouted at Ron and

Hermione.

They didn’t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for

breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching

up her and Ron’s wands. Ron crawled to the four-

poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face

now tinged with green, both hands clutching his

broken leg.

Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin

chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry

walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at

Black’s heart.

“Going to kill me, Harry?” he whispered.

 

Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing

at Black’s chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise

was rising around Black’s left eye and his nose was

bleeding.

“You killed my parents,” said Harry, his voice shaking

slightly, but his wand hand quite steady.

Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.

“I don’t deny it,” he said very quietly. “But if you knew

the whole story.”

“The whole story?” Harry repeated, a furious

pounding in his ears. “You sold them to Voldemort.

That’s all I need to know.”

“You’ve got to listen to me,” Black said, and there was

a note of urgency in his voice now. “You’ll regret it if

you don’t. ... You don’t understand. ...”

“I understand a lot better than you think,” said Harry,

and his voice shook more than ever. “You never heard

her, did you? My mum ... trying to stop Voldemort

killing me ... and you did that ... you did it. ...”

Before either of them could say another word,

something ginger streaked past Harry; Crookshanks

leapt onto Black’s chest and settled himself there,

right over Black’s heart. Black blinked and looked

down at the cat.

“Get off,” he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks

off him.

But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black’s robes

and wouldn’t shift. He turned his ugly, squashed face

to Harry and looked up at him with those great yellow

eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.

 

Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his

grip tightening on the wand. So what if he had to kill

the cat too? It was in league with Black. ... If it was

prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that wasn’t

Harry’s business. ... If Black wanted to save it, that

only proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for

Harry’s parents. ...

Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it.

Now was the moment to avenge his mother and

father. He was going to kill Black. He had to kill

Black. This was his chance. ...

The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen

there, wand poised, Black staring up at him,

Crookshanks on his chest. Ron’s ragged breathing

came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.

And then came a new sound —

Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor

— someone was moving downstairs.

“WE’RE UP HERE!” Hermione screamed suddenly.

“WE’RE UP HERE — SIRIUS BLACK — QUICK!”

Black made a startled movement that almost

dislodged Crookshanks; Harry gripped his wand

convulsively — Do it nouA said a voice in his head —

but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and

Harry still hadn’t done it.

The door of the room burst open in a shower of red

sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin

came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his

wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron,

lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the

door, to Harry, standing there with his wand covering

 

Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and

bleeding at Harry’s feet.

“ ExpelliarmusV’ Lupin shouted.

Harry’s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did

the two Hermione was holding. Lupin caught them all

deftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black,

who still had Crookshanks lying protectively across

his chest.

Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn’t

done it. His nerve had failed him. Black was going to

be handed back to the dementors.

Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.

“Where is he, Sirius?”

Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn’t understand

what Lupin meant. Who was Lupin talking about? He

turned to look at Black again.

Black’s face was quite expressionless. For a few

seconds, he didn’t move at all. Then, very slowly, he

raised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron.

Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked

bewildered.

“But then ... ,” Lupin muttered, staring at Black so

intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind, "...

why hasn’t he shown himself before now? Unless” —

Lupin’s eyes suddenly widened, as though he was

seeing something beyond Black, something none of

the rest could see, “ — unless he was the one ...

unless you switched . . . without telling me?”

Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin’s

face, Black nodded.

 

“Professor,” Harry interrupted loudly, “what’s going

on — ?”

But he never finished the question, because what he

saw made his voice die in his throat. Lupin was

lowering his wand, gazing fixedly at Black. The

Professor walked to Black’s side, seized his hand,

pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the

floor, and embraced Black like a brother.

Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of

his stomach.

“I DONT BELIEVE IT!” Hermione screamed.

Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had

raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin,

wild-eyed. “You — you — ”

“Hermione — ”

“ — you and him!”

“Hermione, calm down — ”

“I didn’t tell anyone!” Hermione shrieked. “I’ve been

covering up for you — ”

“Hermione, listen to me, please!” Lupin shouted. “I

can explain — ”

Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but

with a fresh wave of fury.

“I trusted you,” he shouted at Lupin, his voice

wavering out of control, “and all the time you’ve been

his friend!”

 

“You’re wrong,” said Lupin. “I haven’t been Sirius’s

friend, but I am now — Let me explain. ...”

“NO!” Hermione screamed. “Harry, don’t trust him,

he’s been helping Black get into the castle, he wants

you dead too — he’s a werewolf.”

There was a ringing silence. Everyone’s eyes were now

on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather

pale.

“Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,” he

said. “Only one out of three, I’m afraid. I have not

been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly

don’t want Harry dead. ...” An odd shiver passed over

his face. “But I won’t deny that I am a werewolf.”

Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back

with a whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him,

looking concerned, but Ron gasped,

“Get away from me, werewolf”

Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he

turned to Hermione and said, “How long have you

known?”

“Ages,” Hermione whispered. “Since I did Professor

Snape’s essay. ...”

“He’ll be delighted,” said Lupin coolly. “He assigned

that essay hoping someone would realize what my

symptoms meant. ... Did you check the lunar chart

and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or

did you realize that the boggart changed into the

moon when it saw me?”

“Both,” Hermione said quietly.

 

Lupin forced a laugh.

“You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met,

Hermione.”

“I’m not,” Hermione whispered. “If I’d been a bit

cleverer, I’d have told everyone what you are!”

“But they already know,” said Lupin. “At least, the

staff do.”

“Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a

werewolf?” Ron gasped. “Is he mad?”

“Some of the staff thought so,” said Lupin. “He had to

work very hard to convince certain teachers that I’m

trustworthy — ”

“AND HE WAS WRONG!” Harry yelled. “YOU VE BEEN

HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!” He was pointing at

Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed

and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking

hand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped

onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from both of

them, dragging his leg.

“I have not been helping Sirius,” said Lupin. “If you’ll

give me a chance, I’ll explain. Look — ”

He separated Harry’s, Ron’s and Hermione’s wands

and threw each back to its owner; Harry caught his,

stunned.

“There,” said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into

his belt. “You’re armed, we’re not. Now will you

listen?”

Harry didn’t know what to think. Was it a trick?

 

“If you haven’t been helping him,” he said, with a

furious glance at Black, “how did you know he was

here?”

“The map,” said Lupin. “The Marauder’s Map. I was in

my office examining it — ”

“You know how to work it?” Harry said suspiciously.

“Of course I know how to work it,” said Lupin, waving

his hand impatiently. “I helped write it. I’m Moony —

that was my friends’ nickname for me at school.”

“You wrote — ?”

“The important thing is, I was watching it carefully

this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron,

and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to

visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I

was right, wasn’t I?”

He had started to pace up and down, looking at them.

Little patches of dust rose at his feet.

“You might have been wearing your father’s old cloak,

Harry — ”

“How d’you know about the cloak?”

“The number of times I saw James disappearing

under it... ,” said Lupin, waving an impatient hand

again. “The point is, even if you’re wearing an

Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s

Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter

Hagrid’s hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid,

and set off back toward the castle. But you were now

accompanied by somebody else.”

“What?” said Harry. “No, we weren’t!”

 

“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” said Lupin, still pacing,

and ignoring Harry’s interruption. “I thought the map

must be malfunctioning. How could he be with you?”

“No one was with us!” said Harry.

“And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you,

labeled Sirius Black. ... I saw him collide with you; I

watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping

Willow — ”

“One of us!” Ron said angrily.

“No, Ron,” said Lupin. “Two of you.”

He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.

“Do you think I could have a look at the rat?” he said

evenly.

“What?” said Ron. “What’s Scabbers got to do with

it?”

“Everything,” said Lupin. “Could I see him, please?”

Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes.

Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to

seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping.

Crookshanks stood up on Black’s leg and made a soft

hissing noise.

Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding

his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.

“What?” Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to

him, looking scared. “What’s my rat got to do with

anything?”

“That’s not a rat,” croaked Sirius Black suddenly.

 

“What d’you mean — of course he’s a rat — ”

“No, he’s not,” said Lupin quietly. “He’s a wizard.”

“An Animagus,” said Black, “by the name of Peter

Pettigrew.”

 

MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND

PRONGS

It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this

statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry

was thinking.

“You’re both mental.”

“Ridiculous!” said Hermione faintly.

“Peter Pettigrew’s dead!” said Harry. “He killed him

twelve years ago!” He pointed at Black, whose face

twitched convulsively.

“I meant to,” he growled, his yellow teeth bared, “but

little Peter got the better of me ... not this time,

though!”

And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black

lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black’s

weight fell on his broken leg.

 

“Sirius, NO!” Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards

and dragging Black away from Ron again, “WAIT! You

can’t do it just like that — they need to understand —

we’ve got to explain — ”

“We can explain afterwards!” snarled Black, trying to

throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as

it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a

piglet, scratching Ron’s face and neck as he tried to

escape.

“They’ve — got — a — right — to — know —

everything!” Lupin panted, still trying to restrain

Black. “Ron’s kept him as a pet! There are parts of it

even I don’t understand! And Harry — you owe Harry

the truth, Sirius!”

Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes

were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly

under Ron’s bitten, scratched, and bleeding hands.

“All right, then,” Black said, without taking his eyes

off the rat. “Tell them whatever you like. But make it

quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was

imprisoned for. ...”

“You’re nutters, both of you,” said Ron shakily,

looking round at Harry and Hermione for support.

“I’ve had enough of this. I’m off.”

He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but

Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers.

“You’re going to hear me out, Ron,” he said quietly.

“Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.”

“HE’S NOT PETER, HE’S SCABBERS!” Ron yelled,

trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but

Scabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed and

 

overbalanced, and Harry caught him and pushed him

back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry

turned to Lupin.

“There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,” he

said. “A whole street full of them ...”

“They didn’t see what they thought they saw!” said

Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in

Ron’s hands.

“Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,” said Lupin,

nodding. “I believed it myself — until I saw the map

tonight. Because the Marauder’s map never lies ...

Peter’s alive. Ron’s holding him, Harry.”

Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met,

they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out

of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever.

How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban

must have unhinged Black after all — but why was

Lupin playing along with him?

Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm

sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin

to talk sensibly.

“But Professor Lupin ... Scabbers can’t be Pettigrew

... it just can’t be true, you know it can’t ...”

“Why can’t it be true?” Lupin said calmly, as though

they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted

a problem in an experiment with grindylows.

“Because . . . because people would know if Peter

Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in

class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them

up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic

keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become

 

animals; there’s a register showing what animal they

become, and their markings and things ... and I went

and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register,

and there have been only seven Animagi this century,

and Pettigrew’s name wasn’t on the list — ”

Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the

effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin

started to laugh. “Right again, Hermione!” he said.

“But the Ministry never knew that there used to be

three unregistered Animagi running around

Hogwarts.”

“If you’re going to tell them the story, get a move on,

Remus,” snarled Black, who was still watching

Scabbers’s every desperate move. “I’ve waited twelve

years, I’m not going to wait much longer.”

“All right ... but you’ll need to help me, Sirius,” said

Lupin, “I only know how it began ...”

Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind

him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord.

All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward

it and looked out into the landing.

“No one there ...”

“This place is haunted!” said Ron.

“It’s not,” said Lupin, still looking at the door in a

puzzled way. “The Shrieking Shack was never

haunted. ... The screams and howls the villagers used

to hear were made by me.”

He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought

for a moment, then said, “That’s where all of this

starts — with my becoming a werewolf. None of this

 

could have happened if I hadn’t been bitten ... and if I

hadn’t been so foolhardy. ...”

He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt,

but Hermione said, “Shh!” She was watching Lupin

very intently.

“I was a very small boy when I received the bite. My

parents tried everything, but in those days there was

no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been

making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me

safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week

preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I

transform. ... I am able to curl up in my office, a

harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.

“Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered,

however, I became a fully fledged monster once a

month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to

come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren’t likely to

want their children exposed to me.

“But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he

was sympathetic. He said that as long as we took

certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn’t

come to school. ...” Lupin sighed, and looked directly

at Harry. “I told you, months ago, that the Whomping

Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The

truth is that it was planted because I came to

Hogwarts. This house” — Lupin looked miserably

around the room, — “the tunnel that leads to it —

they were built for my use. Once a month, I was

smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to

transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth

to stop anyone coming across me while I was

dangerous.”

Harry couldn’t see where this story was going, but he

was listening raptly all the same. The only sound

 

apart from Lupin’s voice was Scabbers’s frightened

squeaking.

“My transformations in those days were — were

terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I

was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and

scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the

noise and the screaming and thought they were

hearing particularly violent spirits. Dumbledore

encouraged the rumor. . . . Even now, when the house

has been silent for years, the villagers don’t dare

approach it. ...

“But apart from my transformations, I was happier

than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever,

I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black ...

Peter Pettigrew ... and, of course, your father, Harry

— James Potter.

“Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that

I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of

stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had

to go home to see her. ... I was terrified they would

desert me the moment they found out what I was. But

of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the

truth. ...

“And they didn’t desert me at all. Instead, they did

something for me that would make my

transformations not only bearable, but the best times

of my life. They became Animagi.”

“My dad too?” said Harry, astounded.

“Yes, indeed,” said Lupin. “It took them the best part

of three years to work out how to do it. Your father

and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the

school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus

transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason

 

the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting

to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from

James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they

managed it. They could each turn into a different

animal at will.”

“But how did that help you?” said Hermione,

sounding puzzled.

“They couldn’t keep me company as humans, so they

kept me company as animals,” said Lupin. “A

werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out

of the castle every month under James’s Invisibility

Cloak. They transformed . . . Peter, as the smallest,

could slip beneath the Willow’s attacking branches

and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then

slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their

influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still

wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while

I was with them.”

“Hurry up, Remus,” snarled Black, who was still

watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on

his face.

“I’m getting there, Sirius, I’m getting there ... well,

highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that

we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the

Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and

the village by night. Sirius and James transformed

into such large animals, they were able to keep a

werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts

students ever found out more about the Hogwarts

grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. ... And that’s

how we came to write the Marauder’s Map, and sign it

with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is

Wormtail. James was Prongs.”

 

“What sort of animal — ?” Harry began, but Hermione

cut him off.

“That was still really dangerous! Running around in

the dark with a werewolf! What if you’d given the

others the slip, and bitten somebody?”

“A thought that still haunts me,” said Lupin heavily.

“And there were near misses, many of them. We

laughed about them afterwards. We were young,

thoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness.”

“I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore’s

trust, of course ... he had admitted me to Hogwarts

when no other headmaster would have done so, and

he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set

down for my own and others’ safety. He never knew I

had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi

illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty

feelings every time we sat down to plan our next

month’s adventure. And I haven’t changed ...”

Lupin’s face had hardened, and there was self-disgust

in his voice. “All this year, I have been battling with

myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore

that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn’t do it. Why?

Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant

admitting that I’d betrayed his trust while I was at

school, admitting that I’d led others along with me ...

and Dumbledore’s trust has meant everything to me.

He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a

job when I have been shunned all my adult life,

unable to find paid work because of what I am. And

so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the

school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort,

that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it . . .

so, in a way, Snape’s been right about me all along.”

 

“Snape?” said Black harshly, taking his eyes off

Scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up

at Lupin. “What’s Snape got to do with it?”

“He’s here, Sirius,” said Lupin heavily. “He’s teaching

here as well.” He looked up at Harry, Ron, and

Hermione.

“Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought

very hard against my appointment to the Defense

Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling

Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. He

has his reasons ... you see, Sirius here played a trick

on him which nearly killed him, a trick which

involved me — ”

Black made a derisive noise.

“It served him right,” he sneered. “Sneaking around,

trying to find out what we were up to . . . hoping he

could get us expelled. ...”

“Severus was very interested in where I went every

month.” Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “We

were in the same year, you know, and we — er —

didn’t like each other very much. He especially

disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James’s talent on

the Quidditch field . . . anyway Snape had seen me

crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one

evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow

to transform. Sirius thought it would be — er —

amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the

knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he’d be

able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it

— if he’d got as far as this house, he’d have met a

fully grown werewolf — but your father, who’d heard

what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled

him back, at great risk to his life . . . Snape glimpsed

me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was

 

forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from

that time on he knew what I was. ...”

“So that’s why Snape doesn’t like you,” said Harry

slowly, “because he thought you were in on the joke?”

“That’s right,” sneered a cold voice from the wall

behind Lupin.

Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak,

his wand pointing directly at Lupin.

 

THE SERVANT OF LORD

VOLDERMORT

Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt

as though he’d received a huge electric shock.

“I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,”

said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep

this wand pointing directly at Lupin’s chest. “Very

useful, Potter, I thank you. ...”

Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of

suppressed triumph. “You’re wondering, perhaps,

how I knew you were here?” he said, his eyes

glittering. “I’ve just been to your office, Lupin. You

forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful

along. And very lucky I did ... lucky for me, I mean.

Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at

it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running

along this passageway and out of sight.”

“Severus — ” Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.

 

“I’ve told the headmaster again and again that you’re

helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin,

and here’s the proof. Not even I dreamed you would

have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout

“Severus, you’re making a mistake,” said Lupin

urgently. “You haven’t heard everything — I can

explain — Sirius is not here to kill Harry — ”

“Two more for Azkaban tonight,” said Snape, his eyes

now gleaming fanatically. “I shall be interested to see

how Dumbledore takes this. ... He was quite

convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin ... a

tame werewolf — ”

“You fool,” said Lupin softly. “Is a schoolboy grudge

worth putting an innocent man back inside

Azkaban?”

BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of

Snape’s wand and twisted themselves around Lupin’s

mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell

to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage,

Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his

wand straight between Black’s eyes.

“Give me a reason,” he whispered. “Give me a reason

to do it, and I swear I will.”

Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to

say which face showed more hatred.

Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do

or whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and

Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still

fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers.

Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward

Snape and said, in a very breathless voice, “Professor

 

Snape — it — it wouldn’t hurt to hear what they’ve

got to say, w — would it?”

“Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension

from this school,” Snape spat. “You, Potter, and

Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a

convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your

life, hold your tongue.”

“But if — if there was a mistake — ”

“KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!” Snape shouted,

looking suddenly quite deranged. “DONT TALK

ABOUT WHAT YOU DONT UNDERSTAND!” A few

sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was

still pointed at Black’s face. Hermione fell silent.

“Vengeance is very sweet,” Snape breathed at Black.

“How I hoped I would be the one to catch you. ...”

“The joke’s on you again, Severus,” Black snarled. “As

long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle” — he

jerked his head at Ron — “I’ll come quietly. ...”

“Up to the castle?” said Snape silkily. “I don’t think

we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the

dementors once we get out of the Willow. They’ll be

very pleased to see you, Black ... pleased enough to

give you a little kiss, I daresay. ...”

What little color there was in Black’s face left it.

“You — you’ve got to hear me out,” he croaked. “The

rat — look at the rat — ”

But there was a mad glint in Snape ’s eyes that Harry

had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason.

 

“Come on, all of you,” he said. He clicked his fingers,

and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to

his hands. “Ill drag the werewolf. Perhaps the

dementors will have a kiss for him too — ”

Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed

the room in three strides and blocked the door.

“Get out of the way, Potter, you’re in enough trouble

already,” snarled Snape. “If I hadn’t been here to save

your skin — ”

“Professor Lupin could have killed me about a

hundred times this year,” Harry said. “I’ve been alone

with him loads of times, having defense lessons

against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why

didn’t he just finish me off then?”

“Don’t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf’s mind

works,” hissed Snape. “Get out of the way, Potter.”

“YOU’RE PATHETIC!” Harry yelled. “JUST BECAUSE

THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU

WONT EVEN LISTEN — ”

“SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!”

Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. “Like

father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck;

you should be thanking me on bended knee! You

would have been well served if he’d killed you! You’d

have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you

might be mistaken in Black — now get out of the way,

or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!”

Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before

Snape could take even one step toward him, he had

raised his wand.

 

“ Expelliarmus\” he yelled — except that his wasn’t the

only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made

the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his

feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to

the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair.

He had been knocked out.

Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had

tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment.

Snape ’s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the

bed next to Crookshanks.

“You shouldn’t have done that,” said Black, looking at

Harry. “You should have left him to me. ...”

Harry avoided Black’s eyes. He wasn’t sure, even now,

that he’d done the right thing.

“We attacked a teacher. ... We attacked a teacher ... ,”

Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape

with frightened eyes. “Oh, we’re going to be in so

much trouble — ”

Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent

down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up,

rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them.

“Thank you, Harry,” he said.

“I’m still not saying I believe you,” he told Lupin.

“Then it’s time we offered you some proof,” said

Lupin. “You, boy — give me Peter, please. Now.”

Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.

“Come off it,” he said weakly. “Are you trying to say

he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on

Scabbers ? I mean ...” He looked up at Harry and

 

Hermione for support, “Okay, say Pettigrew could

turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how’s he

supposed to know which one he’s after if he was

locked up in Azkaban?”

“You know, Sirius, that’s a fair question,” said Lupin,

turning to Black and frowning slightly. “How did you

find out where he was?”

Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes

and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he

smoothed flat and held out to show the others.

It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had

appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer,

and there, on Ron’s shoulder, was Scabbers.

“How did you get this?” Lupin asked Black,

thunderstruck.

“Fudge,” said Black. “When he came to inspect

Azkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And there

was Peter, on the front page ... on this boy’s shoulder.

... I knew him at once . . . how many times had I seen

him transform? And the caption said the boy would

be going back to Hogwarts ... to where Harry was. ...”

“My God,” said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to

the picture in the paper and back again. “His front

paw ...”

“What about it?” said Ron defiantly.

“He’s got a toe missing,” said Black.

“Of course,” Lupin breathed. “So simple ... so brilliant

... he cut it off himself?”

 

“Just before he transformed,” said Black. “When I

cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear

that I’d betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could

curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand

behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of

himself — and sped down into the sewer with the

other rats. ...”

“Didn’t you ever hear, Ron?” said Lupin. “The biggest

bit of Peter they found was his finger.”

“Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat

or something! He’s been in my family for ages, right —

“Twelve years, in fact,” said Lupin. “Didn’t you ever

wonder why he was living so long?”

“We — we’ve been taking good care of him!” said Ron.

“Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?”

said Lupin. “I’d guess he’s been losing weight ever

since he heard Sirius was on the loose again. ...”

“He’s been scared of that mad cat!” said Ron, nodding

toward Crookshanks, who was still purring on the

bed.

But that wasn’t right, Harry thought suddenly. ...

Scabbers had been looking ill before he met

Crookshanks . . . ever since Ron’s return from Egypt . . .

since the time when Black had escaped. ...

“This cat isn’t mad,” said Black hoarsely. He reached

out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks ’s fluffy

head. “He’s the most intelligent of his kind I’ve ever

met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away.

And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a

while before he trusted me. ... Finally, I managed to

 

communicate to him what I was after, and he’s been

helping me. ...”

“What do you mean?” breathed Hermione.

“He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn’t ... so he

stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me. ...

As I understand it, he took them from a boy’s bedside

table. ...”

Harry’s brain seemed to be sagging under the weight

of what he was hearing. It was absurd . . . and yet . . .

“But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for

it. ...” croaked Black. “This cat — Crookshanks, did

you call him? — told me Peter had left blood on the

sheets. ... I supposed he bit himself. ... Well, faking

his own death had worked once. ...”

These words jolted Harry to his senses.

“And why did he fake his death?” he said furiously.

“Because he knew you were about to kill him like you

killed my parents!”

“No,” said Lupin, “Harry — ”

“And now you’ve come to finish him off!”

“Yes, I have,” said Black, with an evil look at

Scabbers.

“Then I should’ve let Snape take you!” Harry shouted.

“Harry,” said Lupin hurriedly, “don’t you see? All this

time we’ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and

Peter tracked him down — but it was the other way

around, don’t you see? Peter betrayed your mother

and father — Sirius tracked Peter down — ”

 

“THAT’S NOT TRUE!” Harry yelled. “HE WAS THEIR

SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU

TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!”

He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly;

the sunken eyes were suddenly overbright.

“Harry ... I as good as killed them,” he croaked. “I

persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the

last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-

Keeper instead of me. ... I’m to blame, I know it. ...

The night they died, I’d arranged to check on Peter,

make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his

hiding place, he’d gone. Yet there was no sign of a

struggle. It didn’t feel right. I was scared. I set out for

your parents’ house straight away. And when I saw

their house, destroyed, and their bodies ... I realized

what Peter must’ve done ... what I’d done. ...”

His voice broke. He turned away.

“Enough of this,” said Lupin, and there was a steely

note in his voice Harry had never heard before.

“There’s one certain way to prove what really

happened. Ron, give me that rat”

“What are you going to do with him if I give him to

you?” Ron asked Lupin tensely.

“Force him to show himself,” said Lupin. “If he really

is a rat, it won’t hurt him.”

Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out

Scabbers and Lupin took him. Scabbers began to

squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his

tiny black eyes bulging in his head.

“Ready, Sirius?” said Lupin.

 

Black had already retrieved Snape’s wand from the

bed. He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and

his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his

face.

“Together?” he said quietly.

“I think so,” said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in

one hand and his wand in the other. “On the count of

three. One — two — THREE!”

A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands;

for a moment, Scabbers was frozen in midair, his

small gray form twisting madly — Ron yelled — the

rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding

flash of light and then —

It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing

tree. A head was shooting upward from the ground;

limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a man was

standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and

wringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and

snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was

standing up.

He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry

and Hermione. His thin, colorless hair was unkempt

and there was a large bald patch on top. He had the

shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a

lot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby,

almost like Scabbers ’s fur, and something of the rat

lingered around his pointed nose and his very small,

watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his

breathing fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to

the door and back again.

“Well, hello, Peter,” said Lupin pleasantly, as though

rats frequently erupted into old school friends around

him. “Long time, no see.”

 

“S — Sirius ... R — Remus ...” Even Pettigrew’s voice

was squeaky. Again, his eyes darted toward the door.

“My friends ... my old friends ...”

Black’s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around

the wrist, gave him a warning look, then turned again

to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual.

“We’ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what

happened the night Lily and James died. You might

have missed the finer points while you were

squeaking around down there on the bed — ”

“Remus,” gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see

beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, “you

don’t believe him, do you... ? He tried to kill me,

Remus. ...”

“So we’ve heard,” said Lupin, more coldly. “I’d like to

clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if

you’d be so — ”

“He’s come to try and kill me again!” Pettigrew

squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw

that he used his middle finger, because his index was

missing. “He killed Lily and James and now he’s going

to kill me too. ... You’ve got to help me, Remus. ...”

Black’s face looked more skull-like than ever as he

stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes.

“No one’s going to try and kill you until we’ve sorted a

few things out,” said Lupin.

“Sorted things out?” squealed Pettigrew, looking

wildly about him once more, eyes taking in the

boarded windows and, again, the only door. “I knew

he’d come after me! I knew he’d be back for me! I’ve

been waiting for this for twelve years!”

 

“You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?”

said Lupin, his brow furrowed. “When nobody has

ever done it before?”

“He’s got dark powers the rest of us can only dream

of!” Pettigrew shouted shrilly. “How else did he get out

of there? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named

taught him a few tricks!”

Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh

that filled the whole room.

“Voldemort, teach me tricks?” he said.

Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a

whip at him.

“What, scared to hear your old master’s name?” said

Black. “I don’t blame you, Peter. His lot aren’t very

happy with you, are they?”

“Don’t know what you mean, Sirius — ” muttered

Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His whole

face was shining with sweat now.

“You haven’t been hiding from me for twelve years,”

said Black. “You’ve been hiding from Voldemort’s old

supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter. ... They

all think you’re dead, or you’d have to answer to

them. ... I’ve heard them screaming all sorts of things

in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-

crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the

Potters’ on your information ... and Voldemort met his

downfall there. And not all Voldemort’s supporters

ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty

out here, biding their time, pretending they’ve seen

the error of their ways. ... If they ever got wind that

you were still alive, Peter — ”

 

“Don’t know ... what you’re talking about... said

Pettigrew again, more shrilly than ever. He wiped his

face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. “You don’t

believe this — this madness, Remus — ”

“I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in

understanding why an innocent man would want to

spend twelve years as a rat,” said Lupin evenly.

“Innocent, but scared!” squealed Pettigrew. “If

Voldemort’s supporters were after me, it was because

I put one of their best men in Azkaban — the spy,

Sirius Black!”

Black’s face contorted.

“How dare you,” he growled, sounding suddenly like

the bear-sized dog he had been. “I, a spy for

Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who

were stronger and more powerful than myself? But

you, Peter — I’ll never understand why I didn’t see

you were the spy from the start. You always liked big

friends who’d look after you, didn’t you? It used to be

us ... me and Remus ... and James. ...”

Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting

for breath.

“Me, a spy ... must be out of your mind ... never ...

don’t know how you can say such a — ”

“Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper

because I suggested it,” Black hissed, so venomously

that Pettigrew took a step backward. “I thought it was

the perfect plan ... a bluff. ... Voldemort would be

sure to come after me, would never dream they’d use

a weak, talentless thing like you. ... It must have been

the finest moment of your miserable life, telling

Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.”

 

Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught

words like “far-fetched” and “lunacy,” but he couldn’t

help paying more attention to the ashen color of

Pettigrew’s face and the way his eyes continued to

dart toward the windows and door.

“Professor Lupin?” said Hermione timidly. “Can — can

I say something?”

“Certainly, Hermione,” said Lupin courteously.

“Well — Scabbers — I mean, this — this man — he’s

been sleeping in Harry’s dormitory for three years. If

he’s working for You-Know-Who, how come he never

tried to hurt Harry before now?”

“There!” said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with

his maimed hand. “Thank you! You see, Remus? I

have never hurt a hair of Harry’s head! Why should

I?”

“I’ll tell you why,” said Black. “Because you never did

anything for anyone unless you could see what was in

it for you. Voldemort’s been in hiding for fifteen years,

they say he’s half dead. You weren’t about to commit

murder right under Albus Dumbledore’s nose, for a

wreck of a wizard who’d lost all of his power, were

you? You’d want to be quite sure he was the biggest

bully in the playground before you went back to him,

wouldn’t you? Why else did you find a wizard family

to take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren’t

you, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained

strength, and it was safe to rejoin him. ...”

Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several

times. He seemed to have lost the ability to talk.

“Er — Mr. Black — Sirius?” said Hermione.

 

Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared

at Hermione as though he had never seen anything

quite like her.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how — how did you get

out of Azkaban, if you didn’t use Dark Magic?”

“Thank you!” gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at

her. “Exactly! Precisely what I — ”

But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was

frowning slightly at Hermione, but not as though he

were annoyed with her. He seemed to be pondering

his answer.

“I don’t know how I did it,” he said slowly. “I think the

only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was

innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the

dementors couldn’t suck it out of me ... but it kept me

sane and knowing who I am . . . helped me keep my

powers ... so when it all became . . . too much ... I

could transform in my cell . . . become a dog.

Dementors can’t see, you know. ...” He swallowed.

“They feel their way toward people by feeding off their

emotions. ... They could tell that my feelings were less

— less human, less complex when I was a dog ... but

they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind

like everyone else in there, so it didn’t trouble them.

But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of

driving them away from me without a wand. ...

“But then I saw Peter in that picture ... I realized he

was at Hogwarts with Harry . . . perfectly positioned to

act, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side

was gathering strength again. ...”

Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing

noiselessly, but staring all the while at Black as

though hypnotized.

 

"... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of

allies ... and to deliver the last Potter to them. If he

gave them Harry, who’d dare say he’d betrayed Lord

Voldemort? He’d be welcomed back with honors. ...

“So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one

who knew Peter was still alive. ...”

Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs.

Weasley. “The guards say he’s been talking in his

sleep ... always the same words ... ‘He’s at Hog warts.’

“It was as if someone had lit a fire in my head, and

the dementors couldn’t destroy it. ... It wasn’t a

happy feeling ... it was an obsession . . . but it gave me

strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they

opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as

a dog. ... It’s so much harder for them to sense

animal emotions that they were confused. ... I was

thin, very thin . . . thin enough to slip through the

bars. ... I swam as a dog back to the mainland. ... I

journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts

grounds as a dog. I’ve been living in the forest ever

since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of

course. You fly as well as your father did, Harry. ...”

He looked at Harry, who did not look away.

“Believe me,” croaked Black. “Believe me, Harry. I

never betrayed James and Lily. I would have died

before I betrayed them.”

And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight

to speak, he nodded.

“No!”

 

Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry’s

nod had been his own death sentence. He shuffled

forward on his knees, groveling, his hands clasped in

front of him as though praying.

“Sirius — it’s me ... it’s Peter ... your friend ... you

wouldn’t ...”

Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.

“There’s enough filth on my robes without you

touching them,” said Black.

“Remus!” Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin

instead, writhing imploringly in front of him. “You

don’t believe this ... wouldn’t Sirius have told you

they’d changed the plan?”

“Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,” said Lupin. “I

assume that’s why you didn’t tell me, Sirius?” he said

casually over Pettigrew’s head.

“Forgive me, Remus,” said Black.

“Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,” said Lupin, who was

now rolling up his sleeves. “And will you, in turn,

forgive me for believing you were the spy?”

“Of course,” said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted

across his gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his

sleeves. “Shall we kill him together?”

“Yes, I think so,” said Lupin grimly.

“You wouldn’t ... you won’t... ,” gasped Pettigrew. And

he scrambled around to Ron.

 

“Ron ... haven’t I been a good friend ... a good pet?

You won’t let them kill me, Ron, will you ... you’re on

my side, aren’t you?”

But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost

revulsion.

“I let you sleep in my bed\” he said.

“Kind boy ... kind master ...” Pettigrew crawled toward

Ron, “you won’t let them do it. ... I was your rat. ... I

was a good pet. ...”

“If you made a better rat than a human, it’s not much

to boast about, Peter,” said Black harshly. Ron, going

still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of

Pettigrew’s reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees,

staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione’s

robes.

“Sweet girl ... clever girl ... you — you won’t let them.

... Help me. ...”

Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew’s

clutching hands and backed away against the wall,

looking horrified.

Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and turned

his head slowly toward Harry.

“Harry ... Harry ... you look just like your father ...

just like him. ...”

“HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?” roared Black.

“HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK

ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?”

“Harry,” whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him,

hands outstretched. “Harry, James wouldn’t have

 

wanted me killed. ... James would have understood,

Harry ... he would have shown me mercy. ...”

Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized

Pettigrew’s shoulders, and threw him backward onto

the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror, staring

up at them.

“You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,” said Black,

who was shaking too. “Do you deny it?”

Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch,

like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor.

“Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark

Lord . . . you have no idea ... he has weapons you can’t

imagine. ... I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave

like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to

happen. ... He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me —

“DONT LIE!” bellowed Black. “YOU’D BEEN PASSING

INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY

AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!”

“He — he was taking over everywhere!” gasped

Pettigrew. “Wh — what was there to be gained by

refusing him?”

“What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil

wizard who has ever existed?” said Black, with a

terribly fury in his face. “Only innocent lives, Peter!”

“You don’t understand!” whined Pettigrew. “He would

have killed me, Sirius!”

“THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!” roared Black.

“DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS

WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!”

 

Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands

raised.

“You should have realized,” said Lupin quietly, “if

Voldemort didn’t kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter.”

Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned

to the wall.

“NO!” Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in

front of Pettigrew, facing the wands. “You can’t kill

him,” he said breathlessly. “You can’t.”

Black and Lupin both looked staggered.

“Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no

parents,” Black snarled. “This cringing bit of filth

would have seen you die too, without turning a hair.

You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more to

him than your whole family.”

“I know,” Harry panted. “We’ll take him up to the

castle. We’ll hand him over to the dementors. ... He

can go to Azkaban ... but don’t kill him.”

“Harry!” gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms

around Harry’s knees. “You — thank you — it’s more

than I deserve — thank you — ”

“Get off me,” Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew’s hands

off him in disgust. “I’m not doing this for you. I’m

doing it because — I don’t reckon my dad would’ve

wanted them to become killers — just for you.”

No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew,

whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched

his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at each

other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their

wands.

 

“You’re the only person who has the right to decide,

Harry,” said Black. “But think ... think what he did.

“He can go to Azkaban,” Harry repeated. “If anyone

deserves that place, he does. ...”

Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him.

“Very well,” said Lupin. “Stand aside, Harry.”

Harry hesitated.

“I’m going to tie him up,” said Lupin. “That’s all, I

swear.”

Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from

Lupin’s wand this time, and next moment, Pettigrew

was wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged.

“But if you transform, Peter,” growled Black, his own

wand pointing at Pettigrew too, “we will kill you. You

agree, Harry?”

Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor

and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him.

“Right,” said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. “Ron, I

can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey,

so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we

can get you to the hospital wing.”

He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron’s leg

with his wand, and muttered, “Ferula.” Bandages

spun up Ron’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.

Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight

gingerly on the leg and didn’t wince.

“That’s better,” he said. “Thanks.”

 

“What about Professor Snape?” said Hermione in a

small voice, looking down at Snape’s prone figure.

“There’s nothing seriously wrong with him,” said

Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse.

“You were just a little — overenthusiastic. Still out

cold. Er — perhaps it will be best if we don’t revive

him until we’re safely back in the castle. We can take

him like this. ...”

He muttered, “Mobilicorpus.” As though invisible

strings were tied to Snape’s wrists, neck, and knees,

he was pulled into a standing position, head still

lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung

a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling.

Lupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it

safely into his pocket.

“And two of us should be chained to this,” said Black,

nudging Pettigrew with his toe. “Just to make sure.”

“I’ll do it,” said Lupin.

“And me,” said Ron savagely, limping forward.

Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon

Pettigrew was upright again, left arm chained to

Lupin’s right, right arm to Ron’s left. Ron’s face was

set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers’s true identity

as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the

bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush

tail held jauntily high.

 

THE DEMENTOR’S KISS

Harry had never been part of a stranger group.

Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin,

Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like entrants in

a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting

creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they

descended, held up by his own wand, which was

being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and Hermione

brought up the rear.

Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin,

Pettigrew, and Ron had to turn sideways to manage

it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered with his wand.

Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the

tunnel in single file. Crookshanks was still in the

lead. Harry went right after Black, who was still

making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept

bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry

had the impression Black was making no effort to

prevent this.

 

“You know what this means?” Black said abruptly to

Harry as they made their slow progress along the

tunnel. “Turning Pettigrew in?”

“You’re free,” said Harry.

“Yes ... ,” said Black. “But I’m also — I don’t know if

anyone ever told you — I’m your godfather.”

“Yeah, I knew that,” said Harry.

“Well ... your parents appointed me your guardian,”

said Black stiffly. “If anything happened to them ...”

Harry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he

meant?

“I’ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with

your aunt and uncle,” said Black. “But ... well ...

think about it. Once my name’s cleared ... if you

wanted a ... a different home ...”

Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry’s

stomach.

“What — live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking

his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling.

“Leave the Dursleys?”

“Of course, I thought you wouldn’t want to,” said

Black quickly. “I understand, I just thought I’d — ”

“Are you insane?” said Harry, his voice easily as

croaky as Black’s. “Of course I want to leave the

Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move

in?”

 

Black turned right around to look at him; Snape’s

head was scraping the ceiling but Black didn’t seem

to care.

“You want to?” he said. “You mean it?”

“Yeah, I mean it!” said Harry.

Black’s gaunt face broke into the first true smile

Harry had seen upon it. The difference it made was

startling, as though a person ten years younger were

shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he

was recognizable as the man who had laughed at

Harry’s parents’ wedding.

They did not speak again until they had reached the

end of the tunnel. Crookshanks darted up first; he

had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the

trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered

upward without any sound of savaging branches.

Black saw Snape up through the hole, then stood

back for Harry and Hermione to pass. At last, all of

them were out.

The grounds were very dark now; the only light came

from the distant windows of the castle. Without a

word, they set off. Pettigrew was still wheezing and

occasionally whimpering. Harry’s mind was buzzing.

He was going to leave the Dursleys. He was going to

live with Sirius Black, his parents’ best friend. ... He

felt dazed. ... What would happen when he told the

Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they’d

seen on television... !

“One wrong move, Peter,” said Lupin threateningly

ahead. His wand was still pointed sideways at

Pettigrew’s chest.

 

Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle

lights growing slowly larger. Snape was still drifting

weirdly ahead of Black, his chin bumping on his

chest. And then —

A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on

the ground. Their party was bathed in moonlight.

Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who

had stopped abruptly. Black froze. He flung out one

arm to make Harry and Hermione stop.

Harry could see Lupin’s silhouette. He had gone rigid.

Then his limbs began to shake.

“Oh, my — ” Hermione gasped. “He didn’t take his

potion tonight! He’s not safe!”

“Run,” Black whispered. “Run. Now.”

But Harry couldn’t run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew

and Lupin. He leapt forward but Black caught him

around the chest and threw him back.

“Leave it to me — RUN!”

There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin’s head was

lengthening. So was his body. His shoulders were

hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and

hands, which were curling into clawed paws.

Crookshanks’s hair was on end again; he was backing

away —

As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius

disappeared from Harry’s side. He had transformed.

The enormous, bearlike dog bounded forward. As the

werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding

it, the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it

 

backward, away from Ron and Pettigrew. They were

locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other —

Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon

the battle to notice anything else. It was Hermione’s

scream that alerted him —

Pettigrew had dived for Lupin’s dropped wand. Ron,

unsteady on his bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang,

a burst of light — and Ron lay motionless on the

ground. Another bang — Crookshanks flew into the

air and back to the earth in a heap.

“ ExpelliarmusV’ Harry yelled, pointing his own wand

at Pettigrew; Lupin’s wand flew high into the air and

out of sight. “Stay where you are!” Harry shouted,

running forward.

Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his

bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron’s

outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the

grass.

There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned

to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into

the forest —

“Sirius, he’s gone, Pettigrew transformed!” Harry

yelled.

Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his

muzzle and back, but at Harry’s words he scrambled

up again, and in an instant, the sound of his paws

faded to silence as he pounded away across the

grounds.

Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron.

 

“What did he do to him?” Hermione whispered. Ron’s

eyes were only half-closed, his mouth hung open; he

was definitely alive, they could hear him breathing,

but he didn’t seem to recognize them.

“I don’t know. ...”

Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin

both gone . . . they had no one but Snape for company,

still hanging, unconscious, in midair.

“We’d better get them up to the castle and tell

someone,” said Harry, pushing his hair out of his

eyes, trying to think straight. Come — ”

But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they

heard a yelping, a whining: a dog in pain. ...

“Sirius,” Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.

He had a moment’s indecision, but there was nothing

they could do for Ron at the moment, and by the

sound of it, Black was in trouble —

Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him.

The yelping seemed to be coming from the ground

near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward it, and

Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing

what it must mean —

The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the

lakeshore, they saw why — Sirius had turned back

into a man. He was crouched on all fours, his hands

over his head.

“iVooo,” he moaned. “Noooo ... please. ...”

And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a

hundred of them, gliding in a black mass around the

 

lake toward them. He spun around, the familiar, icy

cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure

his vision; more were appearing out of the darkness

on every side; they were encircling them. ...

“Hermione, think of something happy!” Harry yelled,

raising his wand, blinking furiously to try and clear

his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint

screaming that had started inside it —

I’m going to live with my godfather. I’m leaving the

Dursleys.

He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black,

and began to chant: “Expecto patronum). Expecto

patronum).”

Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless

on the ground, pale as death.

Hell be all right. I’m going to go and live with him.

“Expecto patronum). Hermione, help me! Expecto

patronum).”

“Expecto — ” Hermione whispered, “expecto — expecto

But she couldn’t do it. The dementors were closing in,

barely ten feet from them. They formed a solid wall

around Harry and Hermione, and were getting closer.

“EXPECTO PATRONUM” Harry yelled, trying to blot

the screaming from his ears. “EXPECTO PATRONUM.”

A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered

like mist before him. At the same moment, Harry felt

 

Hermione collapse next to him. He was alone ...

completely alone. ...

“Expecto — expecto patronum — ”

Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was

clouding his eyes. With a huge effort, he fought to

remember — Sirius was innocent — innocent — We’ll

be okay — I’m going to live with him —

“ Expecto patronum J” he gasped.

By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, he saw a

dementor halt, very close to him. It couldn’t walk

through the cloud of silver mist Harry had conjured.

A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It

made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus

aside.

“No — no — ” Harry gasped. “He’s innocent ... expecto

— expecto patronum — ”

He could feel them watching him, hear their rattling

breath like an evil wind around him. The nearest

dementor seemed to be considering him. Then it

raised both its rotting hands — and lowered its hood.

Where there should have been eyes, there was only

thin, gray scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty

sockets. But there was a mouth ... a gaping,

shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a

death rattle.

A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn’t

move or speak. His Patronus flickered and died.

White fog was blinding him. He had to fight ... expecto

patronum ... he couldn’t see ... and in the distance, he

heard the familiar screaming . . . expecto patronum . . .

 

he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his arm ...

they weren’t going to take him. ...

But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly

attached themselves around Harry’s neck. They were

forcing his face upward. ... He could feel its breath. ...

It was going to get rid of him first. ... He could feel its

putrid breath. . . . His mother was screaming in his

ears. ... She was going to be the last thing he ever

heard —

And then, through the fog that was drowning him, he

thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and

brighter. ... He felt himself fall forward onto the grass.

... Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking,

Harry opened his eyes. The dementor must have

released him. The blinding light was illuminating the

grass around him. ... The screaming had stopped, the

cold was ebbing away. . . .

Something was driving the dementors back. ... It was

circling around him and Black and Hermione. ... They

were leaving. ... The air was warm again. ...

With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry

raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid

the light, galloping away across the lake. ... Eyes

blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it

was. ... It was as bright as a unicorn. ... Fighting to

stay conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it

reached the opposite shore. For a moment, Harry

saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back

. . . raising his hand to pat it . . . someone who looked

strangely familiar ... but it couldn’t be ...

Harry didn’t understand. He couldn’t think anymore.

He felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head

hit the ground as he fainted.

 

HERMIONE’S SECRET

“Shocking business ... shocking ... miracle none of

them died . . . never heard the like ... by thunder, it

was lucky you were there, Snape. ...”

“Thank you, Minister.”

“Order of Merlin, Second Class, I’d say. First Class, if

I can wangle it!”

“Thank you very much indeed, Minister.”

“Nasty cut you’ve got there. ... Black’s work, I

suppose?”

“As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and

Granger, Minister. ...”

“iVo!”

“Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A

Confundus Charm, to judge by their behavior. They

seemed to think there was a possibility he was

 

innocent. They weren’t responsible for their actions.

On the other hand, their interference might have

permitted Black to escape. ... They obviously thought

they were going to catch Black single-handed. They’ve

got away with a great deal before now. ... I’m afraid

it’s given them a rather high opinion of themselves ...

and of course Potter has always been allowed an

extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster —

“Ah, well, Snape ... Harry Potter, you know ... we’ve

all got a bit of a blind spot where he’s concerned.”

“And yet — is it good for him to be given so much

special treatment? Personally, I try and treat him like

any other student. And any other student would be

suspended — at the very least — for leading his

friends into such danger. Consider, Minister —

against all school rules — after all the precautions

put in place for his protection — out-of-bounds, at

night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer —

and I have reason to believe he has been visiting

Hogsmeade illegally too — ”

“Well, well ... we shall see, Snape, we shall see. ... The

boy has undoubtedly been foolish. ...”

Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt

very groggy. The words he was hearing seemed to be

traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain, so

that it was difficult to understand. ... His limbs felt

like lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift. ... He wanted to

lie here, on this comfortable bed, forever. ...

“What amazes me most is the behavior of the

dementors ... you’ve really no idea what made them

retreat, Snape?”

 

“No, Minister ... by the time I had come ’round they

were heading back to their positions at the entrances.

“Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl

“All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound

and gagged Black, naturally, conjured stretchers, and

brought them all straight back to the castle.”

There was a pause. Harry’s brain seemed to be

moving a little faster, and as it did, a gnawing

sensation grew in the pit of his stomach. ...

He opened his eyes.

Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had

removed his glasses. He was lying in the dark hospital

wing. At the very end of the ward, he could make out

Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a

bed. Harry squinted. Ron’s red hair was visible

beneath Madam Pomfrey’s arm.

Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed

to his right lay Hermione. Moonlight was falling

across her bed. Her eyes were open too. She looked

petrified, and when she saw that Harry was awake,

pressed a finger to her lips, then pointed to the

hospital wing door. It was ajar, and the voices of

Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it

from the corridor outside.

Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the

dark ward to Harry’s bed. He turned to look at her.

She was carrying the largest block of chocolate he

had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small

boulder.

 

“Ah, you’re awake!” she said briskly. She placed the

chocolate on Harry’s bedside table and began

breaking it apart with a small hammer.

“How’s Ron?” said Harry and Hermione together.

“He’ll live,” said Madam Pomfrey grimly. “As for you

two ... you’ll be staying here until I’m satisfied you’re

— Potter, what do you think you’re doing?”

Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and

picking up his wand.

“I need to see the headmaster,” he said.

“Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, “it’s all

right. They’ve got Black. He’s locked away upstairs.

The dementors will be performing the kiss any

moment now — ”

“WHAT?”

Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the

same. But his shout had been heard in the corridor

outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and Snape had

entered the ward.

“Harry, Harry, what’s this?” said Fudge, looking

agitated. “You should be in bed — has he had any

chocolate?” he asked Madam Pomfrey anxiously.

“Minister, listen!” Harry said. “Sirius Black’s innocent!

Peter Pettigrew faked his own death! We saw him

tonight! You can’t let the dementors do that thing to

Sirius, he’s — ”

But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile

on his face.

 

“Harry, Harry, you’re very confused, you’ve been

through a dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now, we’ve

got everything under control. ...”

“YOU HAVEN’T!” Harry yelled. “YOU VE GOT THE

WRONG MAN!”

“Minister, listen, please,” Hermione said; she had

hurried to Harry’s side and was gazing imploringly

into Fudge’s face. “I saw him too. It was Ron’s rat,

he’s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and — ”

“You see, Minister?” said Snape. “Confunded, both of

them. ... Black’s done a very good job on them. ...”

“WE’RE NOT CONFUNDED!” Harry roared.

“Minister! Professor!” said Madam Pomfrey angrily. “I

must insist that you leave. Potter is my patient, and

he should not be distressed!”

“I’m not distressed, I’m trying to tell them what

happened!” Harry said furiously. “If they’d just listen

But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk

of chocolate into Harry’s mouth; he choked, and she

seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed.

“Now, please, Minister, these children need care.

Please leave — ”

The door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry

swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great

difficulty and got up again.

“Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black — ”

 

“For heaven’s sake!” said Madam Pomfrey

hysterically. “Is this a hospital wing or not?

Headmaster, I must insist — ”

“My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr.

Potter and Miss Granger,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I

have just been talking to Sirius Black — ”

“I suppose he’s told you the same fairy tale he’s

planted in Potter’s mind?” spat Snape. “Something

about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive — ”

“That, indeed, is Black’s story,” said Dumbledore,

surveying Snape closely through his half-moon

spectacles.

“And does my evidence count for nothing?” snarled

Snape. “Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking

Shack, nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds.”

“That was because you were knocked out, Professor!”

said Hermione earnestly. “You didn’t arrive in time to

hear — ”

“Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!”

“Now, Snape,” said Fudge, startled, “the young lady is

disturbed in her mind, we must make allowances — ”

“I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,”

said Dumbledore abruptly. “Cornelius, Severus,

Poppy — please leave us.”

“Headmaster!” sputtered Madam Pomfrey “They need

treatment, they need rest — ”

“This cannot wait,” said Dumbledore. “I must insist.”

 

Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into

her office at the end of the ward, slamming the door

behind her. Fudge consulted the large gold pocket

watch dangling from his waistcoat.

“The dementors should have arrived by now,” he said.

“Ill go and meet them. Dumbledore, 111 see you

upstairs.”

He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape,

but Snape hadn’t moved.

“You surely don’t believe a word of Black’s story?”

Snape whispered, his eyes fixed on Dumbledore ’s

face.

“I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,”

Dumbledore repeated.

Snape took a step toward Dumbledore.

“Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the

age of sixteen,” he breathed. “You haven’t forgotten

that, Headmaster? You haven’t forgotten that he once

tried to kill me?”

“My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,” said

Dumbledore quietly.

Snape turned on his heel and marched through the

door Fudge was still holding. It closed behind them,

and Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione. They

both burst into speech at the same time.

“Professor, Black’s telling the truth — we saw

Pettigrew — ”

“ — he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a

werewolf — ”

 

“ — he’s a rat — ”

“ — Pettigrew’s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off

“ — Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn’t Sirius — ”

But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of

explanations.

“It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not

interrupt me, because there is very little time,” he

said quietly. “There is not a shred of proof to support

Black’s story, except your word — and the word of

two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince

anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw

Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the

Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters’ Secret-

Keeper.”

“Professor Lupin can tell you — ” Harry said, unable to

stop himself.

“Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest,

unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is

human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse

than dead. I might add that werewolves are so

mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will

count for very little — and the fact that he and Sirius

are old friends — ”

“But — ”

“ Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand

me? You must see that Professor Snape’s version of

events is far more convincing than yours.”

“He hates Sirius,” Hermione said desperately. “All

because of some stupid trick Sirius played on him — ”

 

“Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The

attack on the Fat Lady — entering Gryffindor Tower

with a knife — without Pettigrew, alive or dead, we

have no chance of overturning Sirius’s sentence.”

“But you believe us.”

“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore quietly. “But I have no

power to make other men see the truth, or to overrule

the Minister of Magic. ...”

Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though

the ground beneath him were falling sharply away. He

had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could

solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull

some amazing solution out of the air. But no . . . their

last hope was gone.

“What we need,” said Dumbledore slowly, and his

light blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione, “is

more time.”

“But — ” Hermione began. And then her eyes became

very round. “OH!”

“Now, pay attention,” said Dumbledore, speaking very

low, and very clearly. “Sirius is locked in Professor

Flitwick’s office on the seventh floor. Thirteenth

window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes

well, you will be able to save more than one innocent

life tonight. But remember this, both of you: you must

not be seen. Miss Granger, you know the law — you

know what is at stake. ... You — must — not — be —

seen.”

Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.

Dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back

as he reached the door.

 

“I am going to lock you in. It is — ” he consulted his

watch, “five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three

turns should do it. Good luck.”

“Good luck?” Harry repeated as the door closed

behind Dumbledore. “Three turns? What’s he talking

about? What are we supposed to do?”

But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her

robes, pulling from beneath them a very long, very

fine gold chain.

“Harry, come here,” she said urgently. “Quick).”

Harry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She

was holding the chain out. He saw a tiny, sparkling

hourglass hanging from it.

“Here — ”

She had thrown the chain around his neck too.

“Ready?” she said breathlessly.

“What are we doing?” Harry said, completely lost.

Hermione turned the hourglass over three times.

The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation

that he was flying very fast, backward. A blur of

colors and shapes rushed past him, his ears were

pounding, he tried to yell but couldn’t hear his own

voice —

And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and

everything came into focus again —

He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted

entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was

 

falling across the paved floor from the open front

doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the

chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck.

“Hermione, what — ?”

“In here!” Hermione seized Harry’s arm and dragged

him across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she

opened it, pushed him inside among the buckets and

mops, then slammed the door behind them.

“What — how — Hermione, what happened?”

“We’ve gone back in time,” Hermione whispered,

lifting the chain off Harry’s neck in the darkness.

“Three hours back ...”

Harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard

pinch. It hurt a lot, which seemed to rule out the

possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream.

“But — ”

“Shh! Listen! Someone’s coming! I think — I think it

might be us!”

Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard

door.

“Footsteps across the hall ... yes, I think it’s us going

down to Hagrid’s!”

“Are you telling me,” Harry whispered, “that we’re

here in this cupboard and we’re out there too?”

“Yes,” said Hermione, her ear still glued to the

cupboard door. “I’m sure it’s us. It doesn’t sound like

more than three people ... and we’re walking slowly

because we’re under the Invisibility Cloak — ”

 

She broke off, still listening intently.

“We’ve gone down the front steps. ...”

Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking

desperately anxious, but Harry wanted a few

questions answered.

“Where did you get that hourglass thing?”

“It’s called a Time-Turner,” Hermione whispered, “and

I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day

back. I’ve been using it all year to get to all my

lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I

wouldn’t tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of

letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one.

She had to tell them that I was a model student, and

that I’d never, ever use it for anything except my

studies. ... I’ve been turning it back so I could do

hours over again, that’s how I’ve been doing several

lessons at once, see? But ...

“Harry, I don’t understand what Dumbledore wants us

to do. Why did he tell us to go back three hours?

How’s that going to help Sirius?”

Harry stared at her shadowy face.

“There must be something that happened around now

he wants us to change,” he said slowly. “What

happened? We were walking down to Hagrid’s three

hours ago. ...”

“This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to

Hagrid’s,” said Hermione. “We just heard ourselves

leaving. ...”

Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up

his whole brain in concentration.

 

“Dumbledore just said — just said we could save

more than one innocent life. ...” And then it hit him.

“Hermione, we’re going to save Buckbeak!”

“But — how will that help Sirius?”

“Dumbledore said — he just told us where the

window is — the window of Flitwick’s office! Where

they’ve got Sirius locked up! We’ve got to fly

Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius

can escape on Buckbeak — they can escape together!”

From what Harry could see of Hermione’s face, she

looked terrified.

“If we manage that without being seen, it’ll be a

miracle!”

“Well, we’ve got to try, haven’t we?” said Harry. He

stood up and pressed his ear against the door.

“Doesn’t sound like anyone’s there. ... Come on, let’s

go. ...”

Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall

was deserted. As quietly and quickly as they could,

they darted out of the closet and down the stone

steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the

tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once

more with gold.

“If anyone’s looking out of the window — ” Hermione

squeaked, looking up at the castle behind them.

“Well run for it,” said Harry determinedly. “Straight

into the forest, all right? We’ll have to hide behind a

tree or something and keep a lookout — ”

 

“Okay, but well go around by the greenhouses!” said

Hermione breathlessly. “We need to keep out of sight

of Hagrid’s front door, or well see us! We must be

nearly at Hagrid’s by now!”

Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a

sprint, Hermione behind him. They tore across the

vegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a

moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they

could, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing

toward the shelter of the forest. ...

Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned

around; seconds later, Hermione arrived beside him,

panting.

“Right,” she gasped. “We need to sneak over to

Hagrid’s. ... Keep out of sight, Harry. ...”

They made their way silently through the trees,

keeping to the very edge of the forest. Then, as they

glimpsed the front of Hagrid’s house, they heard a

knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a

wide oak trunk and peered out from either side.

Hagrid had appeared in his doorway, shaking and

white, looking around to see who had knocked. And

Harry heard his own voice.

“It’s us. We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in

and we can take it off.”

“Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered. He stood

back, then shut the door quickly.

“This is the weirdest thing we’ve ever done,” Harry

said fervently.

“Let’s move along a bit,” Hermione whispered. “We

need to get nearer to Buckbeak!”

 

They crept through the trees until they saw the

nervous hippogriff, tethered to the fence around

Hagrid’s pumpkin patch.

“Now?” Harry whispered.

“No!” said Hermione. “If we steal him now, those

Committee people will think Hagrid set him free!

We’ve got to wait until they’ve seen he’s tied outside!”

“That’s going to give us about sixty seconds,” said

Harry. This was starting to seem impossible.

At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china

from inside Hagrid’s cabin.

“That’s Hagrid breaking the milk jug,” Hermione

whispered. “I’m going to find Scabbers in a moment —

Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard

Hermione ’s shriek of surprise.

“Hermione,” said Harry suddenly, “what if we — we

just run in there and grab Pettigrew — ”

“No!” said Hermione in a terrified whisper. “Don’t you

understand? We’re breaking one of the most

important wizarding laws! Nobody’s supposed to

change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we’re

seen — ”

“We’d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!”

“Harry, what do you think you’d do if you saw

yourself bursting into Hagrid’s house?” said

Hermione.

 

“I’d — I’d think I’d gone mad,” said Harry, “or I’d think

there was some Dark Magic going on — ”

“ Exactly ! You wouldn’t understand, you might even

attack yourself! Don’t you see? Professor McGonagall

told me what awful things have happened when

wizards have meddled with time. ... Loads of them

ended up killing their past or future selves by

mistake!”

“Okay!” said Harry. “It was just an idea, I just thought

But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the

castle. Harry moved his head a few inches to get a

clear view of the distant front doors. Dumbledore,

Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the

executioner were coming down the steps.

“We’re about to come out!” Hermione breathed.

And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid’s back door

opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Hermione

walking out of it with Hagrid. It was, without a doubt,

the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind

the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.

“It’s okay, Beaky, it’s okay ... ,” Hagrid said to

Buckbeak. Then he turned to Harry, Ron, and

Hermione. “Go on. Get goin’.”

“Hagrid, we can’t — ”

“Well tell them what really happened — ”

“They can’t kill him — ”

“Go! It’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an’

all!”

 

Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch

throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron.

“Go quick. Don’ listen. ...”

There was a knock on Hagrid’s front door. The

execution party had arrived. Hagrid turned around

and headed back into his cabin, leaving the back door

ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all

around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet

retreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had gone ... but

the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could

now hear what was happening inside the cabin

through the back door.

“Where is the beast?” came the cold voice of Macnair.

“Out — outside,” Hagrid croaked.

Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair’s face

appeared at Hagrid’s window, staring out at

Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.

“We — er — have to read you the official notice of

execution, Hagrid. I’ll make it quick. And then you

and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, you’re

supposed to listen too, that’s procedure — ”

Macnair’s face vanished from the window. It was now

or never.

“Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.”

As Fudge’s voice started again, Harry darted out from

behind his tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin

patch, and approached Buckbeak.

“It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of

Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak,

 

hereafter called the condemned, shall be executed on

the sixth of June at sundown — ”

Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s

fierce orange eyes once more and bowed. Buckbeak

sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again.

Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying

Buckbeak to the fence.

"... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried

out by the Committee’s appointed executioner, Walden

Macnair ...”

“Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on,

we’re going to help you. Quietly ... quietly ...”

"... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here. ...”

Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but

Buckbeak had dug in his front feet.

“Well, let’s get this over with,” said the reedy voice of

the Committee member from inside Hagrid’s cabin.

“Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you stay inside — ”

“No, I — I wan’ ter be with him. ... I don’ wan’ him ter

be alone — ”

Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.

“Buckbeak, move\” Harry hissed.

Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak’s

neck. The hippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings

irritably. They were still ten feet away from the forest,

in plain view of Hagrid’s back door.

“One moment, please, Macnair,” came Dumbledore’s

voice. “You need to sign too.” The footsteps stopped.

 

Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his

beak and walked a little faster.

Hermione ’s white face was sticking out from behind a

tree.

“Harry, hurry!” she mouthed.

Harry could still hear Dumbledore’s voice talking from

within the cabin. He gave the rope another wrench.

Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They had

reached the trees. ...

“Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from

behind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her

weight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked

over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight;

they couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.

“Stop!” he whispered to Hermione. “They might hear

us — ”

Hagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry,

Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the

hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.

Silence . . . then —

“Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee

member. “Where is the beast?”

“It was tied here!” said the executioner furiously. “I

saw it! Just here!”

“How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore. There was a

note of amusement in his voice.

“Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily.

 

There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe.

The executioner seemed to have swung it into the

fence in anger. And then came the howling, and this

time they could hear Hagrid ’s words through his sobs.

“Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he’s gone\ Musta

pulled himself free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!”

Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to

get back to Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened

their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to

stop him.

“Someone untied him!” the executioner was snarling.

“We should search the grounds, the forest — ”

“Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you

really think the thief will have led him away on foot?”

said Dumbledore, still sounding amused. “Search the

skies, if you will. ... Hagrid, I could do with a cup of

tea. Or a large brandy.”

“O’ — o’ course, Professor,” said Hagrid, who sounded

weak with happiness. “Come in, come in. ...”

Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard

footsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner, the

snap of the door, and then silence once more.

“Now what?” whispered Harry, looking around.

“Well have to hide in here,” said Hermione, who

looked very shaken. “We need to wait until they’ve

gone back to the castle. Then we wait until it’s safe to

fly Buckbeak up to Sirius’s window. He won’t be there

for another couple of hours. ... Oh, this is going to be

difficult. ...”

 

She looked nervously over her shoulder into the

depths of the forest. The sun was setting now.

“We’re going to have to move,” said Harry, thinking

hard. “We’ve got to be able to see the Whomping

Willow, or we won’t know what’s going on.”

“Okay,” said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on

Buckbeak’s rope. “But we’ve got to keep out of sight,

Harry, remember. ...”

They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness

falling thickly around them, until they were hidden

behind a clump of trees through which they could

make out the Willow.

“There’s Ron!” said Harry suddenly.

A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its

shout echoed through the still night air.

“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come

here — ”

And then they saw two more figures materialize out of

nowhere. Harry watched himself and Hermione

chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.

“Gotchcd Get off, you stinking cat — ”

“There’s Sirius!” said Harry. The great shape of the

dog had bounded out from the roots of the Willow.

They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize Ron. ...

“Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it?” said Harry,

watching the dog pulling Ron into the roots. “Ouch —

look, I just got walloped by the tree — and so did you

— this is weird — ”

 

The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out

with its lower branches; they could see themselves

darting here and there, trying to reach the trunk. And

then the tree froze.

“That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,” said

Hermione.

“And there we go ... ,” Harry muttered. “We’re in.”

The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move

again. Seconds later, they heard footsteps quite close

by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and the old

Committee member were making their way up to the

castle.

“Right after we’d gone down into the passage!” said

Hermione. “If only Dumbledore had come with us ...”

“Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said Harry

bitterly. “I bet you anything Fudge would’ve told

Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot. ...”

They watched the four men climb the castle steps and

disappear from view. For a few minutes the scene was

deserted. Then —

“Here comes Lupin!” said Harry as they saw another

figure sprinting down the stone steps and haring

toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the sky. Clouds

were obscuring the moon completely.

They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the

ground and prod the knot on the trunk. The tree

stopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the

gap in its roots.

“If he’d only grabbed the cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just

lying there. ...”

 

He turned to Hermione.

“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape’d

never be able to get it and — ”

“Harry, we mustn’t be seen!”

“How can you stand this?” he asked Hermione

fiercely. “Just standing here and watching it happen?”

He hesitated. “I’m going to grab the cloak!”

“Harry, no!”

Hermione seized the back of Harry’s robes not a

moment too soon. Just then, they heard a burst of

song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the castle,

singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as

he walked. A large bottle was swinging from his

hands.

“See?” Hermione whispered. “See what would have

happened? We’ve got to keep out of sight! No,

Buckbeak).”

The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to

Hagrid again; Harry seized his rope too, straining to

hold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid meander

tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak

stopped fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.

Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open

yet again, and Snape came charging out of them,

running toward the Willow.

Harry’s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to

a halt next to the tree, looking around. He grabbed

the cloak and held it up.

 

“Get your filthy hands off it,” Harry snarled under his

breath.

“Shh!”

Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the

tree, prodded the knot, and vanished from view as he

put on the cloak.

“So that’s it,” said Hermione quietly. “We’re all down

there ... and now we’ve just got to wait until we come

back up again. ...”

She took the end of Buckbeak’s rope and tied it

securely around the nearest tree, then sat down on

the dry ground, arms around her knees.

“Harry, there’s something I don’t understand. ... Why

didn’t the dementors get Sirius? I remember them

coming, and then I think I passed out . . . there were

so many of them. ...”

Harry sat down too. He explained what he’d seen;

how, as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth

to Harry’s, a large silver something had come

galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to

retreat.

Hermione ’s mouth was slightly open by the time

Harry had finished.

“But what was it?”

“There’s only one thing it could have been, to make

the dementors go,” said Harry. “A real Patronus. A

powerful one.”

“But who conjured it?”

 

Harry didn’t say anything. He was thinking back to

the person he’d seen on the other bank of the lake. He

knew who he thought it had been . . . but how could it

have been?

“Didn’t you see what they looked like?” said Hermione

eagerly. “Was it one of the teachers?”

“No,” said Harry. “He wasn’t a teacher.”

“But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to

drive all those dementors away. ... If the Patronus

was shining so brightly, didn’t it light him up?

Couldn’t you see — ?”

“Yeah, I saw him,” said Harry slowly. “But ... maybe I

imagined it. ... I wasn’t thinking straight. ... I passed

out right afterward. ...”

“ Who did you think it was?”

“I think — ” Harry swallowed, knowing how strange

this was going to sound. “I think it was my dad.”

Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her

mouth was fully open now. She was gazing at him

with a mixture of alarm and pity.

“Harry, your dad’s — well — dead,” she said quietly.

“I know that,” said Harry quickly.

“You think you saw his ghost?”

“I don’t know ... no ... he looked solid. ...”

“But then — ”

 

“Maybe I was seeing things,” said Harry. “But ... from

what I could see ... it looked like him. ... I’ve got

photos of him. ...”

Hermione was still looking at him as though worried

about his sanity.

“I know it sounds crazy,” said Harry flatly. He turned

to look at Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into

the ground, apparently searching for worms. But he

wasn’t really watching Buckbeak.

He was thinking about his father and about his

father’s three oldest friends ... Moony, Wormtail,

Padfoot, and Prongs. ... Had all four of them been out

on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared

this evening when everyone had thought he was dead.

... Was it so impossible his father had done the same?

Had he been seeing things across the lake? The figure

had been too far away to see distinctly . . . yet he had

felt sure, for a moment, before he’d lost

consciousness. ...

The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The

moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting

clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned toward the

Willow, waiting.

And then, at last, after over an hour . . .

“Here we come!” Hermione whispered.

She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his

head. They saw Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambering

awkwardly out of the hole in the roots . . . followed by

the unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next

came Harry, Hermione, and Black. They all began to

walk toward the castle.

 

Harry’s heart was starting to beat very fast. He

glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud

was going to move aside and show the moon. ...

“Harry,” Hermione muttered as though she knew

exactly what he was thinking, “we’ve got to stay put.

We mustn’t be seen. There’s nothing we can do. ...”

“So we’re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over

again. ...” said Harry quietly.

“How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?”

snapped Hermione. “There’s nothing we can do! We

came back to help Sirius; we’re not supposed to be

doing anything else!”

“ All right'.”

The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw

the tiny figures across the grounds stop. Then they

saw movement —

“There goes Lupin,” Hermione whispered. “He’s

transforming — ”

“Hermione!” said Harry suddenly. “We’ve got to move!”

“We mustn’t, I keep telling you — ”

“Not to interfere! Lupin’s going to run into the forest,

right at us!”

Hermione gasped.

“Quick!” she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak.

“Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going

to hide? The dementors will be coming any moment —

 

“Back to Hagrid’s!” Harry said. “It’s empty now —

come on!”

They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering

along behind them. They could hear the werewolf

howling behind them. ...

The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door,

wrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak

flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them

and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked

loudly.

“Shh, Fang, it’s us!” said Hermione, hurrying over and

scratching his ears to quieten him. “That was really

close!” she said to Harry.

“Yeah ...”

Harry was looking out of the window. It was much

harder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak

seemed very happy to find himself back inside

Hagrid’s house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded

his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good

nap.

“I think I’d better go outside again, you know,” said

Harry slowly. “I can’t see what’s going on — we won’t

know when it’s time — ”

Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.

“I’m not going to try and interfere,” said Harry

quickly. “But if we don’t see what’s going on, how’re

we going to know when it’s time to rescue Sirius?”

“Well ... okay, then ... I’ll wait here with Buckbeak ...

but Harry, be careful — there’s a werewolf out there

— and the dementors — ”

 

Harry stepped outside again and edged around the

cabin. He could hear yelping in the distance. That

meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius. ... He

and Hermione would be running to him any moment.

Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a

kind of drumroll in his chest. ... Whoever had sent

that Patronus would be appearing at any moment. ...

For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front

of Hagrid’s door. You must not be seen. But he didn’t

want to be seen. He wanted to do the seeing. ... He

had to know. . . .

And there were the dementors. They were emerging

out of the darkness from every direction, gliding

around the edges of the lake. ... They were moving

away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank.

... He wouldn’t have to get near them. ...

Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head

except his father. ... If it was him ... if it really was

him ... he had to know, had to find out. ...

The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there

was no sign of anybody. On the opposite bank, he

could see tiny glimmers of silver — his own attempts

at a Patronus —

There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry

threw himself behind it, peering desperately through

the leaves. On the opposite bank, the glimmers of

silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified

excitement shot through him — any moment now —

“Come on!” he muttered, staring about. “Where are

you? Dad, come on — ”

 

But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the

circle of dementors across the lake. One of them was

lowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to

appear — but no one was coming to help this time —

And then it hit him — he understood. He hadn’t seen

his father — he had seen himself —

Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and

pulled out his wand.

“EXPECTO PATRONUM ” he yelled.

And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless

cloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal.

He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was. It

looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away

from him, across the black surface of the lake. He

saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming

dementors. ... Now it was galloping around and

around the black shapes on the ground, and the

dementors were falling back, scattering, retreating

into the darkness. ... They were gone.

The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward

Harry across the still surface of the water. It wasn’t a

horse. It wasn’t a unicorn, either. It was a stag. It was

shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming

back to him. ...

It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on

the soft ground as it stared at Harry with its large,

silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its antlered head. And

Harry realized . . .

“Prongs,” he whispered.

But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the

creature, it vanished.

 

Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with

a great leap of his heart, he heard hooves behind him

— he whirled around and saw Hermione dashing

toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her.

“What did you do?” she said fiercely. “You said you

were only going to keep a lookout!”

“I just saved all our lives ... ,” said Harry. “Get behind

here — behind this bush — I’ll explain.”

Hermione listened to what had just happened with

her mouth open yet again.

“Did anyone see you?”

“Yes, haven’t you been listening? I saw me but I

thought I was my dad! It’s okay!”

“Harry, I can’t believe it. ... You conjured up a

Patronus that drove away all those dementors! That’s

very, very advanced magic. ...”

“I knew I could do it this time,” said Harry, “because

I’d already done it. ... Does that make sense?”

“I don’t know — Harry, look at Snape!”

Together they peered around the bush at the other

bank. Snape had regained consciousness. He was

conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of

Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth

stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating

at his side. Then, wand held out in front of him, he

moved them away toward the castle.

“Right, it’s nearly time,” said Hermione tensely,

looking at her watch. “We’ve got about forty-five

minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the

 

hospital wing. We’ve got to rescue Sirius and get back

into the ward before anybody realizes we’re missing.

They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in

the lake, while the bush next to them whispered in

the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms

again.

“D’you reckon he’s up there yet?” said Harry,

checking his watch. He looked up at the castle and

began counting the windows to the right of the West

Tower.

“Look!” Hermione whispered. “Who’s that? Someone’s

coming back out of the castle!”

Harry stared through the darkness. The man was

hurrying across the grounds, toward one of the

entrances. Something shiny glinted in his belt.

“Macnair!” said Harry. “The executioner! He’s gone to

get the dementors! This is it, Hermione — ”

Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak’s back and

Harry gave her a leg up. Then he placed his foot on

one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up

in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s rope back over

his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like

reins.

“Ready?” he whispered to Hermione. “You’d better

hold on to me — ”

He nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels.

Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry

gripped his flanks with his knees, feeling the great

wings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione was

 

holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could

hear her muttering, “Oh, no — I don’t like this — oh, I

really don’t like this — ”

Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding

quietly toward the upper floors of the castle. ... Harry

pulled hard on the left-hand side of the rope, and

Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the

windows flashing past —

“Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he

could.

Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at

a stop, unless you counted the fact that they kept

rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat

his wings to remain airborne.

“He’s there!” Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose

up beside the window. He reached out, and as

Buckbeak’s wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the

glass.

Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt

from his chair, hurried to the window and tried to

open it, but it was locked.

“Stand back!” Hermione called to him, and she took

out her wand, still gripping the back of Harry’s robes

with her left hand.

“Alohomoral”

The window sprang open.

“How — how — ?” said Black weakly, staring at the

hippogriff.

 

“Get on — there’s not much time,” said Harry,

gripping Buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek

neck to hold him steady. “You’ve got to get out of here

— the dementors are coming — Macnair’s gone to get

them.”

Black placed a hand on either side of the window

frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it. It

was very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, he had

managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak’s back and

pull himself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione.

“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope.

“Up to the tower — come on!”

The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and

they were soaring upward again, high as the top of

the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a clatter on

the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him

at once.

“Sirius, you’d better go, quick,” Harry panted. “They’ll

reach Flitwick’s office any moment, they’ll find out

you’re gone.”

Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.

“What happened to the other boy? Ron?” croaked

Sirius.

“He’s going to be okay. He’s still out of it, but Madam

Pomfrey says shell be able to make him better. Quick

- go

But Black was still staring down at Harry.

“How can I ever thank — ”

“GO!” Harry and Hermione shouted together.

 

Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.

“Well see each other again,” he said. “You are — truly

your father’s son, Harry. ...”

He squeezed Buckbeak’s sides with his heels. Harry

and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings

rose once more. ... The hippogriff took off into the air.

. . . He and his rider became smaller and smaller as

Harry gazed after them ... then a cloud drifted across

the moon. ... They were gone.

 

OWL POST AGAIN

“Harry!”

Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her

watch. “We’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back

down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us

— before Dumbledore locks the door — ”

“Okay,” said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky,

“let’s go. ...”

They slipped through the doorway behind them and

down a tightly spiraling stone staircase. As they

reached the bottom of it, they heard voices. They

flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It

sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking

quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase.

"... only hope Dumbledore ’s not going to make

difficulties,” Snape was saying. “The Kiss will be

performed immediately?”

 

“As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This

whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing. I

can’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to

informing the Daily Prophet that we’ve got him at last.

...I daresay they’ll want to interview you, Snape ...

and once young Harry’s back in his right mind, I

expect he’ll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you

saved him. ...”

Harry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of

Snape’s smirk as he and Fudge passed Harry and

Hermione’s hiding place. Their footsteps died away.

Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make

sure they’d really gone, then started to run in the

opposite direction. Down one staircase, then another,

along a new corridor — then they heard a cackling

ahead.

“Peeves\” Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione’s wrist.

“In here!”

They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just

in time. Peeves seemed to be bouncing along the

corridor in boisterous good spirits, laughing his head

off.

“Oh, he’s horrible,” whispered Hermione, her ear to

the door. “I bet he’s all excited because the dementors

are going to finish off Sirius. ...” She checked her

watch. “Three minutes, Harry!”

They waited until Peeves ’s gloating voice had faded

into the distance, then slid back out of the room and

broke into a run again.

“Hermione — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back

inside — before Dumbledore locks the door?” Harry

panted.

 

“I don’t want to think about it!” Hermione moaned,

checking her watch again. “One minute!”

They had reached the end of the corridor with the

hospital wing entrance. “Okay — I can hear

Dumbledore,” said Hermione tensely. “Come on,

Harry!”

They crept along the corridor. The door opened.

Dumbledore ’s back appeared.

“I am going to lock you in,” they heard him saying. “It

is five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns

should do it. Good luck.”

Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door,

and took out his wand to magically lock it. Panicking,

Harry and Hermione ran forward. Dumbledore looked

up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver

mustache. “Well?” he said quietly.

“We did it!” said Harry breathlessly. “Sirius has gone,

on Buckbeak. ...”

Dumbledore beamed at them.

“Well done. I think — ” He listened intently for any

sound within the hospital wing. “Yes, I think you’ve

gone too — get inside — I’ll lock you in — ”

Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the

dormitory. It was empty except for Ron, who was still

lying motionless in the end bed. As the lock clicked

behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their

own beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back

under her robes. A moment later, Madam Pomfrey

came striding back out of her office.

 

“Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to

look after my patients now?”

She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione

thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly.

Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they

ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and

Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves

jangling. ... And then, as they both took a fourth piece

of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a

distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above

them. ...

“What was that?” said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.

Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and

louder. Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door.

“Really — they’ll wake everybody up! What do they

think they’re doing?”

Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying.

They were drawing nearer —

“He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should

have left somebody in the room with him. When this

gets out — ”

“HE DIDNT DISAPPARATE!” Snape roared, now very

close at hand. “YOU CANT APPARATE OR

DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS — HAS —

SOMETHING — TO — DO — WITH — POTTER!”

“Severus — be reasonable — Harry has been locked

up-”

BAM.

The door of the hospital wing burst open.

 

Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the

ward. Dumbledore alone looked calm. Indeed, he

looked as though he was quite enjoying himself.

Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.

“OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed. “WHAT DID

YOU DO?”

“Professor Snape!” shrieked Madam Pomfrey. “Control

yourself!”

“See here, Snape, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This

door’s been locked, we just saw — ”

“THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape

howled, pointing at Harry and Hermione. His face was

twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.

“Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You’re talking

nonsense!”

“YOU DONT KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape. “HE

DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT — ”

“That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly.

“Think about what you are saying. This door has been

locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. Madam

Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?”

“Of course not!” said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. “I

would have heard them!”

“Well, there you have it, Severus,” said Dumbledore

calmly. “Unless you are suggesting that Harry and

Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I’m

afraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further.”

Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who

looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior, to

 

Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind his

glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind

him, and stormed out of the ward.

“Fellow seems quite unbalanced,” said Fudge, staring

after him. “I’d watch out for him if I were you,

Dumbledore.”

“Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said Dumbledore quietly.

“He’s just suffered a severe disappointment.”

“He’s not the only one!” puffed Fudge. “The Daily

Prophet’s going to have a field day! We had Black

cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet

again! All it needs now is for the story of that

hippogriff’s escape to get out, and I’ll be a

laughingstock! Well ... I’d better go and notify the

Ministry. ...”

“And the dementors?” said Dumbledore. “They’ll be

removed from the school, I trust?”

“Oh yes, they’ll have to go,” said Fudge, running his

fingers distractedly through his hair. “Never dreamed

they’d attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent

boy. ... Completely out of control ... no, I’ll have them

packed off back to Azkaban tonight. ... Perhaps we

should think about dragons at the school entrance.

“Hagrid would like that,” said Dumbledore, smiling at

Harry and Hermione. As he and Fudge left the

dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to the door and

locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she

headed back to her office.

There was a low moan from the other end of the ward.

Ron had woken up. They could see him sitting up,

rubbing his head, looking around.

 

“What — what happened?” he groaned. “Harry? Why

are we in here? Where’s Sirius? Where’s Lupin?

What’s going on?”

Harry and Hermione looked at each other.

“You explain,” said Harry, helping himself to some

more chocolate.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital

wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost

deserted castle. The sweltering heat and the end of

the exams meant that everyone was taking full

advantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron

nor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and

Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about

the extraordinary events of the previous night and

wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now.

Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving

its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the

thread of the conversation as he looked across to the

opposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him

from there just last night. ...

A shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a

very bleary-eyed Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with

one of his tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs and

beaming down at them.

“Know I shouldn’ feel happy, after wha’ happened las’

night,” he said. “I mean, Black escapin’ again, an’

everythin’ — but guess what?”

“What?” they said, pretending to look curious.

“Beaky! He escaped! He’s free! Bin celebratin’ all

night!”

 

“That’s wonderful!” said Hermione, giving Ron a

reproving look because he looked as though he was

close to laughing.

“Yeah ... can’t’ve tied him up properly,” said Hagrid,

gazing happily out over the grounds. “I was worried

this mornin’, mind ... thought he mighta met

Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he

never ate anythin’ las’ night. ...”

“What?” said Harry quickly.

“Blimey, haven’ yeh heard?” said Hagrid, his smile

fading a little. He lowered his voice, even though there

was nobody in sight. “Er — Snape told all the

Slytherins this mornin’. ... Thought everyone ’d know

by now ... Professor Lupin’s a werewolf, see. An’ he

was loose on the grounds las’ night. ... He’s packin’

now, o’ course.”

“He’s packing?” said Harry, alarmed. “Why?”

“Leavin’, isn’ he?” said Hagrid, looking surprised that

Harry had to ask. “Resigned firs’ thing this mornin’.

Says he can’t risk it happenin’ again.”

Harry scrambled to his feet.

“I’m going to see him,” he said to Ron and Hermione.

“But if he’s resigned — ”

“ — doesn’t sound like there’s anything we can do — ”

“I don’t care. I still want to see him. I’ll meet you back

here.”

Lupin’s office door was open. He had already packed

most of his things. The grindylow’s empty tank stood

 

next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and

nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his

desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the

door.

“I saw you coming,” said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to

the parchment he had been poring over. It was the

Marauder’s Map.

“I just saw Hagrid,” said Harry. “And he said you’d

resigned. It’s not true, is it?”

“I’m afraid it is,” said Lupin. He started opening his

desk drawers and taking out the contents.

“Why?” said Harry. “The Ministry of Magic don’t think

you were helping Sirius, do they?”

Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.

“No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince

Fudge that I was trying to save your lives.” He sighed.

“That was the final straw for Severus. I think the loss

of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he — er —

accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning

at breakfast.”

“You’re not leaving just because of that!” said Harry.

Lupin smiled wryly.

“This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from

parents. ... They will not want a werewolf teaching

their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their

point. I could have bitten any of you. ... That must

never happen again.”

“You’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts

teacher we’ve ever had!” said Harry. “Don’t go!”

 

Lupin shook his head and didn’t speak. He carried on

emptying his drawers. Then, while Harry was trying

to think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin

said, “From what the headmaster told me this

morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. If

I’m proud of anything I’ve done this year, it’s how

much you’ve learned. ... Tell me about your

Patronus.”

“How d’you know about that?” said Harry, distracted.

“What else could have driven the dementors back?”

Harry told Lupin what had happened. When he’d

finished, Lupin was smiling again.

“Yes, your father was always a stag when he

transformed,” he said. “You guessed right ... that’s

why we called him Prongs.”

Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed

the desk drawers, and turned to look at Harry.

“Here — I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last

night,” he said, handing Harry back the Invisibility

Cloak. “And ...” He hesitated, then held out the

Marauder’s Map too. “I am no longer your teacher, so

I don’t feel guilty about giving you back this as well.

It’s no use to me, and I daresay you, Ron, and

Hermione will find uses for it.”

Harry took the map and grinned.

“You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs

would’ve wanted to lure me out of school ... you said

they’d have thought it was funny.”

“And so we would have,” said Lupin, now reaching

down to close his case. “I have no hesitation in saying

 

that James would have been highly disappointed if

his son had never found any of the secret passages

out of the castle.”

There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed

the Marauder’s Map and the Invisibility Cloak into his

pocket.

It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn’t look surprised

to see Harry there.

“Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,” he said.

“Thank you, Headmaster.”

Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty

grindylow tank.

“Well — good-bye, Harry,” he said, smiling. “It has

been a real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we’ll

meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need

to see me to the gates, I can manage. ...”

Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave

as quickly as possible.

“Good-bye, then, Remus,” said Dumbledore soberly.

Lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he

and Dumbledore could shake hands. Then, with a

final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the

office.

Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at

the floor. He heard the door close and looked up.

Dumbledore was still there.

“Why so miserable, Harry?” he said quietly. “You

should be very proud of yourself after last night.”

 

“It didn’t make any difference,” said Harry bitterly.

“Pettigrew got away.”

“Didn’t make any difference?” said Dumbledore

quietly. “It made all the difference in the world, Harry.

You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent

man from a terrible fate.”

Terrible. Something stirred in Harry’s memory.

Greater and more terrible than ever before ... Professor

Trelawney’s prediction!

“Professor Dumbledore — yesterday, when I was

having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went

very — very strange.”

“Indeed?” said Dumbledore. “Er — stranger than

usual, you mean?”

“Yes . . . her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled

and she said ... she said Voldemort’s servant was

going to set out to return to him before midnight. ...

She said the servant would help him come back to

power.” Harry stared up at Dumbledore. “And then

she sort of became normal again, and she couldn’t

remember anything she’d said. Was it — was she

making a real prediction?”

Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.

“Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been,”

he said thoughtfully. “Who’d have thought it? That

brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should

offer her a pay raise. ...”

“But — ” Harry looked at him, aghast. How could

Dumbledore take this so calmly?

 

“But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from

killing Pettigrew! That makes it my fault if Voldemort

comes back!”

“It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn’t your

experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything,

Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so

complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a

very difficult business indeed. ... Professor Trelawney,

bless her, is living proof of that. ... You did a very

noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.”

“But if he helps Voldemort back to power — !”

“Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent

Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt. ... When one

wizard saves another wizard’s life, it creates a certain

bond between them ... and I’m much mistaken if

Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry

Potter.”

“I don’t want a connection with Pettigrew!” said Harry.

“He betrayed my parents!”

“This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable,

Harry. But trust me ... the time may come when you

will be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life.”

Harry couldn’t imagine when that would be.

Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry

was thinking.

“I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and

later, Harry,” he said gently. “He would have saved

Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.”

Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn’t laugh

— he could tell Dumbledore . . .

 

“I thought it was my dad who’d conjured my

Patronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the lake

...I thought I was seeing him.”

“An easy mistake to make,” said Dumbledore softly. “I

expect you 11 tire of hearing it, but you do look

extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes ... you

have your mother’s eyes.”

Harry shook his head.

“It was stupid, thinking it was him,” he muttered. “I

mean, I knew he was dead.”

“You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You

think that we don’t recall them more clearly than ever

in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you,

Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have

need of him. How else could you produce that

particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night.”

It took a moment for Harry to realize what

Dumbledore had said.

“Last night Sirius told me all about how they became

Animagi,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “An

extraordinary achievement — not least, keeping it

quiet from me. And then I remembered the most

unusual form your Patronus took, when it charged

Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against

Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see

your father last night. ... You found him inside

yourself.”

And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his

very confused thoughts.

 

Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had

happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and

Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione,

and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term

approached, Harry heard many different theories

about what had really happened, but none of them

came close to the truth.

Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was

convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling

the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he

and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper.

Percy Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the

subject of Sirius’s escape.

“If I manage to get into the Ministry, I’ll have a lot of

proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement!”

he told the only person who would listen — his

girlfriend, Penelope.

Though the weather was perfect, though the

atmosphere was so cheerful, though he knew they

had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to

freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a

school year in worse spirits.

He certainly wasn’t the only one who was sorry to see

Professor Lupin go. The whole of Harry’s Defense

Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his

resignation.

“Wonder what they’ll give us next year?” said Seamus

Finnigan gloomily.

“Maybe a vampire,” suggested Dean Thomas

hopefully.

It wasn’t only Professor Lupin’s departure that was

weighing on Harry’s mind. He couldn’t help thinking a

 

lot about Professor Trelawney’s prediction. He kept

wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he had

sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing

that was lowering Harry’s spirits most of all was the

prospect of returning to the Dursleys. For maybe half

an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed he

would be living with Sirius from now on . . . his

parents’ best friend. ... It would have been the next

best thing to having his own father back. And while

no news of Sirius was definitely good news, because it

meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry

couldn’t help feeling miserable when he thought of

the home he might have had, and the fact that it was

now impossible.

The exam results came out on the last day of term.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione had passed every subject.

Harry was amazed that he had got through Potions.

He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might

have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose.

Snape’s behavior toward Harry over the past week

had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn’t have

thought it possible that Snape’s dislike for him could

increase, but it certainly had. A muscle twitched

unpleasantly at the corner of Snape’s thin mouth

every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly

flexing his fingers, as though itching to place them

around Harry’s throat.

Percy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and

George had scraped a handful of O.W.L.s each.

Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to their

spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had

won the House championship for the third year

running. This meant that the end of term feast took

place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that

the Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as

everybody celebrated. Even Harry managed to forget

 

about the journey back to the Dursleys the next day

as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.

As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the

next morning, Hermione gave Harry and Ron some

surprising news.

“I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just

before breakfast. I’ve decided to drop Muggle Studies.”

“But you passed your exam with three hundred and

twenty percent!” said Ron.

“I know,” sighed Hermione, “but I can’t stand another

year like this one. That Time-Turner, it was driving

me mad. I’ve handed it in. Without Muggle Studies

and Divination, I’ll be able to have a normal schedule

again.”

“I still can’t believe you didn’t tell us about it,” said

Ron grumpily. “We’re supposed to be your friends.”

“I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone,” said Hermione

severely. She looked around at Harry, who was

watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a

mountain. Two whole months before he’d see it again.

“Oh, cheer up, Harry!” said Hermione sadly.

“I’m okay,” said Harry quickly. “Just thinking about

the holidays.”

“Yeah, I’ve been thinking about them too,” said Ron.

“Harry, you’ve got to come and stay with us. I’ll fix it

up with Mum and Dad, then I’ll call you. I know how

to use a fellytone now — ”

 

“A telephone, Ron,” said Hermione. “Honestly, you

should take Muggle Studies next year. ...”

Ron ignored her.

“It’s the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How

about it, Harry? Come and stay, and we’ll go and see

it! Dad can usually get tickets from work.”

This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a

great deal.

“Yeah ... I bet the Dursleys’d be pleased to let me

come ... especially after what I did to Aunt Marge. ...”

Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron

and Hermione in several games of Exploding Snap,

and when the witch with the tea cart arrived, he

bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing

with chocolate in it.

But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that

made him truly happy turned up. ...

“Harry,” said Hermione suddenly, peering over his

shoulder. “What’s that thing outside your window?”

Harry turned to look outside. Something very small

and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the

glass. He stood up for a better look and saw that it

was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too

big for it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept

tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way and that in

the train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the

window, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt

like a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside.

The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and began

zooming around their compartment, apparently very

pleased with itself for accomplishing its task. Hedwig

 

clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval.

Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with

his great yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the

owl safely out of harm’s way.

Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him.

He ripped open the letter, and shouted, “It’s from

Sirius!”

“What?” said Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it

aloud!”

Dear Harry,

I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and

uncle. I don’t know whether they’re used to owl post

Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won’t tell you where, in

case this owl falls into the wrong hands. I have some

doubt about his reliability, but he is the best I could

find, and he did seem eager for the job.

I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but

they haven’t a hope of finding me here. I am planning

to allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon, a long way

from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle will

be lifted.

There is something I never got around to telling you

during our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the

Firebolt —

“Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I told you it

was from him!”

“Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron.

“Ouch!” The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his

hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what it

seemed to think was an affectionate way.

 

Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I

used your name but told them to take the gold from my

own Gringotts vault. Please consider it as thirteen

birthdays’ worth of presents from your godfather.

I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I

gave you that night last year when you left your

uncle’s house. I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you

before starting my journey north, but I think the sight

of me alarmed you.

I am enclosing something else for you, which I think

will make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.

If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.

I’ll write again soon.

Sirius

Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was

another piece of parchment in there. He read it

through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and

contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle of hot

butterbeer in one gulp.

I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give

him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.

“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry

happily. He looked back at Sirius’s letter.

“Hang on, there’s a P.S. ...”

I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl,

as it’s my fault he no longer has a rat.

Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting

excitedly.

 

“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at

the owl for a moment; then, to Harry’s and

Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for

Crookshanks to sniff.

“What do’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely

an owl?”

Crookshanks purred.

“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s

mine.”

Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the

way back into King’s Cross station. It was still

clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and

Hermione stepped back through the barrier of

platform nine and three-quarters. Harry spotted

Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good

distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them

suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in

greeting, his worst suspicions about them seemed

confirmed.

“I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry

as Harry bid him and Hermione good-bye, then

wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig’s

cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his

usual fashion.

“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope

Harry was still clutching in his hand. “If it’s another

form for me to sign, you’ve got another — ”

“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my

godfather.”

“Godfather?” sputtered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t

got a godfather!”

 

“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum

and dad’s best friend. He’s a convicted murderer, but

he’s broken out of wizard prison and he’s on the run.

He likes to keep in touch with me, though ... keep up

with my news ... check if I’m happy. ...”

And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle

Vernon’s face, Harry set off toward the station exit,

Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked

like a much better summer than the last.

THE RIDDLE HOUSE

The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the

Riddle House,” even though it had been many years

since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a

hill overlooking the village, some of its windows

boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading

unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor,

and easily the largest and grandest building for miles

around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict,

and unoccupied.

The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house

was “creepy.” Half a century ago, something strange

and horrible had happened there, something that the

older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss

when topics for gossip were scarce. The story had

been picked over so many times, and had been

embroidered in so many places, that nobody was

quite sure what the truth was anymore. Every version

of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty

years before, at daybreak on a fine summer’s

morning, when the Riddle House had still been well

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing

room to find all three Riddles dead.

The maid had run screaming down the hill into the

village and roused as many people as she could.

“Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice!

Still in their dinner things!”

The police were summoned, and the whole of Little

Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-

disguised excitement. Nobody wasted their breath

pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they

had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs.

Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their

grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All

the villagers cared about was the identity of their

murderer — for plainly, three apparently healthy

people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the

same night.

The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade

that night; the whole village seemed to have turned

out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for

leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived

dramatically in their midst and announced to the

suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce

had just been arrested.

“Frank!” cried several people. “Never!”

Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone

in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle

House. Frank had come back from the war with a

very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud

noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever

since.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear

more details.

“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly

listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.

“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa

once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to

mix, he didn’t.”

“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar, “he had a hard

war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to

“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked

the cook. “There’s been a spare key hanging in the

gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember!

Nobody forced the door last night! No broken

windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big

house while we was all sleeping. ...”

The villagers exchanged dark looks.

“I always thought he had a nasty look about him,

right enough,” grunted a man at the bar.

“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the

landlord.

“Told you I wouldn’t like to get on the wrong side of

Frank, didn’t I, Dot?” said an excited woman in the

corner.

“Horrible temper,” said Dot, nodding fervently. “I

remember, when he was a kid ...”

By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little

Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the

Riddles.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton,

in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was

stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was

innocent, and that the only person he had seen near

the house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been

a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.

Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and

the police were quite sure that Frank had invented

him.

Then, just when things were looking very serious for

Frank, the report on the Riddles’ bodies came back

and changed everything.

The police had never read an odder report. A team of

doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded

that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed,

shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as far as they could

tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, in a

tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all

appeared to be in perfect health — apart from the fact

that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as

though determined to find something wrong with the

bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror

upon his or her face — but as the frustrated police

said, whoever heard of three people being frightened

to death?

As there was no proof that the Riddles had been

murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go.

The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton

churchyard, and their graves remained objects of

curiosity for a while. To everyone’s surprise, and amid

a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his

cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.

“ ’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t

care what the police say,” said Dot in the Hanged

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Man. “And if he had any decency, he’d leave here,

knowing as how we knows he did it.”

But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden

for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and

then the next — for neither family stayed long.

Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new

owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place,

which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall

into disrepair.

The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these

days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they

said in the village that he kept it for “tax reasons,”

though nobody was very clear what these might be.

The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the

gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy-

seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer

than ever, but could be seen pottering around the

flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds

were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to

suppress them.

Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend

with either. Boys from the village made a habit of

throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle

House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank

worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they

broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that

old Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds

amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused

them to see him limping across the garden,

brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them.

Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him

because they, like their parents and grandparents,

thought him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one

night in August and saw something very odd up at

the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had

gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.

 

It was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining

him worse than ever in his old age. He got up and

limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of

refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in

his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he

looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights

glimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew at once

what was going on. The boys had broken into the

house again, and judging by the flickering quality of

the light, they had started a fire.

Frank had no telephone, and in any case, he had

deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had

taken him in for questioning about the Riddles’

deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back

upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was

soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing

a rusty old key from its hook by the door. He picked

up his walking stick, which was propped against the

wall, and set off into the night.

The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of

being forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank

limped around to the back of the house until he

reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took

out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the

door noiselessly.

He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had

not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although

it was very dark, he remembered where the door into

the hall was, and he groped his way toward it, his

nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any

sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He

reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to

the large mullioned windows on either side of the

front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing

the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it

muffled the sound of his feet and stick.

 

On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once

where the intruders were: At the very end of the

passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone

through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across

the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer,

grasping his walking stick firmly. Several feet from

the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the

room beyond.

The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This

surprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened

intently, for a man’s voice spoke within the room; it

sounded timid and fearful.

“There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you

are still hungry.”

“Later,” said a second voice. This too belonged to a

man — but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as

a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that

voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s

neck stand up. “Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.”

Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better

to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put

down upon some hard surface, and then the dull

scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across

the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his

back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was

wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald

patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of

sight again.

“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.

“I — I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice

nervously. “She set out to explore the house, I think.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said

the second voice. “I will need feeding in the night. The

journey has tired me greatly.”

Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer

to the door, listening very hard. There was a pause,

and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.

“My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay

here?”

“A week,” said the cold voice. “Perhaps longer. The

place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot

proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the

Quidditch World Cup is over.”

Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and

rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax,

he had heard the word “Quidditch,” which was not a

word at all.

“The — the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said

Wormtail. (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously

into his ear.) “Forgive me, but — I do not understand

— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”

“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are

pouring into the country from all over the world, and

every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on

duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity,

checking and double-checking identities. They will be

obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice

anything. So we wait.”

Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had

distinctly heard the words “Ministry of Magic,”

“wizards,” and “Muggles.” Plainly, each of these

expressions meant something secret, and Frank could

think of only two sorts of people who would speak in

 

code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold

on his walking stick once more, and listened more

closely still.

“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail

said quietly.

“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a

note of menace in the cold voice now.

A slight pause followed — and then Wormtail spoke,

the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he

was forcing himself to say this before he lost his

nerve.

“It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.”

Another pause, more protracted, and then —

“Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice

softly. “I see ...”

“My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!”

said Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. “The boy is

nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we

were to use another witch or wizard — any wizard —

the thing could be done so much more quickly! If you

allowed me to leave you for a short while — you know

that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could

be back here in as little as two days with a suitable

person — ”

“I could use another wizard,” said the cold voice

softly, “that is true. ...”

“My Lord, it makes sense,” said Wormtail, sounding

thoroughly relieved now. “Laying hands on Harry

Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a

substitute? I wonder . . . perhaps the task of nursing

me has become wearisome for you, “Wormtail? Could

this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing

more than an attempt to desert me?”

“My Lord! I — I have no wish to leave you, none at all

“Do not lie to me!” hissed the second voice. “I can

always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever

returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you

look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me. ...”

“No! My devotion to Your Lordship — ”

“Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You

would not be here if you had anywhere else to go.

How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding

every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?”

“But you seem so much stronger, My Lord — ”

“Liar,” breathed the second voice. “I am no stronger,

and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of

the little health I have regained under your clumsy

care. Silencel”

Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell

silent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear

nothing but the fire crackling. Then the second man

spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.

“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have

already explained to you, and I will use no other. I

have waited thirteen years. A few more months will

make no difference. As for the protection surrounding

the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is

needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail —

 

courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full

extent of Lord Voldemort’s wrath — ”

“My Lord, I must speak!” said Wormtail, panic in his

voice now. “All through our journey I have gone over

the plan in my head — My Lord, Bertha Jorkins’s

disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if

we proceed, if I murder — ”

“IP” whispered the second voice. “If? If you follow the

plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that

anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and

without fuss; I only wish that I could do it myself, but

in my present condition ... Come, Wormtail, one more

death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not

asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful

servant will have rejoined us — ”

“I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest

trace of sullenness in his voice.

“Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody

whose loyalty has never wavered, and you,

unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.”

“I found you,” said Wormtail, and there was definitely

a sulky edge to his voice now. “I was the one who

found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins.”

“That is true,” said the second man, sounding

amused. “A stroke of brilliance I would not have

thought possible from you, Wormtail — though, if

truth be told, you were not aware how useful she

would be when you caught her, were you?”

“I — I thought she might be useful, My Lord — ”

“Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel

amusement more pronounced than ever. “However, I

 

do not deny that her information was invaluable.

Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and

for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will

allow you to perform an essential task for me, one

that many of my followers would give their right

hands to perform. ...”

“R-really, My Lord? What — ?” Wormtail sounded

terrified again.

“Ah, Wormtail, you don’t want me to spoil the

surprise? Your part will come at the very end ... but I

promise you, you will have the honor of being just as

useful as Bertha Jorkins.”

“You ... you ...” Wormtail’s voice suddenly sounded

hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry. “You

. . . are going ... to kill me too?”

“Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily, “why

would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She

was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite

useless. In any case, awkward questions would have

been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with

the news that she had met you on her holidays.

Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well

not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside

inns. ...”

Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank

could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh

— an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.

“We could have modified her memory? But Memory

Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I

proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to

her memory not to use the information I extracted

from her, Wormtail.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware

that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery

with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a

woman. He was talking about it without any kind of

remorse — with amusement. He was dangerous — a

madman. And he was planning more murders — this

boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was — was in danger —

Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the

time to go to the police. He would creep out of the

house and head straight for the telephone box in the

village . . . but the cold voice was speaking again, and

Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot,

listening with all his might.

“One more murder . . . my faithful servant at Hogwarts

... Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is

decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet ...

I think I hear Nagini. ...”

And the second man’s voice changed. He started

making noises such as Frank had never heard before;

he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath.

Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or

seizure.

And then Frank heard movement behind him in the

dark passageway. He turned to look, and found

himself paralyzed with fright.

Something was slithering toward him along the dark

corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of

firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a

gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified,

transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a

wide, curving track through the thick dust on the

floor, coming closer and closer — What was he to do?

The only means of escape was into the room where

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where

he was the snake would surely kill him —

But before he had made his decision, the snake was

level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it

was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing

noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in

seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had

vanished through the gap.

There was sweat on Frank’s forehead now, and the

hand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the

room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and

Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible

idea. . . . This man could talk to snakes.

Frank didn’t understand what was going on. He

wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with

his hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs

didn’t seem to want to move. As he stood there

shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice

switched abruptly to English again.

“Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,” it said.

“In-indeed, My Lord?” said Wormtail.

“Indeed, yes,” said the voice. “According to Nagini,

there is an old Muggle standing right outside this

room, listening to every word we say.”

Frank didn’t have a chance to hide himself. There

were footsteps, and then the door of the room was

flung wide open.

A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed

nose, and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a

mixture of fear and alarm in his face.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your

manners?”

The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair

before the fire, but Frank couldn’t see the speaker.

The snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the

rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet

dog.

Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still

deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his

walking stick and limped over the threshold.

The fire was the only source of light in the room; it

cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank

stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it

seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank

couldn’t even see the back of his head.

“You heard everything, Muggle?” said the cold voice.

“What’s that you’re calling me?” said Frank defiantly,

for now that he was inside the room, now that the

time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver;

it had always been so in the war.

“I am calling you a Muggle,” said the voice coolly. “It

means that you are not a wizard.”

“I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank,

his voice growing steadier. “All I know is I’ve heard

enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You’ve

done murder and you’re planning more! And I’ll tell

you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration, “my

wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back — ”

“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly.

“Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort,

Muggle, for he knows ... he always knows. ...”

“Is that right?” said Frank roughly. “Lord, is it? Well, I

don’t think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn

’round and face me like a man, why don’t you?”

“But I am not a man, Muggle,” said the cold voice,

barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. “I

am much, much more than a man. However ... why

not? I will face you. ... Wormtail, come turn my chair

around.”

The servant gave a whimper.

“You heard me, Wormtail.”

Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would

rather have done anything than approach his master

and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small

man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The

snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed

slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.

And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw

what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the

floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out

a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never

heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it

raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a

rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was

dead before he hit the floor.

Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter

woke with a start.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE SCAR

Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though

he had been running. He had awoken from a vivid

dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old

scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of

lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though

someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his

skin.

He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other

reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which

were on the bedside table. He put them on and his

bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty

orange light that was filtering through the curtains

from the street lamp outside the window.

Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still

painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled

out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe,

and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A

skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright

green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more

closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging.

Harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming

about before he had awoken. It had seemed so real. ...

There had been two people he knew and one he

didn’t. ... He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to

remember. ...

The dim picture of a darkened room came to him. ...

There had been a snake on a hearth rug ... a small

man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail ... and a cold,

high voice ... the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt

as though an ice cube had slipped down into his

stomach at the very thought. ...

He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what

Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible. ...

All Harry knew was that at the moment when

Voldemort’s chair had swung around, and he, Harry,

had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of

horror, which had awoken him ... or had that been

the pain in his scar?

And who had the old man been? For there had

definitely been an old man; Harry had watched him

fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused.

Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his

bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly

lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his

cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as

fast as he tried to hold on to them. ... Voldemort and

Wormtail had been talking about someone they had

killed, though Harry could not remember the name . . .

and they had been plotting to kill someone else . . .

him).

Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes,

and stared around his bedroom as though expecting

 

to see something unusual there. As it happened,

there were an extraordinary number of unusual

things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open

at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron,

broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks.

Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that

was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which

his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor

beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been

reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures

in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange

robes were zooming in and out of sight on

broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.

Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and

watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal

by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop.

Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch — in

Harry’s opinion, the best sport in the world —

couldn’t distract him at the moment. He placed Flying

with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the

window, and drew back the curtains to survey the

street below.

Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban

street would be expected to look in the early hours of

Saturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far

as Harry could see through the darkness, there

wasn’t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.

And yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restlessly back to

the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his

scar again. It wasn’t the pain that bothered him;

Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost

all the bones from his right arm once and had them

painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been

pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long

afterward. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet

from an airborne broomstick. He was used to bizarre

 

accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you

attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry

and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.

No, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the

last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because

Voldemort had been close by. ... But Voldemort

couldn’t be here, now. ... The idea of Voldemort

lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible. ...

Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was

he half-expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the

swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as he

heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting

snore from the next room.

Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid.

There was no one in the house with him except Uncle

Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were

plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and

painless.

Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it

wasn’t as though they were ever any help to him

awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were

Harry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles who

hated and despised magic in any form, which meant

that Harry was about as welcome in their house as

dry rot. They had explained away Harry’s long

absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by

telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus’s Secure

Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew

perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry

wasn’t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but

they were still apt to blame him for anything that

went wrong about the house. Harry had never been

able to confide in them or tell them anything about

his life in the wizarding world. The very idea of going

to them when they awoke, and telling them about his

 

scar hurting him, and about his worries about

Voldemort, was laughable.

And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had

come to live with the Dursleys in the first place. If it

hadn’t been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had

the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn’t been for

Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents. ...

Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort —

the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard

who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years

— arrived at his house and killed his father and

mother. Voldemort had then turned his wand on

Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed

of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady

rise to power — and, incredibly, it had not worked.

Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had

rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with

nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead,

and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely

alive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished,

Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret

community of witches and wizards had lived for so

long had lifted, Voldemort’s followers had disbanded,

and Harry Potter had become famous.

It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover,

on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had

been even more disconcerting to find out that

everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his

name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that

heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he

went. But he was used to it now: At the end of this

summer, he would be starting his fourth year at

Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days

until he would be back at the castle again.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

But there was still a fortnight to go before he went

back to school. He looked hopelessly around his room

again, and his eye paused on the birthday cards his

two best friends had sent him at the end of July.

What would they say if Harry wrote to them and told

them about his scar hurting?

At once, Hermione Granger’s voice seemed to fill his

head, shrill and panicky.

“ Your scar hurt? Harry, that’s really serious. . . . Write

to Professor Dumbledorel And I’ll go and check

Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. ... Maybe

there’s something in there about curse scars. ...”

Yes, that would be Hermione’s advice: Go straight to

the headmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime,

consult a book. Harry stared out of the window at the

inky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a

book could help him now. As far as he knew, he was

the only living person to have survived a curse like

Voldemort’s; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he

would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical

Ailments and Afflictions. As for informing the

headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore

went during the summer holidays. He amused himself

for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long

silver beard, full-length wizard’s robes, and pointed

hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing

suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose. Wherever

Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that

Hedwig would be able to find him; Harry’s owl had

never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even

without an address. But what would he write?

Dear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but

my scar hurt this morning. Yours sincerely, Harry

Potter.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Even inside his head the words sounded stupid.

And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron

Weasley’s, reaction, and in a moment, Ron’s red hair

and long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before

Harry, wearing a bemused expression.

“ Your scar hurt? But ... but You-Knotu-Who can’t be

near you now, can he? I mean ... you’d know, wouldn’t

you? He’d be trying to do you in again, wouldn’t he? I

dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a bit

... I’ll ask Dad. ...”

Mr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked

in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the

Ministry of Magic, but he didn’t have any particular

expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry

knew. In any case, Harry didn’t like the idea of the

whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was

getting jumpy about a few moments’ pain. Mrs.

Weasley would fuss worse than Hermione, and Fred

and George, Ron’s sixteen-year-old twin brothers,

might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys

were Harry’s favorite family in the world; he was

hoping that they might invite him to stay any time

now (Ron had mentioned something about the

Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn’t want

his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his

scar.

Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What

he really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit

it to himself) was someone like — someone like a

parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask

without feeling stupid, someone who cared about

him, who had had experience with Dark Magic. ...

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

And then the solution came to him. It was so simple,

and so obvious, that he couldn’t believe it had taken

so long — Sirius.

Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room,

and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of

parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill

with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering

how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the

fact that he hadn’t thought of Sirius straight away.

But then, perhaps it wasn’t so surprising — after all,

he had only found out that Sirius was his godfather

two months ago.

There was a simple reason for Sirius’s complete

absence from Harry’s life until then — Sirius had

been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by

creatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking

fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts

when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent

— the murders for which he had been convicted had

been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort’s supporter,

whom nearly everybody now believed dead. Harry,

Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they

had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the

previous year, though only Professor Dumbledore had

believed their story.

For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was

leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had

offered him a home once his name had been cleared.

But the chance had been snatched away from him —

Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to

the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for

his life. Harry had helped him escape on the back of a

hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius

had been on the run. The home Harry might have had

if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him

all summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the

 

Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them

forever.

Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry,

even if he couldn’t be with him. It was due to Sirius

that Harry now had all his school things in his

bedroom with him. The Dursleys had never allowed

this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as

miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his

powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the

cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this.

But their attitude had changed since they had found

out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a

godfather — for Harry had conveniently forgotten to

tell them that Sirius was innocent.

Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he

had been back at Privet Drive. Both had been

delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards),

but by large, brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig

had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had

been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her

water tray before flying off again. Harry, on the other

hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm

trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever

Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were

intercepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow,

Harry found it hard to imagine dementors surviving

for long in bright sunlight; perhaps that was why

Sirius had gone south. Sirius’s letters, which were

now hidden beneath the highly useful loose

floorboard under Harry’s bed, sounded cheerful, and

in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him

if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to now, all

right. ...

Harry’s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray

light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room.

Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom

 

walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement

could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia’s

room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of

parchment and reread his finished letter.

Dear Sirius,

Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it

could hardly get through my window.

Things are the same as usual here. Dudley’s diet isn’t

going too well. My aunt found him smuggling

doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him

they ’d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing

it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation

out of the window. That’s a sort of computer thing you

can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn’t

even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind

off things.

I’m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified

you might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask

you to.

A weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar

hurt again. Last time that happened it was because

Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don’t reckon he can

be anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if

curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward?

I’ll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she’s

offhunt-\ing at the moment. Say hello to Buckbeak for

me.

Harry

Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was

no point putting in the dream; he didn’t want it to

look as though he was too worried. He folded up the

 

parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for

when Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet,

stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more.

Without glancing at his reflection, he started to get

dressed before going down to breakfast.

THE INVITATION

By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three

Dursleys were already seated around the table. None

of them looked up as he entered or sat down. Uncle

Vernon’s large red face was hidden behind the

morning’s Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a

grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her

horselike teeth.

Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow

seemed to be taking up even more space than usual.

This was saying something, as he always took up an

entire side of the square table by himself. When Aunt

Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto

Dudley’s plate with a tremulous “There you are, Diddy

darling,” Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a

most unpleasant turn since he had come home for

the summer with his end-of-year report.

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find

excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia

always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy

whose teachers didn’t understand him, while Uncle

 

Vernon maintained that “he didn’t want some swotty

little nancy boy for a son anyway.” They also skated

over the accusations of bullying in the report — “He’s

a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn’t hurt a fly!”

Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.

However, at the bottom of the report there were a few

well-chosen comments from the school nurse that not

even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain

away. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that

Dudley was big-boned, and that his poundage was

really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who

needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the

school outfitters didn’t stock knickerbockers big

enough for him anymore. The school nurse had seen

what Aunt Petunia’s eyes — so sharp when it came to

spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in

observing the comings and goings of the neighbors —

simply refused to see: that far from needing extra

nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size

and weight of a young killer whale.

So — after many tantrums, after arguments that

shook Harry’s bedroom floor, and many tears from

Aunt Petunia — the new regime had begun. The diet

sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school

nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been

emptied of all Dudley’s favorite things — fizzy drinks

and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers — and filled

instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of

things that Uncle Vernon called “rabbit food.” To

make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had

insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She

now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed

that it was a lot smaller than Dudley’s. Aunt Petunia

seemed to feel that the best way to keep up Dudley’s

morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get

more to eat than Harry.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

But Aunt Petunia didn’t know what was hidden under

the loose floorboard upstairs. She had no idea that

Harry was not following the diet at all. The moment

he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to

survive the summer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent

Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they

had risen to the occasion magnificently. Hedwig had

returned from Hermione’s house with a large box

stuffed full of sugar-free snacks. (Hermione’s parents

were dentists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had

obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock

cakes. (Harry hadn’t touched these; he had had too

much experience of Hagrid ’s cooking.) Mrs. Weasley,

however, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an

enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies. Poor

Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a full

five days to recover from the journey. And then on

Harry’s birthday (which the Dursleys had completely

ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes,

one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Sirius.

Harry still had two of them left, and so, looking

forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs,

he ate his grapefruit without complaint.

Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of

disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit

quarter.

“Is this it?” he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.

Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then

nodded pointedly at Dudley, who had already finished

his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry’s

with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.

Uncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his

large, bushy mustache, and picked up his spoon.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

The doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out

of his chair and set off down the hall. Quick as a

flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle,

Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon’s grapefruit.

Harry heard talking at the door, and someone

laughing, and Uncle Vernon answering curtly. Then

the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper

came from the hall.

Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and

looked curiously around to see where Uncle Vernon

had got to. She didn’t have to wait long to find out;

after about a minute, he was back. He looked livid.

“You,” he barked at Harry. “In the living room. Now.”

Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was

supposed to have done this time, Harry got up and

followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the

next room. Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply

behind both of them.

“So,” he said, marching over to the fireplace and

turning to face Harry as though he were about to

pronounce him under arrest. “So.”

Harry would have dearly loved to have said, “So

what?” but he didn’t feel that Uncle Vernon’s temper

should be tested this early in the morning, especially

when it was already under severe strain from lack of

food. He therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.

“This just arrived,” said Uncle Vernon. He brandished

a piece of purple writing paper at Harry. “A letter.

About you.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry’s confusion increased. Who would be writing to

Uncle Vernon about him? Who did he know who sent

letters by the postman?

Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at

the letter and began to read aloud:

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,

We have never been introduced, but I am sure you

have heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron.

As Harry might have told you, the final of the

Quidditch World Cup takes place this Monday night,

and my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get

prime tickets through his connections at the

Department of Magical Games and Sports.

I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match,

as this really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain

hasn’t hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are

extremely hard to come by. We would of course be glad

to have Harry stay for the remainder of the summer

holidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to

school.

It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as

quickly as possible in the normal way, because the

Muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and

I am not sure he even knows where it is.

Hoping to see Harry soon,

Yours sincerely,

Molly Weasley

P.S. I do hope we’ve put enough stamps on.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Uncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back

into his breast pocket, and drew out something else.

“Look at this,” he growled.

He held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley’s

letter had come, and Harry had to fight down a laugh.

Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a

square inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley

had squeezed the Dursleys’ address in minute

writing.

“She did put enough stamps on, then,” said Harry,

trying to sound as though Mrs. Weasley’s was a

mistake anyone could make. His uncle’s eyes flashed.

“The postman noticed,” he said through gritted teeth.

“Very interested to know where this letter came from,

he was. That’s why he rang the doorbell. Seemed to

think it was funny.”

Harry didn’t say anything. Other people might not

understand why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss

about too many stamps, but Harry had lived with the

Dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were

about anything even slightly out of the ordinary. Their

worst fear was that someone would find out that they

were connected (however distantly) with people like

Mrs. Weasley.

Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to

keep his expression neutral. If he didn’t do or say

anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of a

lifetime. He waited for Uncle Vernon to say

something, but he merely continued to glare. Harry

decided to break the silence.

“So — can I go then?” he asked.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

A slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon’s large purple

face. The mustache bristled. Harry thought he knew

what was going on behind the mustache: a furious

battle as two of Uncle Vernon’s most fundamental

instincts came into conflict. Allowing Harry to go

would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon

had struggled against for thirteen years. On the other

hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys’ for

the rest of the summer would get rid of him two

weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and

Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house. To

give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down

at Mrs. Weasley’s letter again.

“Who is this woman?” he said, staring at the

signature with distaste.

“You’ve seen her,” said Harry. “She’s my friend Ron’s

mother, she was meeting him off the Hog — off the

school train at the end of last term.”

He had almost said “Hogwarts Express,” and that was

a sure way to get his uncle’s temper up. Nobody ever

mentioned the name of Harry’s school aloud in the

Dursley household.

Uncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as

though trying to remember something very

unpleasant.

“Dumpy sort of woman?” he growled finally. “Load of

children with red hair?”

Harry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle

Vernon to call anyone “dumpy,” when his own son,

Dudley, had finally achieved what he’d been

threatening to do since the age of three, and become

wider than he was tall.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.

“Quidditch,” he muttered under his breath.

“Quidditch — what is this rubbish?”

Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.

“It’s a sport,” he said shortly. “Played on broom — ”

“All right, all right!” said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry

saw, with some satisfaction, that his uncle looked

vaguely panicky. Apparently his nerves couldn’t stand

the sound of the word “broomsticks” in his living

room. He took refuge in perusing the letter again.

Harry saw his lips form the words “send us your

answer ... in the normal way.” He scowled.

“What does she mean, ‘the normal way’?” he spat.

“Normal for us,” said Harry, and before his uncle

could stop him, he added, “you know, owl post. That’s

what’s normal for wizards.”

Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just

uttered a disgusting swear word. Shaking with anger,

he shot a nervous look through the window, as

though expecting to see some of the neighbors with

their ears pressed against the glass.

“How many times do I have to tell you not to mention

that unnaturalness under my roof?” he hissed, his

face now a rich plum color. “You stand there, in the

clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful

back — ”

“Only after Dudley finished with them,” said Harry

coldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so

large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

five times so as to be able to use his hands, and

which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.

“I will not be spoken to like that!” said Uncle Vernon,

trembling with rage.

But Harry wasn’t going to stand for this. Gone were

the days when he had been forced to take every single

one of the Dursleys’ stupid rules. He wasn’t following

Dudley’s diet, and he wasn’t going to let Uncle Vernon

stop him from going to the Quidditch World Cup, not

if he could help it. Harry took a deep, steadying

breath and then said, “Okay, I can’t see the World

Cup. Can I go now, then? Only I’ve got a letter to

Sirius I want to finish. You know — my godfather.”

He had done it. He had said the magic words. Now he

watched the purple recede blotchily from Uncle

Vernon’s face, making it look like badly mixed black

currant ice cream.

“You’re — you’re writing to him, are you?” said Uncle

Vernon, in a would-be calm voice — but Harry had

seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden

fear.

“Well — yeah,” said Harry, casually. “It’s been a while

since he heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn’t,

he might start thinking something’s wrong.”

He stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words.

He could almost see the cogs working under Uncle

Vernon’s thick, dark, neatly parted hair. If he tried to

stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry

was being mistreated. If he told Harry he couldn’t go

to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and

tell Sirius, who would know Harry was being

mistreated. There was only one thing for Uncle

Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion forming

 

in his uncle’s mind as though the great mustached

face were transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to

keep his own face as blank as possible. And then —

“Well, all right then. You can go to this ruddy ... this

stupid ... this World Cup thing. You write and tell

these — these Weasleys they’re to pick you up, mind.

I haven’t got time to go dropping you off all over the

country. And you can spend the rest of the summer

there. And you can tell your — your godfather ... tell

him ... tell him you’re going.”

“Okay then,” said Harry brightly.

He turned and walked toward the living room door,

fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop. He

was going ... he was going to the Weasleys’, he was

going to watch the Quidditch World Cup!

Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who

had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to

overhear Harry being told off. He looked shocked to

see the broad grin on Harry’s face.

“That was an excellent breakfast, wasn’t it?” said

Harry. “I feel really full, don’t you?”

Laughing at the astonished look on Dudley’s face,

Harry took the stairs three at a time, and hurled

himself back into his bedroom.

The first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She

was sitting in her cage, staring at Harry with her

enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the

way that meant she was annoyed about something.

Exactly what was annoying her became apparent

almost at once.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“OUCH!” said Harry as what appeared to be a small,

gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his

head. Harry massaged the spot furiously, looking up

to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small

enough to fit into the palm of his hand, whizzing

excitedly around the room like a loose firework. Harry

then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his

feet. Harry bent down, recognized Ron’s handwriting,

then tore open the envelope. Inside was a hastily

scribbled note.

Harry — DAD GOT THE TICKETS — Ireland versus

Bulgaria, Monday night. Mum’s writing to the Muggles

to ask you to stay. They might already have the letter,

I don’t know how fast Muggle post is. Thought I’d send

this with Pig anyway.

Harry stared at the word “Pig,” then looked up at the

tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the

ceiling. He had never seen anything that looked less

like a pig. Maybe he couldn’t read Ron’s writing. He

went back to the letter:

We’re coming for you whether the Muggles like it or

not, you can’t miss the World Cup, only Mum and Dad

reckon it’s better if we pretend to ask their permission

first. If they say yes, send Pig back with your answer

pronto, and we’ll come and get you at five o’clock on

Sunday. If they say no, send Pig back pronto and we’ll

come and get you at five o’clock on Sunday anyway.

Hermione’s arriving this afternoon. Percy’s started

work — the Department of International Magical

Cooperation. Don’t mention anything about Abroad

while you’re here unless you want the pants bored off

you.

See you soon —

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Ron

“Calm down!” Harry said as the small owl flew low

over his head, twittering madly with what Harry could

only assume was pride at having delivered the letter

to the right person. “Come here, I need you to take my

answer back!”

The owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig’s cage.

Hedwig looked coldly up at it, as though daring it to

try and come any closer.

Harry seized his eagle-feather quill once more,

grabbed a fresh piece of parchment, and wrote:

Ron, it’s all okay, the Muggles say I can come. See you

five o’clock tomorrow. Can’t wait.

Harry

He folded this note up very small, and with immense

difficulty, tied it to the tiny owl’s leg as it hopped on

the spot with excitement. The moment the note was

secure, the owl was off again; it zoomed out of the

window and out of sight.

Harry turned to Hedwig.

“Feeling up to a long journey?” he asked her.

Hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way.

“Can you take this to Sirius for me?” he said, picking

up his letter. “Hang on ... I just want to finish it.”

He unfolded the parchment and hastily added a

postscript.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

If you want to contact me, I’ll be at my friend Ron

Weasley’s for the rest of the summer. His dad’s got us

tickets for the Quidditch World Cup\

The letter finished, he tied it to Hedwig’s leg; she kept

unusually still, as though determined to show him

how a real post owl should behave.

“I’ll be at Ron’s when you get back, all right?” Harry

told her.

She nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft

swooshing noise, spread her enormous wings and

soared out of the open window.

Harry watched her out of sight, then crawled under

his bed, wrenched up the loose floorboard, and pulled

out a large chunk of birthday cake. He sat there on

the floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was

flooding through him. He had cake, and Dudley had

nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summer’s day,

he would be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, his scar

felt perfectly normal again, and he was going to watch

the Quidditch World Cup. It was hard, just now, to

feel worried about anything — even Lord Voldemort.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

BACK TO THE BURROW

By twelve o’clock the next day, Harry’s school trunk

was packed with his school things and all his most

prized possessions — the Invisibility Cloak he had

inherited from his father, the broomstick he had

gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he

had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year.

He had emptied his hiding place under the loose

floorboard of all food, double-checked every nook and

cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or

quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting

down the days to September the first, on which he

liked to cross off the days remaining until his return

to Hogwarts.

The atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was

extremely tense. The imminent arrival at their house

of an assortment of wizards was making the Dursleys

uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked

downright alarmed when Harry informed him that the

Weasley s would be arriving at five o’clock the very

next day.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,”

he snarled at once. “I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot

wear. They’d better have the decency to put on

normal clothes, that’s all.”

Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely

seen Mr. or Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the

Dursleys would call “normal.” Their children might

don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and

Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying

states of shabbiness. Harry wasn’t bothered about

what the neighbors would think, but he was anxious

about how rude the Dursleys might be to the

Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst

idea of wizards.

Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some

people, this might have looked like a gesture of

welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle

Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating.

Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow

diminished. This was not because the diet was at last

taking effect, but due to fright. Dudley had emerged

from his last encounter with a fully-grown wizard with

a curly pig’s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers,

and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay

for its removal at a private hospital in London. It

wasn’t altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley

kept running his hand nervously over his backside,

and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to

present the same target to the enemy.

Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn’t even

protest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery).

Aunt Petunia wasn’t eating anything at all. Her arms

were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to

be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the

furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“They’ll be driving, of course?” Uncle Vernon barked

across the table.

“Er,” said Harry.

He hadn’t thought of that. How were the Weasleys

going to pick him up? They didn’t have a car

anymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned

was currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at

Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry

of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same

today?

“I think so,” said Harry.

Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally,

Uncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr. Weasley

drove; he tended to judge other men by how big and

expensive their cars were. But Harry doubted whether

Uncle Vernon would have taken to Mr. Weasley even

if he drove a Ferrari.

Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he

couldn’t stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out

through the net curtains every few seconds, as

though there had been a warning about an escaped

rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went

back downstairs and into the living room.

Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening

cushions. Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the

paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry

was sure he was really listening with all his might for

the sound of an approaching car. Dudley was

crammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath

him, clamped firmly around his bottom. Harry

couldn’t take the tension; he left the room and went

and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement

and nerves.

But five o’clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon,

perspiring slightly in his suit, opened the front door,

peered up and down the street, then withdrew his

head quickly.

“They’re late!” he snarled at Harry.

“I know,” said Harry. “Maybe — er — the traffic’s bad,

or something.”

Ten past five ... then a quarter past five ... Harry was

starting to feel anxious himself now. At half past, he

heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia conversing in

terse mutters in the living room.

“No consideration at all.”

“We might’ve had an engagement.”

“Maybe they think theyll get invited to dinner if

they’re late.”

“Well, they most certainly won’t be,” said Uncle

Vernon, and Harry heard him stand up and start

pacing the living room. “They’ll take the boy and go,

there 11 be no hanging around. That’s if they’re coming

at all. Probably mistaken the day. I daresay their kind

don’t set much store by punctuality. Either that or

they drive some tin-pot car that’s broken d —

AAAAAAAARRRRRGH ! ”

Harry jumped up. From the other side of the living

room door came the sounds of the three Dursleys

scrambling, panic-stricken, across the room. Next

moment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking

terrified.

 

“What happened?” said Harry. “What’s the matter?”

But Dudley didn’t seem able to speak. Hands still

clamped over his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he

could into the kitchen. Harry hurried into the living

room.

Loud hangings and scrapings were coming from

behind the Dursleys’ boarded-up fireplace, which had

a fake coal fire plugged in front of it.

“What is it?” gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed

into the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the

fire. “What is it, Vernon?”

But they were left in doubt barely a second longer.

Voices could be heard from inside the blocked

fireplace.

“Ouch! Fred, no — go back, go back, there’s been

some kind of mistake — tell George not to — OUCH!

George, no, there’s no room, go back quickly and tell

Ron — ”

“Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad — maybe he’ll be able

to let us out — ”

There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards

behind the electric fire.

“Harry? Harry, can you hear us?”

The Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry

wolverines.

“What is this?” growled Uncle Vernon. “What’s going

on?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“They — they’ve tried to get here by Floo powder,”

said Harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh. “They can

travel by fire — only you’ve blocked the fireplace —

hang on — ”

He approached the fireplace and called through the

boards.

“Mr. Weasley? Can you hear me?”

The hammering stopped. Somebody inside the

chimney piece said, “Shh!”

“Mr. Weasley, it’s Harry ... the fireplace has been

blocked up. You won’t be able to get through there.”

“Damn!” said Mr. Weasley’s voice. “What on earth did

they want to block up the fireplace for?”

“They’ve got an electric fire,” Harry explained.

“Really?” said Mr. Weasley’s voice excitedly. “Eclectic,

you say? With a plug? Gracious, I must see that. ...

Let’s think ... ouch, Ron!”

Ron’s voice now joined the others’.

“What are we doing here? Has something gone

wrong?”

“Oh no, Ron,” came Fred’s voice, very sarcastically.

“No, this is exactly where we wanted to end up.”

“Yeah, we’re having the time of our lives here,” said

George, whose voice sounded muffled, as though he

was squashed against the wall.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Boys, boys ...” said Mr. Weasley vaguely. “I’m trying

to think what to do. ... Yes ... only way ... Stand back,

Harry.”

Harry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however,

moved forward.

“Wait a moment!” he bellowed at the fire. “What

exactly are you going to — ”

BANG.

The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-

up fireplace burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley,

Fred, George, and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose

chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward

over the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before

she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the

Weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including

Fred and George, who were identical to the last

freckle.

“That’s better,” panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust

from his long green robes and straightening his

glasses. “Ah — you must be Harry’s aunt and uncle!”

Tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle

Vernon, his hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon

backed away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia.

Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His best suit was

covered in white dust, which had settled in his hair

and mustache and made him look as though he had

just aged thirty years.

“Er — yes — sorry about that,” said Mr. Weasley,

lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at

the blasted fireplace. “It’s all my fault. It just didn’t

occur to me that we wouldn’t be able to get out at the

other end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo

 

Network, you see — just for an afternoon, you know,

so we could get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren’t

supposed to be connected, strictly speaking — but

I’ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel

and he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy,

though, don’t worry. I’ll light a fire to send the boys

back, and then I can repair your fireplace before I

Disapparate.”

Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn’t

understood a single word of this. They were still

gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt Petunia

staggered upright again and hid behind Uncle

Vernon.

“Hello, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley brightly. “Got your

trunk ready?”

“It’s upstairs,” said Harry, grinning back.

“Well get it,” said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he

and George left the room. They knew where Harry’s

bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the

dead of night. Harry suspected that Fred and George

were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a

lot about him from Harry.

“Well,” said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly,

while he tried to find words to break the very nasty

silence. “Very — erm — very nice place you’ve got

here.”

As the usually spotless living room was now covered

in dust and bits of brick, this remark didn’t go down

too well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon’s face

purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing

her tongue again. However, they seemed too scared to

actually say anything.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Mr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything

to do with Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go

and examine the television and the video recorder.

“They run off eckeltricity, do they?” he said

knowledgeably. “Ah yes, I can see the plugs. I collect

plugs,” he added to Uncle Vernon. “And batteries. Got

a very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I’m

mad, but there you are.”

Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad

too. He moved ever so slightly to the right, screening

Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought Mr.

Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack.

Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could

hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew

that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen.

Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley

with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal himself

behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle

Vernon’s bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt

Petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.

“Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?” said Mr.

Weasley, taking another brave stab at making

conversation.

“Yep,” said Harry, “that’s Dudley.”

He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly

looked away from each other; the temptation to burst

out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was

still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might

fall off. Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely

concerned at Dudley’s peculiar behavior. Indeed, from

the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was

quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that

Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.

“Having a good holiday, Dudley?” he said kindly.

Dudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still

harder over his massive backside.

Fred and George came back into the room carrying

Harry’s school trunk. They glanced around as they

entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into

identical evil grins.

“Ah, right,” said Mr. Weasley. “Better get cracking

then.”

He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out

his wand. Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against

the wall as one.

“Incendio\” said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the

hole in the wall behind him.

Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily

as though they had been burning for hours. Mr.

Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket,

untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and

threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green

and roared higher than ever.

“Off you go then, Fred,” said Mr. Weasley.

“Coming,” said Fred. “Oh no — hang on — ”

A bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred’s pocket and

the contents were now rolling in every direction —

big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his

pocket, then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave,

stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying

“the Burrow!” Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering

gasp. There was a whooshing sound, and Fred

vanished.

“Right then, George,” said Mr. Weasley, “you and the

trunk.”

Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the

flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold

it better. Then, with a second whoosh, George had

cried “the Burrow!” and vanished too.

“Ron, you next,” said Mr. Weasley.

“See you,” said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He

grinned broadly at Harry, then stepped into the fire,

shouted “the Burrow!” and disappeared.

Now Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.

“Well ... T>ye then,” Harry said to the Dursleys.

They didn’t say anything at all. Harry moved toward

the fire, but just as he reached the edge of the hearth,

Mr. Weasley put out a hand and held him back. He

was looking at the Dursleys in amazement.

“Harry said good-bye to you,” he said. “Didn’t you

hear him?”

“It doesn’t matter,” Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley.

“Honestly, I don’t care.”

Mr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry’s

shoulder.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You aren’t going to see your nephew till next

summer,” he said to Uncle Vernon in mild

indignation. “Surely you’re going to say good-bye?”

Uncle Vernon’s face worked furiously. The idea of

being taught consideration by a man who had just

blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be

causing him intense suffering. But Mr. Weasley’s

wand was still in his hand, and Uncle Vernon’s tiny

eyes darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully,

“Good-bye, then.”

“See you,” said Harry, putting one foot forward into

the green flames, which felt pleasantly like warm

breath. At that moment, however, a horrible gagging

sound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started

to scream.

Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer

standing behind his parents. He was kneeling beside

the coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering

on a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was

protruding from his mouth. One bewildered second

later, Harry realized that the foot-long thing was

Dudley’s tongue — and that a brightly colored toffee

wrapper lay on the floor before him.

Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside

Dudley, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and

attempted to wrench it out of his mouth;

unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse

than ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle Vernon was

bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr.

Weasley had to shout to make himself heard.

“Not to worry, I can sort him out!” he yelled,

advancing on Dudley with his wand outstretched, but

Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

herself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr.

Weasley.

“No, really!” said Mr. Weasley desperately. “It’s a

simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred —

real practical joker — but it’s only an Engorgement

Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct

it — ”

But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became

more panic-stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing

hysterically, tugging Dudley’s tongue as though

determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be

suffocating under the combined pressure of his

mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had

lost control completely, seized a china figure from on

top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr.

Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to

shatter in the blasted fireplace.

“Now really!” said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing

his wand. “I’m trying to help\”

Bellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon

snatched up another ornament.

“Harry, go! Just go!” Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand

on Uncle Vernon. “I’ll sort this out!”

Harry didn’t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon’s

second ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on

balance he thought it best to leave the situation to

Mr. Weasley. He stepped into the fire, looking over his

shoulder as he said “the Burrow!” His last fleeting

glimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting

a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon’s hand with his

wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of

Dudley, and Dudley’s tongue lolling around like a

great slimy python. But next moment Harry had

 

begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys’ living room

was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green

flames.

WEASLEYS’ WIZARD WHEEZES

Harry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to

his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until

he started to feel sick and closed his eyes. Then,

when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw

out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent

himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys’

kitchen fire.

“Did he eat it?” said Fred excitedly, holding out a

hand to pull Harry to his feet.

“Yeah,” said Harry, straightening up. “What was it?”

“Ton-Tongue Toffee,” said Fred brightly. “George and I

invented them, and we’ve been looking for someone to

test them on all summer. ...”

The tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked

around and saw that Ron and George were sitting at

the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people

Harry had never seen before, though he knew

 

immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the

two eldest Weasley brothers.

“How’re you doing, Harry?” said the nearer of the two,

grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which

Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his

fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with

dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins,

shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were

both long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured

face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he

looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and

one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.

Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry’s

hand. Bill came as something of a surprise. Harry

knew that he worked for the wizarding bank,

Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at

Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an

older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and

fond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was —

there was no other word for it — cool. He was tall,

with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He

was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang

dangling from it. Bill’s clothes would not have looked

out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry

recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of

dragon hide.

Before any of them could say anything else, there was

a faint popping noise, and Mr. Weasley appeared out

of thin air at George’s shoulder. He was looking

angrier than Harry had ever seen him.

“That wasn’t funny, Fred!” he shouted. “What on

earth did you give that Muggle boy?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I didn’t give him anything,” said Fred, with another

evil grin. “I just dropped it. ... It was his fault he went

and ate it, I never told him to.”

“You dropped it on purpose!” roared Mr. Weasley.

“You knew he’d eat it, you knew he was on a diet — ”

“How big did his tongue get?” George asked eagerly.

“It was four feet long before his parents would let me

shrink it!”

Harry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again.

“It isn’t funny\” Mr. Weasley shouted. “That sort of

behavior seriously undermines wizard-Muggle

relations! I spend half my life campaigning against the

mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons — ”

“We didn’t give it to him because he’s a Muggle!” said

Fred indignantly.

“No, we gave it to him because he’s a great bullying

git,” said George. “Isn’t he, Harry?”

“Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry earnestly.

“That’s not the point!” raged Mr. Weasley. “You wait

until I tell your mother — ”

“Tell me what?” said a voice behind them.

Mrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a

short, plump woman with a very kind face, though

her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion.

“Oh hello, Harry, dear,” she said, spotting him and

smiling. Then her eyes snapped back to her husband.

“Tell me what , Arthur?”

 

Mr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however

angry he was with Fred and George, he hadn’t really

intended to tell Mrs. Weasley what had happened.

There was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife

nervously. Then two girls appeared in the kitchen

doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One, with very bushy

brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry’s

and Ron’s friend, Hermione Granger. The other, who

was small and red-haired, was Ron’s younger sister,

Ginny. Both of them smiled at Harry, who grinned

back, which made Ginny go scarlet — she had been

very taken with Harry ever since his first visit to the

Burrow.

“Tell me what, Arthur?” Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a

dangerous sort of voice.

“It’s nothing, Molly,” mumbled Mr. Weasley, “Fred and

George just — but I’ve had words with them — ”

“What have they done this time?” said Mrs. Weasley.

“If it’s got anything to do with Weasleys’ Wizard

Wheezes — ”

“Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping,

Ron?” said Hermione from the doorway.

“He knows where he’s sleeping,” said Ron, “in my

room, he slept there last — ”

“We can all go,” said Hermione pointedly.

“Oh,” said Ron, cottoning on. “Right.”

“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.

“You stay where you are!” snarled Mrs. Weasley.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they,

Hermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway

and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through

the house to the upper stories.

“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked

as they climbed.

Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione

didn’t.

“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was

cleaning Fred and George’s room,” said Ron quietly.

“Great long price lists for stuff they’ve invented. Joke

stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads

of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they’d been

inventing all that ...”

“We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for

ages, but we never thought they were actually making

things,” said Ginny. “We thought they just liked the

noise.”

“Only, most of the stuff — well, all of it, really — was

a bit dangerous,” said Ron, “and, you know, they were

planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money,

and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren’t

allowed to make any more of it, and burned all the

order forms. ... She’s furious at them anyway. They

didn’t get as many O.W.L.s as she expected.”

O.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the

examinations Hogwarts students took at the age of

fifteen.

“And then there was this big row,” Ginny said,

“because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of

Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do

is open a joke shop.”

 

Just then a door on the second landing opened, and a

face poked out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a

very annoyed expression.

“Hi, Percy,” said Harry.

“Oh hello, Harry,” said Percy. “I was wondering who

was making all the noise. I’m trying to work in here,

you know — I’ve got a report to finish for the office —

and it’s rather difficult to concentrate when people

keep thundering up and down the stairs.”

“We’re not thundering,” said Ron irritably. “We’re

walking. Sorry if we’ve disturbed the top-secret

workings of the Ministry of Magic.”

“What are you working on?” said Harry.

“A report for the Department of International Magical

Cooperation,” said Percy smugly. “We’re trying to

standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign

imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have

been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a

year — ”

“That’ll change the world, that report will,” said Ron.

“Front page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron

leaks.”

Percy went slightly pink.

“You might sneer, Ron,” he said heatedly, “but unless

some sort of international law is imposed we might

well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-

bottomed products that seriously endanger — ”

“Yeah, yeah, all right,” said Ron, and he started off

upstairs again. Percy slammed his bedroom door

shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up

 

three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen

below echoed up to them. It sounded as though Mr.

Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the toffees.

The room at the top of the house where Ron slept

looked much as it had the last time that Harry had

come to stay: the same posters of Ron’s favorite

Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling

and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the

fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously

held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large

frog. Ron’s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but

instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered

Ron’s letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping

up and down in a small cage and twittering madly.

“Shut up, Pig,” said Ron, edging his way between two

of the four beds that had been squeezed into the

room. “Fred and George are in here with us, because

Bill and Charlie are in their room,” he told Harry.

“Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because

he’s got to work.”

“Er — why are you calling that owl Pig?” Harry asked

Ron.

“Because he’s being stupid,” said Ginny. “Its proper

name is Pigwidgeon.”

“Yeah, and that’s not a stupid name at all,” said Ron

sarcastically. “Ginny named him,” he explained to

Harry. “She reckons it’s sweet. And I tried to change

it, but it was too late, he won’t answer to anything

else. So now he’s Pig. I’ve got to keep him up here

because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me

too, come to that.”

Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting

shrilly. Harry knew Ron too well to take him

 

seriously. He had moaned continually about his old

rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when

Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten

him.

“Where’s Crookshanks?” Harry asked Hermione now.

“Out in the garden, I expect,” she said. “He likes

chasing gnomes. He’s never seen any before.”

“Percy’s enjoying work, then?” said Harry, sitting

down on one of the beds and watching the Chudley

Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the

ceiling.

“Enjoying it?” said Ron darkly. “I don’t reckon he’d

come home if Dad didn’t make him. He’s obsessed.

Just don’t get him onto the subject of his boss.

According to Mr. Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr.

Crouch . . . Mr. Crouch is of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch

was telling me ... They 11 be announcing their

engagement any day now.”

“Have you had a good summer, Harry?” said

Hermione. “Did you get our food parcels and

everything?”

“Yeah, thanks a lot,” said Harry. “They saved my life,

those cakes.”

“And have you heard from — ?” Ron began, but at a

look from Hermione he fell silent. Harry knew Ron

had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and

Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping

Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they

were almost as concerned about Harry’s godfather as

he was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny

was a bad idea. Nobody but themselves and Professor

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or

believed in his innocence.

“I think they’ve stopped arguing,” said Hermione, to

cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was

looking curiously from Ron to Harry. “Shall we go

down and help your mum with dinner?”

“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. The four of them left Ron’s

room and went back downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley

alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad-tempered.

“We’re eating out in the garden,” she said when they

came in. “There’s just not room for eleven people in

here. Could you take the plates outside, girls? Bill

and Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and

forks, please, you two,” she said to Ron and Harry,

pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she

had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which

shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off

the walls and ceiling.

“Oh for heaven’s sake,” she snapped, now directing

her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the

sideboard and started skating across the floor,

scooping up the potatoes. “Those two!” she burst out

savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a

cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and

George. “I don’t know what’s going to happen to them,

I really don’t. No ambition, unless you count making

as much trouble as they possibly can. ...”

Mrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down

on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand

around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the

wand tip as she stirred.

“It’s not as though they haven’t got brains,” she

continued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the

 

stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand,

“but they’re wasting them, and unless they pull

themselves together soon, they’ll be in real trouble.

I’ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than

the rest put together. If they carry on the way they’re

going, they’ll end up in front of the Improper Use of

Magic Office.”

Mrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer,

which shot open. Harry and Ron both jumped out of

the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across

the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which

had just been tipped back into the sink by the

dustpan.

“I don’t know where we went wrong with them,” said

Mrs. Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to

pull out still more saucepans. “It’s been the same for

years, one thing after another, and they won’t listen

to — OH NOT AGAIN.”

She had picked up her wand from the table, and it

had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant

rubber mouse.

“One of their fake wands again!” she shouted. “How

many times have I told them not to leave them lying

around?”

She grabbed her real wand and turned around to find

that the sauce on the stove was smoking.

“C’mon,” Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a

handful of cutlery from the open drawer, “let’s go and

help Bill and Charlie.”

They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door

into the yard.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

They had only gone a few paces when Hermione’s

bandy-legged ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting

out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the

air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs.

Harry recognized it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten

inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it

sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one

of the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the

door. Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as

Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to

reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was

coming from the other side of the house. The source

of the commotion was revealed as they entered the

garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their

wands out, and were making two battered old tables

fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other,

each attempting to knock the other’s out of the air.

Fred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing,

and Hermione was hovering near the hedge,

apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.

Bill’s table caught Charlie’s with a huge bang and

knocked one of its legs off. There was a clatter from

overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy’s head

poking out of a window on the second floor.

“Will you keep it down?!” he bellowed.

“Sorry, Perce,” said Bill, grinning. “How’re the

cauldron bottoms coming on?”

“Very badly,” said Percy peevishly, and he slammed

the window shut. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed

the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then,

with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg

and conjured tablecloths from nowhere.

By seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under

dishes and dishes of Mrs. Weasley’s excellent cooking,

 

and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were

settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-

blue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals

of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was

paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than

talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie,

boiled potatoes, and salad.

At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father

all about his report on cauldron bottoms.

“I’ve told Mr. Crouch that I’ll have it ready by

Tuesday,” Percy was saying pompously. “That’s a bit

sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of

things. I think he’ll be grateful I’ve done it in good

time, I mean, it’s extremely busy in our department

just now, what with all the arrangements for the

World Cup. We’re just not getting the support we

need from the Department of Magical Games and

Sports. Ludo Bagman — ”

“I like Ludo,” said Mr. Weasley mildly. “He was the

one who got us such good tickets for the Cup. I did

him a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into a spot

of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I

smoothed the whole thing over.”

“Oh Bagman’s likable enough, of course,” said Percy

dismissively, “but how he ever got to be Head of

Department ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch! I

can’t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our

department and not trying to find out what’s

happened to them. You realize Bertha Jorkins has

been missing for over a month now? Went on holiday

to Albania and never came back?”

“Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,” said Mr.

Weasley, frowning. “He says Bertha’s gotten lost

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

plenty of times before now — though I must say, if it

was someone in my department, I’d be worried. ...”

“Oh Bertha’s hopeless, all right,” said Percy. “I hear

she’s been shunted from department to department

for years, much more trouble than she’s worth ... but

all the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find her.

Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest, she

worked in our department at one time, you know, and

I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but

Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably

misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of

Albania. However” — Percy heaved an impressive sigh

and took a deep swig of elderflower wine — “we’ve got

quite enough on our plates at the Department of

International Magical Cooperation without trying to

find members of other departments too. As you know,

we’ve got another big event to organize right after the

World Cup.”

Percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down

toward the end of the table where Harry, Ron, and

Hermione were sitting. “ You know the one I’m talking

about, Father.” He raised his voice slightly. “The top-

secret one.”

Ron rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and

Hermione, “He’s been trying to get us to ask what that

event is ever since he started work. Probably an

exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.”

In the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing

with Bill about his earring, which seemed to be a

recent acquisition.

“... with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what

do they say at the bank?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress

as long as I bring home plenty of treasure,” said Bill

patiently.

“And your hair’s getting silly, dear,” said Mrs.

Weasley, fingering her wand lovingly. “I wish you’d let

me give it a trim. ...”

“I like it,” said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill.

“You’re so old-fashioned, Mum. Anyway, it’s nowhere

near as long as Professor Dumbledore’s. ...”

Next to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were

all talking spiritedly about the World Cup.

“It’s got to be Ireland,” said Charlie thickly, through a

mouthful of potato. “They flattened Peru in the

semifinals.”

“Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,” said Fred.

“Krum’s one decent player, Ireland has got seven,”

said Charlie shortly. “I wish England had got through.

That was embarrassing, that was.”

“What happened?” said Harry eagerly, regretting more

than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when

he was stuck on Privet Drive.

“Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and

ninety to ten,” said Charlie gloomily. “Shocking

performance. And Wales lost to Uganda, and Scotland

was slaughtered by Luxembourg.”

Harry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch

team ever since his first year at Hogwarts and owned

one of the best racing brooms in the world, a Firebolt.

Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

else in the magical world, and he played in the

position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.

Mr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the

darkening garden before they had their homemade

strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had

finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and

the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass

and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed

and at peace with the world as he watched several

gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing

madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.

Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the

rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said

very quietly to Harry, “So — have you heard from

Sirius lately?”

Hermione looked around, listening closely.

“Yeah,” said Harry softly, “twice. He sounds okay. I

wrote to him yesterday. He might write back while I’m

here.”

He suddenly remembered the reason he had written

to Sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling

Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and

about the dream that had awoken him . . . but he

really didn’t want to worry them just now, not when

he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.

“Look at the time,” Mrs. Weasley said suddenly,

checking her wristwatch. “You really should be in

bed, the whole lot of you — you’ll be up at the crack

of dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your

school list out, I’ll get your things for you tomorrow in

Diagon Alley. I’m getting everyone else’s. There might

not be time after the World Cup, the match went on

for five days last time.”

 

“Wow — hope it does this time!” said Harry

enthusiastically.

“Well, I certainly don’t,” said Percy sanctimoniously. “I

shudder to think what the state of my in-tray would

be if I was away from work for five days.”

“Yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again,

eh, Perce?” said Fred.

“That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!” said

Percy, going very red in the face. “It was nothing

personall”

“It was,” Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from

the table. “We sent it.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE PORTKEY

Harry felt as though he had barely lain down to sleep

in Ron’s room when he was being shaken awake by

Mrs. Weasley.

“Time to go, Harry, dear,” she whispered, moving

away to wake Ron.

Harry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and

sat up. It was still dark outside. Ron muttered

indistinctly as his mother roused him. At the foot of

Harry’s mattress he saw two large, disheveled shapes

emerging from tangles of blankets.

“ ’S’ time already?” said Fred groggily.

They dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then,

yawning and stretching, the four of them headed

downstairs into the kitchen.

Mrs. Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot

on the stove, while Mr. Weasley was sitting at the

table, checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets. He

 

looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so

that they could see his clothes more clearly. He was

wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a

very old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held

up with a thick leather belt.

“What d’you think?” he asked anxiously. “We’re

supposed to go incognito — do I look like a Muggle,

Harry?”

“Yeah,” said Harry, smiling, “very good.”

“Where ’re Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?” said

George, failing to stifle a huge yawn.

“Well, they’re Apparating, aren’t they?” said Mrs.

Weasley, heaving the large pot over to the table and

starting to ladle porridge into bowls. “So they can

have a bit of a lie-in.”

Harry knew that Apparating meant disappearing from

one place and reappearing almost instantly in

another, but had never known any Hogwarts student

to do it, and understood that it was very difficult.

“So they’re still in bed?” said Fred grumpily, pulling

his bowl of porridge toward him. “Why can’t we

Apparate too?”

“Because you’re not of age and you haven’t passed

your test,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “And where have

those girls got to?”

She bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her

climbing the stairs.

“You have to pass a test to Apparate?” Harry asked.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Oh yes,” said Mr. Weasley, tucking the tickets safely

into the back pocket of his jeans. “The Department of

Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people

the other day for Apparating without a license. It’s not

easy, Apparition, and when it’s not done properly it

can lead to nasty complications. This pair I’m talking

about went and splinched themselves.”

Everyone around the table except Harry winced.

“Er — splinched?” said Harry.

“They left half of themselves behind,” said Mr.

Weasley, now spooning large amounts of treacle onto

his porridge. “So, of course, they were stuck. Couldn’t

move either way. Had to wait for the Accidental Magic

Reversal Squad to sort them out. Meant a fair old bit

of paperwork, I can tell you, what with the Muggles

who spotted the body parts they’d left behind. ...”

Harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an

eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of Privet

Drive.

“Were they okay?” he asked, startled.

“Oh yes,” said Mr. Weasley matter-of-factly. “But they

got a heavy fine, and I don’t think they’ll be trying it

again in a hurry. You don’t mess around with

Apparition. There are plenty of adult wizards who

don’t bother with it. Prefer brooms — slower, but

safer.”

“But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?”

“Charlie had to take the test twice,” said Fred,

grinning. “He failed the first time, Apparated five

miles south of where he meant to, right on top of

some poor old dear doing her shopping, remember?”

 

“Yes, well, he passed the second time,” said Mrs.

Weasley, marching back into the kitchen amid hearty

sniggers.

“Percy only passed two weeks ago,” said George. “He’s

been Apparating downstairs every morning since, just

to prove he can.”

There were footsteps down the passageway and

Hermione and Ginny came into the kitchen, both

looking pale and drowsy.

“Why do we have to be up so early?” Ginny said,

rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table.

“We’ve got a bit of a walk,” said Mr. Weasley.

“Walk?” said Harry. “What, are we walking to the

World Cup?”

“No, no, that’s miles away,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling.

“We only need to walk a short way. It’s just that it’s

very difficult for a large number of wizards to

congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We

have to be very careful about how we travel at the

best of times, and on a huge occasion like the

Quidditch World Cup — ”

“George!” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, and they all

jumped.

“What?” said George, in an innocent tone that

deceived nobody.

“What is that in your pocket?”

“Nothing!”

“Don’t you lie to me!”

 

Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at George’s pocket

and said, “Acciol”

Several small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of

George’s pocket; he made a grab for them but missed,

and they sped right into Mrs. Weasley ’s outstretched

hand.

“We told you to destroy them!” said Mrs. Weasley

furiously, holding up what were unmistakably more

Ton-Tongue Toffees. “We told you to get rid of the lot!

Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!”

It was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently

been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the

house as possible, and it was only by using her

Summoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed to

find them all.

“Acciol Acciol Acciol” she shouted, and toffees zoomed

from all sorts of unlikely places, including the lining

of George’s jacket and the turn-ups of Fred’s jeans.

“We spent six months developing those!” Fred

shouted at his mother as she threw the toffees away.

“Oh a fine way to spend six months!” she shrieked.

“No wonder you didn’t get more O.W.L.s!”

All in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as

they took their departure. Mrs. Weasley was still

glowering as she kissed Mr. Weasley on the cheek,

though not nearly as much as the twins, who had

each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and

walked out without a word to her.

“Well, have a lovely time,” said Mrs. Weasley, “and

behave yourselves,” she called after the twins’

retreating backs, but they did not look back or

 

answer. “I’ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along

around midday,” Mrs. Weasley said to Mr. Weasley, as

he, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny set off across

the dark yard after Fred and George.

It was chilly and the moon was still out. Only a dull,

greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed

that daybreak was drawing closer. Harry, having been

thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward

the Quidditch World Cup, sped up to walk with Mr.

Weasley.

“So how does everyone get there without all the

Muggles noticing?” he asked.

“It’s been a massive organizational problem,” sighed

Mr. Weasley. “The trouble is, about a hundred

thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of

course, we just haven’t got a magical site big enough

to accommodate them all. There are places Muggles

can’t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred

thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine

and three-quarters. So we had to find a nice deserted

moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as

possible. The whole Ministry’s been working on it for

months. First, of course, we have to stagger the

arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive

two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle

transport, but we can’t have too many clogging up

their buses and trains — remember, wizards are

coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of

course, but we have to set up safe points for them to

appear, well away from Muggles. I believe there’s a

handy wood they’re using as the Apparition point. For

those who don’t want to Apparate, or can’t, we use

Portkeys. They’re objects that are used to transport

wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged

time. You can do large groups at a time if you need to.

There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at

 

strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one

to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that’s

where we’re headed.”

Mr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large

black mass rose beyond the village of Ottery St.

Catchpole.

“What sort of objects are Portkeys?” said Harry

curiously.

“Well, they can be anything,” said Mr. Weasley.

“Unobtrusive things, obviously, so Muggles don’t go

picking them up and playing with them . . . stuff they’ll

just think is litter. ...”

They trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the

village, the silence broken only by their footsteps. The

sky lightened very slowly as they made their way

through the village, its inky blackness diluting to

deepest blue. Harry’s hands and feet were freezing.

Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch.

They didn’t have breath to spare for talking as they

began to climb Stoatshead Hill, stumbling

occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick

black tuffets of grass. Each breath Harry took was

sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize

up when, at last, his feet found level ground.

“Whew,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking off his glasses

and wiping them on his sweater. “Well, we’ve made

good time — we’ve got ten minutes. ...”

Hermione came over the crest of the hill last,

clutching a stitch in her side.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Now we just need the Portkey,” said Mr. Weasley,

replacing his glasses and squinting around at the

ground. “It won’t be big. ... Come on ...”

They spread out, searching. They had only been at it

for a couple of minutes, however, when a shout rent

the still air.

“Over here, Arthur! Over here, son, we’ve got it!”

Two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry

sky on the other side of the hilltop.

“Amos!” said Mr. Weasley, smiling as he strode over to

the man who had shouted. The rest of them followed.

Mr. Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy-faced

wizard with a scrubby brown beard, who was holding

a moldy-looking old boot in his other hand.

“This is Amos Diggory, everyone,” said Mr. Weasley.

“He works for the Department for the Regulation and

Control of Magical Creatures. And I think you know

his son, Cedric?”

Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of

around seventeen. He was Captain and Seeker of the

Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.

“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all.

Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who

merely nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric

for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first

Quidditch match of the previous year.

“Long walk, Arthur?” Cedric’s father asked.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley. “We live just on the

other side of the village there. You?”

“Had to get up at two, didn’t we, Ced? I tell you, I’ll be

glad when he’s got his Apparition test. Still ... not

complaining ... Quidditch World Cup, wouldn’t miss it

for a sackful of Galleons — and the tickets cost about

that. Mind you, looks like I got off easy. ...” Amos

Diggory peered good-naturedly around at the three

Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny. “All these

yours, Arthur?”

“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley,

pointing out his children. “This is Hermione, friend of

Ron’s — and Harry, another friend — ”

“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes

widening. “Harry? Harry Potter?”

“Er — yeah,” said Harry.

Harry was used to people looking curiously at him

when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved

at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it

always made him feel uncomfortable.

“Ced’s talked about you, of course,” said Amos

Diggory. “Told us all about playing against you last

year. ... I said to him, I said — Ced, that’ll be

something to tell your grandchildren, that will. ... You

beat Harry Potterl”

Harry couldn’t think of any reply to this, so he

remained silent. Fred and George were both scowling

again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.

“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered. “I told

you ... it was an accident. ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos

genially, slapping his son on his back. “Always

modest, our Ced, always the gentleman ... but the

best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same,

wouldn’t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays

on, you don’t need to be a genius to tell which one’s

the better flier!”

“Must be nearly time,” said Mr. Weasley quickly,

pulling out his watch again. “Do you know whether

we’re waiting for any more, Amos?”

“No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already

and the Fawcetts couldn’t get tickets,” said Mr.

Diggory. “There aren’t any more of us in this area, are

there?”

“Not that I know of,” said Mr. Weasley. “Yes, it’s a

minute off. ... We’d better get ready. ...”

He looked around at Harry and Hermione.

“You just need to touch the Portkey, that’s all, a

finger will do — ”

With difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the

nine of them crowded around the old boot held out by

Amos Diggory.

They all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze

swept over the hilltop. Nobody spoke. It suddenly

occurred to Harry how odd this would look if a

Muggle were to walk up here now ... nine people, two

of them grown men, clutching this manky old boot in

the semidarkness, waiting. ...

“Three ...” muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his

watch, “two ... one ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

It happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook

just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked

irresistibly forward. His feet left the ground; he could

feel Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their

shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding

forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his

forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was

pulling him magnetically onward and then —

His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into

him and he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near

his head with a heavy thud.

Harry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and

Cedric were still standing, though looking very

windswept; everybody else was on the ground.

“Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,” said a voice.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

BAGMAN AND CROUCH

Harry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his

feet. They had arrived on what appeared to be a

deserted stretch of misty moor. In front of them was a

pair of tired and grumpy-looking wizards, one of

whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a

thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed

as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the

watch wore a tweed suit with thigh-length galoshes;

his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.

“Morning, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, picking up the

boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it

into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry

could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can,

and a punctured football.

“Hello there, Arthur,” said Basil wearily. “Not on duty,

eh? It’s all right for some. ... We’ve been here all

night. ... You’d better get out of the way, we’ve got a

big party coming in from the Black Forest at five-

fifteen. Hang on, I’ll find your campsite. ... Weasley ...

Weasley ...” He consulted his parchment list. “About a

 

quarter of a mile’s walk over there, first field you

come to. Site manager’s called Mr. Roberts. Diggory ...

second field ... ask for Mr. Payne.”

“Thanks, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, and he beckoned

everyone to follow him.

They set off across the deserted moor, unable to make

out much through the mist. After about twenty

minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam

into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the

ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents,

rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a

dark wood on the horizon. They said good-bye to the

Diggorys and approached the cottage door.

A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at

the tents. Harry knew at a glance that this was the

only real Muggle for several acres. When he heard

their footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.

“Morning!” said Mr. Weasley brightly.

“Morning,” said the Muggle.

“Would you be Mr. Roberts?”

“Aye, I would,” said Mr. Roberts. “And who’re you?”

“Weasley — two tents, booked a couple of days ago?”

“Aye,” said Mr. Roberts, consulting a list tacked to the

door. “You’ve got a space up by the wood there. Just

the one night?”

“That’s it,” said Mr. Weasley.

“You’ll be paying now, then?” said Mr. Roberts.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Ah — right — certainly — ” said Mr. Weasley. He

retreated a short distance from the cottage and

beckoned Harry toward him. “Help me, Harry,” he

muttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money from his

pocket and starting to peel the notes apart. “This

one’s a — a — a ten? Ah yes, I see the little number

on it now. ... So this is a five?”

“A twenty,” Harry corrected him in an undertone,

uncomfortably aware of Mr. Roberts trying to catch

every word.

“Ah yes, so it is. ... I don’t know, these little bits of

paper ...”

“You foreign?” said Mr. Roberts as Mr. Weasley

returned with the correct notes.

“Foreign?” repeated Mr. Weasley, puzzled.

“You’re not the first one who’s had trouble with

money,” said Mr. Roberts, scrutinizing Mr. Weasley

closely. “I had two try and pay me with great gold

coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago.”

“Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley nervously.

Mr. Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some

change.

“Never been this crowded,” he said suddenly, looking

out over the misty field again. “Hundreds of pre-

bookings. People usually just turn up. ...”

“Is that right?” said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out

for his change, but Mr. Roberts didn’t give it to him.

“Aye,” he said thoughtfully. “People from all over.

Loads of foreigners. And not just foreigners. Weirdos,

 

you know? There’s a bloke walking ’round in a kilt

and a poncho.”

“Shouldn’t he?” said Mr. Weasley anxiously.

“It’s like some sort of ... I dunno ... like some sort of

rally,” said Mr. Roberts. “They all seem to know each

other. Like a big party.”

At that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out

of thin air next to Mr. Roberts’s front door.

“Obliviate\” he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr.

Roberts.

Instantly, Mr. Roberts’s eyes slid out of focus, his

brows unknitted, and a look of dreamy unconcern fell

over his face. Harry recognized the symptoms of one

who had just had his memory modified.

“A map of the campsite for you,” Mr. Roberts said

placidly to Mr. Weasley. “And your change.”

“Thanks very much,” said Mr. Weasley.

The wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward

the gate to the campsite. He looked exhausted: His

chin was blue with stubble and there were deep

purple shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot

of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr. Weasley, “Been

having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory

Charm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo

Bagman’s not helping. Trotting around talking about

Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a

worry about anti-Muggle security. Blimey, I’ll be glad

when this is over. See you later, Arthur.”

He Disapparated.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games

and Sports,” said Ginny, looking surprised. “He

should know better than to talk about Bludgers near

Muggles, shouldn’t he?”

“He should,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading

them through the gates into the campsite, “but Ludo’s

always been a bit ... well ... lax about security. You

couldn’t wish for a more enthusiastic head of the

sports department though. He played Quidditch for

England himself, you know. And he was the best

Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had.”

They trudged up the misty field between long rows of

tents. Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had

clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible,

but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls,

or weather vanes. However, here and there was a tent

so obviously magical that Harry could hardly be

surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious.

Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection

of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several

live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little farther

on they passed a tent that had three floors and

several turrets; and a short way beyond that was a

tent that had a front garden attached, complete with

birdbath, sundial, and fountain.

“Always the same,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling. “We

can’t resist showing off when we get together. Ah,

here we are, look, this is us.”

They had reached the very edge of the wood at the top

of the field, and here was an empty space, with a

small sign hammered into the ground that read

WEEZLY.

“Couldn’t have a better spot!” said Mr. Weasley

happily. “The field is just on the other side of the

 

wood there, we’re as close as we could be.” He hoisted

his backpack from his shoulders. “Right,” he said

excitedly, “no magic allowed, strictly speaking, not

when we’re out in these numbers on Muggle land.

We’ll be putting these tents up by hand! Shouldn’t be

too difficult. ... Muggles do it all the time. ... Here,

Harry, where do you reckon we should start?”

Harry had never been camping in his life; the

Dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday,

preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old

neighbor. However, he and Hermione worked out

where most of the poles and pegs should go, and

though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a

help, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it

came to using the mallet, they finally managed to

erect a pair of shabby two-man tents.

All of them stood back to admire their handiwork.

Nobody looking at these tents would guess they

belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble

was that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they

would be a party of ten. Hermione seemed to have

spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical

look as Mr. Weasley dropped to his hands and knees

and entered the first tent.

“Well be a bit cramped,” he called, “but I think we’ll

all squeeze in. Come and have a look.”

Harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt

his jaw drop. He had walked into what looked like an

old-fashioned, three-room flat, complete with

bathroom and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was

furnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs.

Figg’s house: There were crocheted covers on the

mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Well, it’s not for long,” said Mr. Weasley, mopping his

bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the

four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom. “I

borrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn’t

camp much anymore, poor fellow, he’s got lumbago.”

He picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it.

“Well need water. ...”

“There’s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave

us,” said Ron, who had followed Harry inside the tent

and seemed completely unimpressed by its

extraordinary inner proportions. “It’s on the other

side of the field.”

“Well, why don’t you, Harry, and Hermione go and get

us some water then” — Mr. Weasley handed over the

kettle and a couple of saucepans — “and the rest of

us will get some wood for a fire?”

“But we’ve got an oven,” said Ron. “Why can’t we just

“Ron, anti-Muggle security!” said Mr. Weasley, his

face shining with anticipation. “When real Muggles

camp, they cook on fires outdoors. I’ve seen them at

it!

After a quick tour of the girls’ tent, which was slightly

smaller than the boys’, though without the smell of

cats, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off across the

campsite with the kettle and saucepans.

Now, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting,

they could see the city of tents that stretched in every

direction. They made their way slowly through the

rows, staring eagerly around. It was only just

dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

there must be in the world; he had never really

thought much about those in other countries.

Their fellow campers were starting to wake up. First

to stir were the families with small children; Harry

had never seen witches and wizards this young

before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched

outside a large pyramid-shaped tent, holding a wand

and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was

swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew

level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the

tent.

“ How ma.ny times, Kevin? You don’t — touch —

Daddy’s — wand — yecchh!”

She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her

scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling

with the little boy’s yells — “You bust slug! You bust

slug!”

A short way farther on, they saw two little witches,

barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy

broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls’

toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had

already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron,

and Hermione he muttered distractedly, “In broad

daylight! Parents having a lie-in, I suppose — ”

Here and there adult wizards and witches were

emerging from their tents and starting to cook

breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them,

conjured fires with their wands; others were striking

matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though

sure this couldn’t work. Three African wizards sat in

serious conversation, all of them wearing long white

robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a

bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged

American witches sat gossiping happily beneath a

 

spangled banner stretched between their tents that

read: THE SALEM WITCHES’ INSTITUTE. Harry

caught snatches of conversation in strange languages

from the inside of tents they passed, and though he

couldn’t understand a word, the tone of every single

voice was excited.

“Er — is it my eyes, or has everything gone green?”

said Ron.

It wasn’t just Ron’s eyes. They had walked into a

patch of tents that were all covered with a thick

growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though

small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the

earth. Grinning faces could be seen under those that

had their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they

heard their names.

“Harry! Ron! Hermione!”

It was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth

year. He was sitting in front of his own shamrock-

covered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who had to

be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas,

also of Gryffindor.

“Like the decorations?” said Seamus, grinning. “The

Ministry’s not too happy.”

“Ah, why shouldn’t we show our colors?” said Mrs.

Finnigan. “You should see what the Bulgarians have

got dangling all over their tents. You’ll be supporting

Ireland, of course?” she added, eyeing Harry, Ron,

and Hermione beadily. When they had assured her

that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off

again, though, as Ron said, “Like we’d say anything

else surrounded by that lot.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all

over their tents?” said Hermione.

“Let’s go and have a look,” said Harry, pointing to a

large patch of tents upheld, where the Bulgarian flag

— white, green, and red — was fluttering in the

breeze.

The tents here had not been bedecked with plant life,

but each and every one of them had the same poster

attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy

black eyebrows. The picture was, of course, moving,

but all it did was blink and scowl.

“Krum,” said Ron quietly.

“What?” said Hermione.

“Krum!” said Ron. “Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian

Seeker!”

“He looks really grumpy,” said Hermione, looking

around at the many Krums blinking and scowling at

them.

“ ‘Really grumpy’?” Ron raised his eyes to the

heavens. “Who cares what he looks like? He’s

unbelievable. He’s really young too. Only just eighteen

or something. He’s a genius, you wait until tonight,

you’ll see.”

There was already a small queue for the tap in the

corner of the field. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined

it, right behind a pair of men who were having a

heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard

who was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other

was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a

pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with

exasperation.

 

“Just put them on, Archie, there’s a good chap. You

can’t walk around like that, the Muggle at the gate’s

already getting suspicious — ”

“I bought this in a Muggle shop,” said the old wizard

stubbornly. “Muggles wear them.”

“Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they

wear these,” said the Ministry wizard, and he

brandished the pinstriped trousers.

“I’m not putting them on,” said old Archie in

indignation. “I like a healthy breeze ’round my

privates, thanks.”

Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the

giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the

queue and only returned when Archie had collected

his water and moved away.

Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of

the water, they made their way back through the

campsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar

faces: other Hogwarts students with their families.

Oliver Wood, the old captain of Harry’s House

Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged

Harry over to his parents’ tent to introduce him, and

told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the

Puddlemere United reserve team. Next they were

hailed by Ernie Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year,

and a little farther on they saw Cho Chang, a very

pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team.

She waved and smiled at Harry, who slopped quite a

lot of water down his front as he waved back. More to

stop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry

hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers

whom he had never seen before.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Who d’you reckon they are?” he said. “They don’t go

to Hogwarts, do they?”

“ ’Spect they go to some foreign school,” said Ron. “I

know there are others. Never met anyone who went to

one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil

. . . this was years and years ago . . . and he wanted to

go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn’t

afford it. His penfriend got all offended when he said

he wasn’t going and sent him a cursed hat. It made

his ears shrivel up.”

Harry laughed but didn’t voice the amazement he felt

at hearing about other wizarding schools. He

supposed, now that he saw representatives of so

many nationalities in the campsite, that he had been

stupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn’t be the

only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly

unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had

run across the news about other wizarding schools in

some book or other.

“You’ve been ages,” said George when they finally got

back to the Weasleys’ tents.

“Met a few people,” said Ron, setting the water down.

“You not got that fire started yet?”

“Dad’s having fun with the matches,” said Fred.

Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting

the fire, but it wasn’t for lack of trying. Splintered

matches littered the ground around him, but he

looked as though he was having the time of his life.

“Oops!” he said as he managed to light a match and

promptly dropped it in surprise.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Come here, Mr. Weasley,” said Hermione kindly,

taking the box from him, and showing him how to do

it properly.

At last they got the fire lit, though it was at least

another hour before it was hot enough to cook

anything. There was plenty to watch while they

waited, however. Their tent seemed to be pitched right

alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field, and

Ministry members kept hurrying up and down it,

greeting Mr. Weasley cordially as they passed. Mr.

Weasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for

Harry’s and Hermione’s benefit; his own children

knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly

interested.

“That was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin

Liaison Office. ... Here comes Gilbert Wimple; he’s

with the Committee on Experimental Charms; he’s

had those horns for awhile now. ... Hello, Arnie ...

Arnold Peasegood, he’s an Obliviator — member of the

Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, you know. ... and

that’s Bode and Croaker ... they’re Unspeakables. ...”

“They’re what?”

“From the Department of Mysteries, top secret, no

idea what they get up to. ...”

At last, the fire was ready, and they had just started

cooking eggs and sausages when Bill, Charlie, and

Percy came strolling out of the woods toward them.

“Just Apparated, Dad,” said Percy loudly. “Ah,

excellent, lunch!”

They were halfway through their plates of eggs and

sausages when Mr. Weasley jumped to his feet,

waving and grinning at a man who was striding

 

toward them. “Aha!” he said. “The man of the

moment! Ludo!”

Ludo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person

Harry had seen so far, even including old Archie in

his flowered nightdress. He was wearing long

Quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright

yellow and black. An enormous picture of a wasp was

splashed across his chest. He had the look of a

powerfully built man gone slightly to seed; the robes

were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely

had not had in the days when he had played

Quidditch for England. His nose was squashed

(probably broken by a stray Bludger, Harry thought),

but his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy

complexion made him look like a very overgrown

schoolboy.

“Ahoy there!” Bagman called happily. He was walking

as though he had springs attached to the balls of his

feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement.

“Arthur, old man,” he puffed as he reached the

campfire, “what a day, eh? What a day! Could we

have asked for more perfect weather? A cloudless

night coming . . . and hardly a hiccough in the

arrangements. ... Not much for me to do!”

Behind him, a group of haggard-looking Ministry

wizards rushed past, pointing at the distant evidence

of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet

sparks twenty feet into the air.

Percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched.

Apparently his disapproval of the way Ludo Bagman

ran his department did not prevent him from wanting

to make a good impression.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Ah — yes,” said Mr. Weasley, grinning, “this is my

son Percy. He’s just started at the Ministry — and

this is Fred — no, George, sorry — that’s Fred — Bill,

Charlie, Ron — my daughter, Ginny — and Ron’s

friends, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter.”

Bagman did the smallest of double takes when he

heard Harry’s name, and his eyes performed the

familiar flick upward to the scar on Harry’s forehead.

“Everyone,” Mr. Weasley continued, “this is Ludo

Bagman, you know who he is, it’s thanks to him we’ve

got such good tickets — ”

Bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it

had been nothing.

“Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?” he said

eagerly, jingling what seemed to be a large amount of

gold in the pockets of his yellow-and-black robes. “I’ve

already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will

score first — I offered him nice odds, considering

Ireland’s front three are the strongest I’ve seen in

years — and little Agatha Timms has put up half

shares in her eel farm on a week-long match.”

“Oh ... go on then,” said Mr. Weasley. “Let’s see ... a

Galleon on Ireland to win?”

“A Galleon?” Ludo Bagman looked slightly

disappointed, but recovered himself. “Very well, very

well . . . any other takers?”

“They’re a bit young to be gambling,” said Mr.

Weasley. “Molly wouldn’t like — ”

“Well bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three

Knuts,” said Fred as he and George quickly pooled all

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

their money, “that Ireland wins — but Viktor Krum

gets the Snitch. Oh and we’ll throw in a fake wand.”

“You don’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish

like that — ” Percy hissed, but Bagman didn’t seem to

think the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary,

his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it

from Fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk

and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared

with laughter.

“Excellent! I haven’t seen one that convincing in

years! I’d pay five Galleons for that!”

Percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval.

“Boys,” said Mr. Weasley under his breath, “I don’t

want you betting. ... That’s all your savings. ... Your

mother — ”

“Don’t be a spoilsport, Arthur!” boomed Ludo

Bagman, rattling his pockets excitedly. “They’re old

enough to know what they want! You reckon Ireland

will win but Krum ’ll get the Snitch? Not a chance,

boys, not a chance. ... I’ll give you excellent odds on

that one. ... We’ll add five Galleons for the funny

wand, then, shall we. ...”

Mr. Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman

whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting

down the twins’ names.

“Cheers,” said George, taking the slip of parchment

Bagman handed him and tucking it away carefully.

Bagman turned most cheerfully back to Mr. Weasley.

“Couldn’t do me a brew, I suppose? I’m keeping an

eye out for Barty Crouch. My Bulgarian opposite

number’s making difficulties, and I can’t understand

 

a word he’s saying. Barty’ll be able to sort it out. He

speaks about a hundred and fifty languages.”

“Mr. Crouch?” said Percy, suddenly abandoning his

look of poker-stiff disapproval and positively writhing

with excitement. “He speaks over two hundred!

Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll ...”

“Anyone can speak Troll,” said Fred dismissively. “All

you have to do is point and grunt.”

Percy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked

the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil.

“Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?” Mr. Weasley

asked as Bagman settled himself down on the grass

beside them all.

“Not a dicky bird,” said Bagman comfortably. “But

she’ll turn up. Poor old Bertha ... memory like a leaky

cauldron and no sense of direction. Lost, you take my

word for it. She’ll wander back into the office

sometime in October, thinking it’s still July.”

“You don’t think it might be time to send someone to

look for her?” Mr. Weasley suggested tentatively as

Percy handed Bagman his tea.

“Barty Crouch keeps saying that,” said Bagman, his

round eyes widening innocently, “but we really can’t

spare anyone at the moment. Oh — talk of the devil!

Barty!”

A wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he

could not have made more of a contrast with Ludo

Bagman, sprawled on the grass in his old Wasp

robes. Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man,

dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The

parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally

 

straight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked

as though he trimmed it using a slide rule. His shoes

were very highly polished. Harry could see at once

why Percy idolized him. Percy was a great believer in

rigidly following rules, and Mr. Crouch had complied

with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly

that he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry

doubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted him

for what he really was.

“Pull up a bit of grass, Barty,” said Ludo brightly,

patting the ground beside him.

“No thank you, Ludo,” said Crouch, and there was a

bite of impatience in his voice. “I’ve been looking for

you everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting we add

another twelve seats to the Top Box.”

“Oh is that what they’re after?” said Bagman. “I

thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of

tweezers. Bit of a strong accent.”

“Mr. Crouch!” said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a

kind of half-bow that made him look like a

hunchback. “Would you like a cup of tea?”

“Oh,” said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild

surprise. “Yes — thank you, Weatherby.”

Fred and George choked into their own cups. Percy,

very pink around the ears, busied himself with the

kettle.

“Oh and I’ve been wanting a word with you too,

Arthur,” said Mr. Crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon

Mr. Weasley. “Ali Bashir’s on the warpath. He wants a

word with you about your embargo on flying carpets.”

Mr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh.

 

“I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I’ve

told him once I’ve told him a hundred times: Carpets

are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of

Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?”

“I doubt it,” said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from

Percy. “He’s desperate to export here.”

“Well, they’ll never replace brooms in Britain, will

they?” said Bagman.

“Ali thinks there’s a niche in the market for a family

vehicle,” said Mr. Crouch. “I remember my

grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve

— but that was before carpets were banned, of

course.”

He spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any

doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the

law.

“So, been keeping busy, Barty?” said Bagman

breezily.

“Fairly,” said Mr. Crouch dryly. “Organizing Portkeys

across five continents is no mean feat, Ludo.”

“I expect you’ll both be glad when this is over?” said

Mr. Weasley.

Ludo Bagman looked shocked.

“Glad! Don’t know when I’ve had more fun. ... Still,

it’s not as though we haven’t got anything to look

forward to, eh, Barty? Eh? Plenty left to organize, eh?”

Mr. Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“We agreed not to make the announcement until all

the details — ”

“Oh details!” said Bagman, waving the word away like

a cloud of midges. “They’ve signed, haven’t they?

They’ve agreed, haven’t they? I bet you anything these

kids’ll know soon enough anyway. I mean, it’s

happening at Hogwarts — ”

“Ludo, we need to meet the Bulgarians, you know,”

said Mr. Crouch sharply, cutting Bagman’s remarks

short. “Thank you for the tea, Weatherby.”

He pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited

for Ludo to rise; Bagman struggled to his feet,

swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his

pockets chinking merrily.

“See you all later!” he said. “You’ll be up in the Top

Box with me — I’m commentating!” He waved, Barty

Crouch nodded curtly, and both of them

Disapparated.

“What’s happening at Hogwarts, Dad?” said Fred at

once. “What were they talking about?”

“You’ll find out soon enough,” said Mr.Weasley,

smiling.

“It’s classified information, until such time as the

Ministry decides to release it,” said Percy stiffly. “Mr.

Crouch was quite right not to disclose it.”

“Oh shut up, Weatherby,” said Fred.

A sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over

the campsite as the afternoon wore on. By dusk, the

still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with

anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain

 

over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last

vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed

to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting

the signs of blatant magic now breaking out

everywhere.

Salesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying

trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary

merchandise. There were luminous rosettes — green

for Ireland, red for Bulgaria — which were squealing

the names of the players, pointed green hats

bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves

adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both

countries that played their national anthems as they

were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that

really flew, and collectible figures of famous players,

which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening

themselves.

“Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,”

Ron told Harry as they and Hermione strolled through

the salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron

purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green

rosette, he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum,

the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum walked

backward and forward over Ron’s hand, scowling up

at the green rosette above him.

“Wow, look at these!” said Harry, hurrying over to a

cart piled high with what looked like brass

binoculars, except that they were covered with all

sorts of weird knobs and dials.

“Omnioculars,” said the saleswizard eagerly. “You can

replay action . . . slow everything down . . . and they

flash up a play-by-play breakdown if you need it.

Bargain — ten Galleons each.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Wish I hadn’t bought this now,” said Ron, gesturing

at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at

the Omnioculars.

“Three pairs,” said Harry firmly to the wizard.

“No — don’t bother,” said Ron, going red. He was

always touchy about the fact that Harry, who had

inherited a small fortune from his parents, had much

more money than he did.

“You won’t be getting anything for Christmas,” Harry

told him, thrusting Omnioculars into his and

Hermione’s hands. “For about ten years, mind.”

“Fair enough,” said Ron, grinning.

“Oooh, thanks, Harry,” said Hermione. “And I’ll get us

some programs, look — ”

Their money bags considerably lighter, they went

back to the tents. Bill, Charlie, and Ginny were all

sporting green rosettes too, and Mr. Weasley was

carrying an Irish flag. Fred and George had no

souvenirs as they had given Bagman all their gold.

And then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere

beyond the woods, and at once, green and red

lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to

the field.

“It’s time!” said Mr. Weasley, looking as excited as any

of them. “Come on, let’s go!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP

Clutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead,

they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-

lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of

people moving around them, shouts and laughter,

snatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish

excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn’t stop

grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty

minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they

emerged on the other side and found themselves in

the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry

could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls

surrounding the field, he could tell that ten

cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.

“Seats a hundred thousand,” said Mr. Weasley,

spotting the awestruck look on Harry’s face. “Ministry

task force of five hundred have been working on it all

year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it.

Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all

year, they’ve suddenly remembered urgent

appointments and had to dash away again . . . bless

them,” he added fondly, leading the way toward the

 

nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a

swarm of shouting witches and wizards.

“Prime seats!” said the Ministry witch at the entrance

when she checked their tickets. “Top Box! Straight

upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.”

The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich

purple. They clambered upward with the rest of the

crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into

the stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley’s party

kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the

staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at

the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly

halfway between the golden goal posts. About twenty

purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and

Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys,

looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could

never have imagined.

A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking

their places in the seats, which rose in levels around

the long oval field. Everything was suffused with a

mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from

the stadium itself. The field looked smooth as velvet

from their lofty position. At either end of the field

stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite

them, almost at Harry’s eye level, was a gigantic

blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as

though an invisible giant’s hand were scrawling upon

the blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching

it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements

across the field.

The Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family — safe,

reliable, and with Built-in Anti-Burglar Buzzer ... Mrs.

Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No Pain,

No Stain! ... Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris,

Hogsmeade ...

 

Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked

over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box

with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny

creature sitting in the second from last seat at the

end of the row behind them. The creature, whose legs

were so short they stuck out in front of it on the

chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and

it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long,

batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . .

“ Dobby ?” said Harry incredulously.

The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers,

revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact

size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn’t Dobby — it

was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry’s

friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free

from his old owners, the Malfoy family.

“Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf

curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was

higher even than Dobby’s had been, a teeny,

quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected —

though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf — that

this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione

spun around in their seats to look. Though they had

heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never

actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in

interest.

“Sorry,” Harry told the elf, “I just thought you were

someone I knew.”

“But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf. She

was shielding her face, as though blinded by light,

though the Top Box was not brightly lit. “My name is

Winky, sir — and you, sir — ” Her dark brown eyes

widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon

Harry’s scar. “You is surely Harry Potter!”

 

“Yeah, I am,” said Harry.

“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said,

lowering her hands very slightly and looking

awestruck.

“How is he?” said Harry. “How’s freedom suiting

him?”

“Ah, sir,” said Winky, shaking her head, “ah sir,

meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did

Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.”

“Why?” said Harry, taken aback. “What’s wrong with

him?”

“Freedom is going to Dobby’s head, sir,” said Winky

sadly. “Ideas above his station, sir. Can’t get another

position, sir.”

“Why not?” said Harry.

Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and

whispered, “He is wanting paying for his work, sir.”

“Paying?” said Harry blankly. “Well — why shouldn’t

he be paid?”

Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed

her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden

again.

“House-elves is not paid, sir!” she said in a muffled

squeak. “No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find

yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is

getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is

unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing

around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear

you’s up in front of the Department for the Regulation

 

and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common

goblin.”

“Well, it’s about time he had a bit of fun,” said Harry.

“House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry

Potter,” said Winky firmly, from behind her hands.

“House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking

heights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the

edge of the box and gulped — “but my master sends

me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”

“Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like

heights?” said Harry, frowning.

“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry

Potter. He is very busy,” said Winky, tilting her head

toward the empty space beside her. “Winky is wishing

she is back in master’s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky

does what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.”

She gave the edge of the box another frightened look

and hid her eyes completely again. Harry turned back

to the others.

“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered. “Weird things,

aren’t they?”

“Dobby was weirder,” said Harry fervently.

Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing

them, staring down into the crowd on the other side

of the stadium.

“Wild!” he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side.

“I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose

again ... and again ... and again ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through

her velvet-covered, tasseled program.

“ ‘A display from the team mascots will precede the

match,’ ” she read aloud.

“Oh that’s always worth watching,” said Mr. Weasley.

“National teams bring creatures from their native

land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.”

The box filled gradually around them over the next

half hour. Mr. Weasley kept shaking hands with

people who were obviously very important wizards.

Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as

though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog. When

Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself,

arrived, Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off

and shattered. Highly embarrassed, he repaired them

with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat,

throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius

Fudge had greeted like an old friend. They had met

before, and Fudge shook Harry’s hand in a fatherly

fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to

the wizards on either side of him.

“Harry Potter, you know,” he told the Bulgarian

minister loudly, who was wearing splendid robes of

black velvet trimmed with gold and didn’t seem to

understand a word of English. “Harry Potter ... oh

come on now, you know who he is . . . the boy who

survived You-Know-Who ... you do know who he is — ”

The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry’s scar

and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at

it.

“Knew we’d get there in the end,” said Fudge wearily

to Harry. “I’m no great shakes at languages; I need

Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see his

 

house-elf’s saving him a seat. ... Good job too, these

Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the

best places ... ah, and here’s Lucius!”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging

along the second row to three still-empty seats right

behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the

house-elf’s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son,

Draco; and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco’s

mother.

Harry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since

their very first journey to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a

pointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly

resembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall

and slim, she would have been nice-looking if she

hadn’t been wearing a look that suggested there was

a nasty smell under her nose.

“Ah, Fudge,” said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as

he reached the Minister of Magic. “How are you? I

don’t think you’ve met my wife, Narcissa? Or our son,

Draco?”

“How do you do, how do you do?” said Fudge, smiling

and bowing to Mrs. Malfoy. “And allow me to

introduce you to Mr. Oblansk — Obalonsk — Mr. —

well, he’s the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he

can’t understand a word I’m saying anyway, so never

mind. And let’s see who else — you know Arthur

Weasley, I daresay?”

It was a tense moment. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy

looked at each other and Harry vividly recalled the

last time they had come face-to-face: It had been in

Flourish and Blotts’ bookshop, and they had had a

fight. Mr. Malfoy’s cold gray eyes swept over Mr.

Weasley, and then up and down the row.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Good lord, Arthur,” he said softly. “What did you

have to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your

house wouldn’t have fetched this much?”

Fudge, who wasn’t listening, said, “Lucius has just

given a very generous contribution to St. Mungo’s

Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur.

He’s here as my guest.”

“How — how nice,” said Mr. Weasley, with a very

strained smile.

Mr. Malfoy’s eyes had returned to Hermione, who

went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at

him. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr.

Malfoy’s lip curl like that. The Malfoys prided

themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they

considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione,

second-class. However, under the gaze of the Minister

of Magic, Mr. Malfoy didn’t dare say anything. He

nodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley and continued

down the line to his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron,

and Hermione one contemptuous look, then settled

himself between his mother and father.

“Slimy gits,” Ron muttered as he, Harry, and

Hermione turned to face the field again. Next

moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box.

“Everyone ready?” he said, his round face gleaming

like a great, excited Edam. “Minister — ready to go?”

“Ready when you are, Ludo,” said Fudge comfortably.

Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own

throat, and said “Sonorusl” and then spoke over the

roar of sound that was now filling the packed

stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into

every corner of the stands.

 

“Ladies and gentlemen ... welcome! Welcome to the

final of the four hundred and twenty-second

Quidditch World Cup!”

The spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of

flags waved, adding their discordant national

anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite

them was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott’s

Every Flavor Beans — A Risk With Every Mouthfull)

and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.

“And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce

... the Bulgarian National Team Mascots!”

The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid

block of scarlet, roared its approval.

“I wonder what they’ve brought,” said Mr. Weasley,

leaning forward in his seat. “Aaah!” He suddenly

whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly

on his robes. “Veelal”

“What are veel — ?”

But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the

field, and Harry’s question was answered for him.

Veela were women . . . the most beautiful women Harry

had ever seen ... except that they weren’t — they

couldn’t be — human. This puzzled Harry for a

moment while he tried to guess what exactly they

could be; what could make their skin shine moon-

bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out

behind them without wind . . . but then the music

started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not

being human — in fact, he stopped worrying about

anything at all.

The veela had started to dance, and Harry’s mind had

gone completely and blissfully blank. All that

 

mattered in the world was that he kept watching the

veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things

would happen. ...

And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-

formed thoughts started chasing through Harry’s

dazed mind. He wanted to do something very

impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the

stadium seemed a good idea . . . but would it be good

enough?

“Harry, what are you doing?” said Hermione’s voice

from a long way off.

The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing

up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the

box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that

looked as though he were about to dive from a

springboard.

Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn’t

want the veela to go. Harry was with them; he would,

of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered

vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to

his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absent-mindedly

shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley,

smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the

hat out of his hands.

“You’ll be wanting that,” he said, “once Ireland have

had their say.”

“Huh?” said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela,

who had now lined up along one side of the field.

Hermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up

and pulled Harry back into his seat. “Honestlyl” she

said.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“And now,” roared Ludo Bagman’s voice, “kindly put

your wands in the air ... for the Irish National Team

Mascots!”

Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-

gold comet came zooming into the stadium. It did one

circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller

comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts. A

rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting

the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and

aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the

rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and

merged; they had formed a great shimmering

shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to

soar over the stands. Something like golden rain

seemed to be falling from it —

“Excellent!” yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over

them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing

off their heads and seats. Squinting up at the

shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually

comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men

with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or

green.

“Leprechauns!” said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous

applause of the crowd, many of whom were still

fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to

retrieve the gold.

“There you go,” Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of

gold coins into Harry’s hand, “for the Omnioculars!

Now you’ve got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!”

The great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns

drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from

the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to

watch the match.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome —

the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you —

Dimitrov!”

A scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast

it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an

entrance far below, to wild applause from the

Bulgarian supporters.

“Ivanova!”

A second scarlet-robed player zoomed out.

“Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand —

Krum\”

“That’s him, that’s him!” yelled Ron, following Krum

with his Omnioculars. Harry quickly focused his own.

Viktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with

a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He

looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to

believe he was only eighteen.

“And now, please greet — the Irish National Quidditch

Team!” yelled Bagman. “Presenting — Connolly! Ryan!

Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand — Lynch).”

Seven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a

small dial on the side of his Omnioculars and slowed

the players down enough to read the word “Firebolt”

on each of their brooms and see their names,

embroidered in silver, upon their backs.

“And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee,

acclaimed Chairwizard of the International

Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

A small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with

a mustache to rival Uncle Vernon’s, wearing robes of

pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the

field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the

mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate

under one arm, his broomstick under the other.

Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back

to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his

broomstick and kicked the crate open — four balls

burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black

Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment,

before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged

Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle,

Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.

“Theeeeeeeey’re OFF!” screamed Bagman. “And it’s

Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy!

Levski! Moran!”

It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played

before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to

his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of

his nose. The speed of the players was incredible —

the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another

so fast that Bagman only had time to say their

names. Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his

Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button

on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow

motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across

the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded

against his eardrums.

Hawkshead Attacking Formation, he read as he

watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely

together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet

and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians.

Porskoff Ploy flashed up next, as Troy made as though

to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the

Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to

 

Moran. One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung

hard at a passing Bludger with his small club,

knocking it into Moran’s path; Moran ducked to avoid

the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski,

soaring beneath, caught it —

“TROY SCORES!” roared Bagman, and the stadium

shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. “Ten

zero to Ireland!”

“What?” Harry yelled, looking wildly around through

his Omnioculars. “But Levski’s got the Quaffle!”

“Harry, if you’re not going to watch at normal speed,

you’re going to miss things!” shouted Hermione, who

was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air

while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry

looked quickly over the top of his Omni-oculars and

saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines

had all risen into the air again and formed the great,

glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were

watching them sulkily.

Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back

to normal as play resumed.

Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the

Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a

seamless team, their movements so well coordinated

that they appeared to be reading one another’s minds

as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on

Harry’s chest kept squeaking their names: “Troy —

Mullet — Moran).” And within ten minutes, Ireland had

scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero

and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause

from the green-clad supporters.

The match became still faster, but more brutal.

Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were

 

whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the

Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from

using some of their best moves; twice they were forced

to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to

break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan;

and score Bulgaria’s first goal.

“Fingers in your ears!” bellowed Mr. Weasley as the

veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed

up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the

game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the

field. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria

was again in possession of the Quaffle.

“Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova — oh I say!”

roared Bagman.

One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two

Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the

center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though

they had just jumped from airplanes without

parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his

Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was

“They’re going to crash!” screamed Hermione next to

Harry.

She was half right — at the very last second, Viktor

Krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch,

however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could

be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose

from the Irish seats.

“Fool!” moaned Mr. Weasley. “Krum was feinting!”

“It’s time-out!” yelled Bagman’s voice, “as trained

mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan

Lynch!”

 

“He’ll be okay, he only got ploughed!” Charlie said

reassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side

of the box, looking horror-struck. “Which is what

Krum was after, of course. ...”

Harry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play

buttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial,

and put them back up to his eyes.

He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow

motion. Wronski Defensive Feint — dangerous Seeker

diversion read the shining purple lettering across his

lenses. He saw Krum’s face contorted with

concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in

time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood

— Krum hadn’t seen the Snitch at all, he was just

making Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen

anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he

was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily

through the air that he looked unsupported and

weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to

normal and focused them on Krum. He was now

circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by

mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still

more closely upon Krum’s face, saw his dark eyes

darting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He

was using the time while Lynch was revived to look

for the Snitch without interference.

Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the

green-clad supporters, mounted his Firebolt, and

kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give

Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle

again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill

unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.

After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland

had pulled ahead by ten more goals. They were now

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and

the game was starting to get dirtier.

As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again,

clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the

Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her.

Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn’t

catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd,

and Mostafa’s long, shrill whistle blast, told him it

had been a foul.

“And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for

cobbing — excessive use of elbows!” Bagman informed

the roaring spectators. “And — yes, it’s a penalty to

Ireland!”

The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air

like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had

been fouled, now darted together to form the words

“HA, HA, HA!” The veela on the other side of the field

leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and

started to dance again.

As one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their

fingers into their ears, but Hermione, who hadn’t

bothered, was soon tugging on Harry’s arm. He

turned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers

impatiently out of his ears.

“Look at the referee!” she said, giggling.

Harry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had

landed right in front of the dancing veela, and was

acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles

and smoothing his mustache excitedly.

“Now, we can’t have that!” said Ludo Bagman, though

he sounded highly amused. “Somebody slap the

referee!”

 

A mediwizard came tearing across the field, his

fingers stuffed into his own ears, and kicked Mostafa

hard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself;

Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw

that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had

started shouting at the veela, who had stopped

dancing and were looking mutinous.

“And unless I’m much mistaken, Mostafa is actually

attempting to send off the Bulgarian team mascots!”

said Bagman’s voice. “Now there’s something we

haven’t seen before. ... Oh this could turn nasty. ...”

It did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov,

landed on either side of Mostafa and began arguing

furiously with him, gesticulating toward the

leprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words

“HEE, HEE, HEE.” Mostafa was not impressed by the

Bulgarians’ arguments, however; he was jabbing his

finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying

again, and when they refused, he gave two short

blasts on his whistle.

“Two penalties for Ireland!” shouted Bagman, and the

Bulgarian crowd howled with anger. “And Volkov and

Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms . . .

yes ... there they go ... and Troy takes the Quaffle ...”

Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything

they had yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were

acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in

particular seemed not to care whether their clubs

made contact with Bludger or human as they swung

them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight

at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her

off her broom.

“Foul\” roared the Irish supporters as one, all

standing up in a great wave of green.

 

“Foul!” echoed Ludo Bagman’s magically magnified

voice. “Dimitrov skins Moran — deliberately flying to

collide there — and it’s got to be another penalty —

yes, there’s the whistle!”

The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this

time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a

very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At

this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they

launched themselves across the field and began

throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the

leprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars,

Harry saw that they didn’t look remotely beautiful

now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into

sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings

were bursting from their shoulders —

“And that, boys,” yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult

of the crowd below, “is why you should never go for

looks alone!”

Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to

separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little

success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was

nothing to the one taking place above. Harry turned

this way and that, staring through his Omnioculars,

as the Quaffle changed hands with the speed of a

bullet.

“Levski — Dimitrov — Moran — Troy — Mullet —

Ivanova — Moran again — Moran — MORAN

SCORES!”

But the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely

heard over the shrieks of the veela, the blasts now

issuing from the Ministry members’ wands, and the

furious roars of the Bulgarians. The game

recommenced immediately; now Levski had the

Quaffle, now Dimitrov —

 

The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing

Bludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum,

who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in

the face.

There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum’s

nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but

Hassan Mostafa didn’t blow his whistle. He had

become distracted, and Harry couldn’t blame him;

one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set

his broom tail alight.

Harry wanted someone to realize that Krum was

injured; even though he was supporting Ireland,

Krum was the most exciting player on the field. Ron

obviously felt the same.

“Time-out! Ah, come on, he can’t play like that, look

at him — ”

“Look at Lynch 1” Harry yelled.

For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive,

and Harry was quite sure that this was no Wronski

Feint; this was the real thing. ...

“He’s seen the Snitch!” Harry shouted. “He’s seen it!

Look at him go!”

Half the crowd seemed to have realized what was

happening; the Irish supporters rose in another great

wave of green, screaming their Seeker on . . . but Krum

was on his tail. How he could see where he was going,

Harry had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying

through the air behind him, but he was drawing level

with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward

the ground again —

“They’re going to crash!” shrieked Hermione.

 

“They’re not!” roared Ron.

“Lynch is!” yelled Harry.

And he was right — for the second time, Lynch hit the

ground with tremendous force and was immediately

stampeded by a horde of angry veela.

“The Snitch, where’s the Snitch?” bellowed Charlie,

along the row.

“He’s got it — Krum’s got it — it’s all over!” shouted

Harry.

Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose,

was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint

of gold in his hand.

The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160,

IRELAND: 170 across the crowd, who didn’t seem to

have realized what had happened. Then, slowly, as

though a great jumbo jet were revving up, the

rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and

louder and erupted into screams of delight.

“IRELAND WINS!” Bagman shouted, who like the

Irish, seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of

the match. “KRUM GETS THE SNITCH — BUT

IRELAND WINS — good lord, I don’t think any of us

were expecting that!”

“What did he catch the Snitch for?” Ron bellowed,

even as he jumped up and down, applauding with his

hands over his head. “He ended it when Ireland were

a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!”

“He knew they were never going to catch up!” Harry

shouted back over all the noise, also applauding

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

loudly. “The Irish Chasers were too good. ... He

wanted to end it on his terms, that’s all. ...”

“He was very brave, wasn’t he?” Hermione said,

leaning forward to watch Krum land as a swarm of

mediwizards blasted a path through the battling

leprechauns and veela to get to him. “He looks a

terrible mess. ...”

Harry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was

hard to see what was happening below, because

leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the

field, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded

by mediwizards. He looked surlier than ever and

refused to let them mop him up. His team members

were around him, shaking their heads and looking

dejected; a short way away, the Irish players were

dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from

their mascots. Flags were waving all over the stadium,

the Irish national anthem blared from all sides; the

veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful

selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn.

“Veil, ve fought bravely,” said a gloomy voice behind

Harry. He looked around; it was the Bulgarian

Minister of Magic.

“You can speak English!” said Fudge, sounding

outraged. “And you’ve been letting me mime

everything all day!”

“Veil, it vos very funny,” said the Bulgarian minister,

shrugging.

“And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor,

flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup

itself is brought into the Top Box!” roared Bagman.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry’s eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding

white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated

so that everyone in the stands could see the inside.

Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting

wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box,

which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still

looking very disgruntled that he’d been using sign

language all day for nothing.

“Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers —

Bulgaria!” Bagman shouted.

And up the stairs into the box came the seven

defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below was

applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands

and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and

winking in their direction.

One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of

seats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of

each as they shook hands with their own minister

and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line,

looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming

spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding

the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less

coordinated on the ground. He was slightly duck-

footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when

Krum’s name was announced, the whole stadium

gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.

And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being

supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash

seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked

strangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy

and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd

below thundered its approval. Harry’s hands were

numb with clapping.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

At last, when the Irish team had left the box to

perform another lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan

Lynch on the back of Connolly’s, clutching hard

around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort

of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and

muttered, “Quietus.”

“They’ll be talking about this one for years,” he said

hoarsely, “a really unexpected twist, that. ... shame it

couldn’t have lasted longer. ... Ah yes. ... yes, I owe

you . . . how much?”

For Fred and George had just scrambled over the

backs of their seats and were standing in front of

Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their

hands outstretched.

THE DARK MARK

“ Don’t tell your mother you’ve been gambling,” Mr.

Weasley implored Fred and George as they all made

their way slowly down the purple-carpeted stairs.

“Don’t worry, Dad,” said Fred gleefully, “we’ve got big

plans for this money. We don’t want it confiscated.”

Mr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was

going to ask what these big plans were, but seemed to

decide, upon reflection, that he didn’t want to know.

They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding

out of the stadium and back to their campsites.

Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night

air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit

path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads,

cackling and waving their lanterns. When they finally

reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and

given the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley

agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa

together before turning in. They were soon arguing

enjoyably about the match; Mr. Weasley got drawn

 

into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and

it was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny

table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that

Mr. Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and

insisted that everyone go to bed. Hermione and Ginny

went into the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the

Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into

their bunks. From the other side of the campsite they

could still hear much singing and the odd echoing

bang.

“Oh I am glad I’m not on duty,” muttered Mr. Weasley

sleepily. “I wouldn’t fancy having to go and tell the

Irish they’ve got to stop celebrating.”

Harry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring

up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow

of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead,

and picturing again some of Krum’s more spectacular

moves. He was itching to get back on his own Firebolt

and try out the Wronski Feint. ... Somehow Oliver

Wood had never managed to convey with all his

wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to

look like. ... Harry saw himself in robes that had his

name on the back, and imagined the sensation of

hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as

Ludo Bagman’s voice echoed throughout the stadium,

“I give you ... PotteA.”

Harry never knew whether or not he had actually

dropped off to sleep — his fantasies of flying like

Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams —

all he knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr. Weasley

was shouting.

“Get up! Ron — Harry — come on now, get up, this is

urgent!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit

canvas.

“ ’S’ matter?” he said.

Dimly, he could tell that something was wrong. The

noises in the campsite had changed. The singing had

stopped. He could hear screams, and the sound of

people running. He slipped down from the bunk and

reached for his clothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had

pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, “No

time, Harry — just grab a jacket and get outside —

quickly!”

Harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent,

Ron at his heels.

By the light of the few fires that were still burning, he

could see people running away into the woods, fleeing

something that was moving across the field toward

them, something that was emitting odd flashes of

light and noises like gunfire. Loud jeering, roars of

laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward

them; then came a burst of strong green light, which

illuminated the scene.

A crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving

together with wands pointing straight upward, was

marching slowly across the field. Harry squinted at

them. ... They didn’t seem to have faces. ... Then he

realized that their heads were hooded and their faces

masked. High above them, floating along in midair,

four struggling figures were being contorted into

grotesque shapes. It was as though the masked

wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the

people above them were marionettes operated by

invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air.

Two of the figures were very small.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

More wizards were joining the marching group,

laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies. Tents

crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled.

Once or twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a

tent out of his way with his wand. Several caught fire.

The screaming grew louder.

The floating people were suddenly illuminated as they

passed over a burning tent and Harry recognized one

of them: Mr. Roberts, the campsite manager. The

other three looked as though they might be his wife

and children. One of the marchers below flipped Mrs.

Roberts upside down with his wand; her nightdress

fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she

struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her

screeched and hooted with glee.

“That’s sick,” Ron muttered, watching the smallest

Muggle child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty

feet above the ground, his head flopping limply from

side to side. “That is really sick. ...”

Hermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them,

pulling coats over their nightdresses, with Mr.

Weasley right behind them. At the same moment, Bill,

Charlie, and Percy emerged from the boys’ tent, fully

dressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands

out.

“We’re going to help the Ministry!” Mr. Weasley

shouted over all the noise, rolling up his own sleeves.

“You lot — get into the woods, and stick together. I’ll

come and fetch you when we’ve sorted this out!”

Bill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away

toward the oncoming marchers; Mr. Weasley tore

after them. Ministry wizards were dashing from every

direction toward the source of the trouble. The crowd

beneath the Roberts family was coming ever closer.

 

“C’mon,” said Fred, grabbing Ginny’s hand and

starting to pull her toward the wood. Harry, Ron,

Hermione, and George followed. They all looked back

as they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the

Roberts family was larger than ever; they could see

the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the

hooded wizards in the center, but they were having

great difficulty. It looked as though they were scared

to perform any spell that might make the Roberts

family fall.

The colored lanterns that had lit the path to the

stadium had been extinguished. Dark figures were

blundering through the trees; children were crying;

anxious shouts and panicked voices were

reverberating around them in the cold night air.

Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by

people whose faces he could not see. Then he heard

Ron yell with pain.

“What happened?” said Hermione anxiously, stopping

so abruptly that Harry walked into her. “Ron, where

are you? Oh this is stupid — lumos\”

She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow

beam across the path. Ron was lying sprawled on the

ground.

“Tripped over a tree root,” he said angrily, getting to

his feet again.

“Well, with feet that size, hard not to,” said a drawling

voice from behind them.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco

Malfoy was standing alone nearby, leaning against a

tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he

seemed to have been watching the scene at the

campsite through a gap in the trees.

 

Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he

would never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley

“Language, Weasley,” said Malfoy, his pale eyes

glittering. “Hadn’t you better be hurrying along, now?

You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?”

He nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a

blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a

flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around

them.

“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Hermione

defiantly.

“Granger, they’re after Muggles,” said Malfoy. “D’you

want to be showing off your knickers in midair?

Because if you do, hang around ... they’re moving this

way, and it would give us all a laugh.”

“Hermione’s a witch,” Harry snarled.

“Have it your own way, Potter,” said Malfoy, grinning

maliciously. “If you think they can’t spot a Mudblood,

stay where you are.”

“You watch your mouth!” shouted Ron. Everybody

present knew that “Mudblood” was a very offensive

term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage.

“Never mind, Ron,” said Hermione quickly, seizing

Ron’s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward

Malfoy.

There came a bang from the other side of the trees

that was louder than anything they had heard.

Several people nearby screamed. Malfoy chuckled

softly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Scare easily, don’t they?” he said lazily. “I suppose

your daddy told you all to hide? What’s he up to —

trying to rescue the Muggles?”

“Where’re your parents?” said Harry, his temper

rising. “Out there wearing masks, are they?”

Malfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.

“Well ... if they were, I wouldn’t be likely to tell you,

would I, Potter?”

“Oh come on,” said Hermione, with a disgusted look

at Malfoy, “let’s go and find the others.”

“Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,” sneered

Malfoy.

“Come on,” Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry

and Ron up the path again.

“I’ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked

lot!” said Ron hotly.

“Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!”

said Hermione fervently. “Oh I can’t believe this.

Where have the others got to?”

Fred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen,

though the path was packed with plenty of other

people, all looking nervously over their shoulders

toward the commotion back at the campsite. A huddle

of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a

little way along the path. When they saw Harry, Ron,

and Hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and

said quickly, “ Ou est Madame Maxime? Nous Vavons

perdue — ”

“Er — what?” said Ron.

 

“Oh ...” The girl who had spoken turned her back on

him, and as they walked on they distinctly heard her

say, “ ’Ogwarts.”

“Beauxbatons,” muttered Hermione.

“Sorry?” said Harry.

“They must go to Beauxbatons,” said Hermione. “You

know . . . Beauxbatons Academy of Magic ... I read

about it in An Appraisal of Magical Education in

Europe.”

“Oh ... yeah ... right,” said Harry.

“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said Ron,

pulling out his wand, lighting it like Hermione’s, and

squinting up the path. Harry dug in the pockets of his

jacket for his own wand — but it wasn’t there. The

only thing he could find was his Omnioculars.

“Ah, no, I don’t believe it ... I’ve lost my wand!”

“You’re kidding!”

Ron and Hermione raised their wands high enough to

spread the narrow beams of light farther on the

ground; Harry looked all around him, but his wand

was nowhere to be seen.

“Maybe it’s back in the tent,” said Ron.

“Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were

running?” Hermione suggested anxiously.

“Yeah,” said Harry, “maybe ...”

He usually kept his wand with him at all times in the

wizarding world, and finding himself without it in the

 

midst of a scene like this made him feel very

vulnerable.

A rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump.

Winky the house-elf was fighting her way out of a

clump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a most

peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it

was as though someone invisible were trying to hold

her back.

“There is bad wizards about!” she squeaked

distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to

keep running. “People high — high in the air! Winky

is getting out of the way!”

And she disappeared into the trees on the other side

of the path, panting and squeaking as she fought the

force that was restraining her.

“What’s up with her?” said Ron, looking curiously

after Winky. “Why can’t she run properly?”

“Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide,” said Harry.

He was thinking of Dobby: Every time he had tried to

do something the Malfoys wouldn’t like, the house-elf

had been forced to start beating himself up.

“You know, house-elves get a very raw deal!” said

Hermione indignantly. “It’s slavery, that’s what it is!

That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the

stadium, and she was terrified, and he’s got her

bewitched so she can’t even run when they start

trampling tents! Why doesn’t anyone do something

about it?”

“Well, the elves are happy, aren’t they?” Ron said.

“You heard old Winky back at the match ... ‘House-

elves is not supposed to have fun’ ... that’s what she

likes, being bossed around. ...”

 

“It’s people like you, Ron,” Hermione began hotly,

“who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just

because they’re too lazy to — ”

Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.

“Let’s just keep moving, shall we?” said Ron, and

Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione. Perhaps

there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps

Hermione was in more danger than they were. They

set off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even

though he knew his wand wasn’t there.

They followed the dark path deeper into the wood,

still keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny.

They passed a group of goblins who were cackling

over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won

betting on the match, and who seemed quite

unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther

still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery

light, and when they looked through the trees, they

saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a

clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all

of whom were talking very loudly.

“I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a

year!” one of them shouted. “I’m a dragon killer for

the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous

Creatures.”

“No, you’re not!” yelled his friend. “You’re a

dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron. ... but I’m a

vampire hunter, I’ve killed about ninety so far — ”

A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even

by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, “I’m

about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic,

I am.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry snorted with laughter. He recognized the

pimply wizard: His name was Stan Shunpike, and he

was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight

Bus. He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron’s face had

gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling,

“Did I tell you I’ve invented a broomstick that’ll reach

Jupiter?”

“Honestly\” said Hermione, and she and Harry

grabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around,

and marched him away. By the time the sounds of

the veela and their admirers had faded completely,

they were in the very heart of the wood. They seemed

to be alone now; everything was much quieter.

Harry looked around. “I reckon we can just wait here,

you know. Well hear anyone coming a mile off.”

The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo

Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of

them.

Even by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could

see that a great change had come over Bagman. He

no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was

no more spring in his step. He looked very white and

strained.

“Who’s that?” he said, blinking down at them, trying

to make out their faces. “What are you doing in here,

all alone?”

They looked at one another, surprised.

“Well — there’s a sort of riot going on,” said Ron.

Bagman stared at him.

“What?”

 

“At the campsite . . . some people have got hold of a

family of Muggles. ...”

Bagman swore loudly.

“Damn them!” he said, looking quite distracted, and

without another word, he Disapparated with a small

pop\

“Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?”

said Hermione, frowning.

“He was a great Beater, though,” said Ron, leading

the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting

down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree.

“The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in

a row while he was with them.”

He took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set

it down on the ground, and watched it walk around.

Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duck-

footed and round-shouldered, much less impressive

on his splayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was

listening for noise from the campsite. Everything

seemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.

“I hope the others are okay,” said Hermione after a

while.

“They’ll be fine,” said Ron.

“Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,” said

Harry, sitting down next to Ron and watching the

small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves.

“He’s always said he’d like to get something on him.”

“That’d wipe the smirk off old Draco’s face, all right,”

said Ron.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Those poor Muggles, though,” said Hermione

nervously. “What if they can’t get them down?”

“They will,” said Ron reassuringly. “They’ll find a

way.”

“Mad, though, to do something like that when the

whole Ministry of Magic’s out here tonight!” said

Hermione. “I mean, how do they expect to get away

with it? Do you think they’ve been drinking, or are

they just — ”

But she broke off abruptly and looked over her

shoulder. Harry and Ron looked quickly around too.

It sounded as though someone was staggering toward

their clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of

the uneven steps behind the dark trees. But the

footsteps came to a sudden halt.

“Hello?” called Harry.

There was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered

around the tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he

could sense somebody standing just beyond the range

of his vision.

“Who’s there?” he said.

And then, without warning, the silence was rent by a

voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it

uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like

a spell.

“MORSMORDREl ”

And something vast, green, and glittering erupted

from the patch of darkness Harry’s eyes had been

struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops

and into the sky.

 

“What the — ?” gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet

again, staring up at the thing that had appeared.

For a split second, Harry thought it was another

leprechaun formation. Then he realized that it was a

colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald

stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a

tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher,

blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against

the black sky like a new constellation.

Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with

screams. Harry didn’t understand why, but the only

possible cause was the sudden appearance of the

skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate

the entire wood like some grisly neon sign. He

scanned the darkness for the person who had

conjured the skull, but he couldn’t see anyone.

“Who’s there?” he called again.

“Harry, come on, move\” Hermione had seized the

collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward.

“What’s the matter?” Harry said, startled to see her

face so white and terrified.

“It’s the Dark Mark, Harry!” Hermione moaned,

pulling him as hard as she could. “You-Know-Who’s

sign!”

“Voldemort’s — ?”

“Harry, come on!”

Harry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his

miniature Krum — the three of them started across

the clearing — but before they had taken a few

hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced

 

the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air,

surrounding them.

Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he

registered one fact: Each of these wizards had his

wand out, and every wand was pointing right at

himself, Ron, and Hermione.

Without pausing to think, he yelled, “DUCK!”

He seized the other two and pulled them down onto

the ground.

“STUPEFYl” roared twenty voices — there was a

blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on

his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept

the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he

saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the

wizards’ wands, crossing one another, bouncing off

tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness —

“Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized. “STOP! That’s my

son\”

Harry’s hair stopped blowing about. He raised his

head a little higher. The wizard in front of him had

lowered his wand. He rolled over and saw Mr. Weasley

striding toward them, looking terrified.

“Ron — Harry” — his voice sounded shaky —

“Hermione — are you all right?”

“Out of the way, Arthur,” said a cold, curt voice.

It was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards

were closing in on them. Harry got to his feet to face

them. Mr. Crouch’s face was taut with rage.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Which of you did it?” he snapped, his sharp eyes

darting between them. “Which of you conjured the

Dark Mark?”

“We didn’t do that!” said Harry, gesturing up at the

skull.

“We didn’t do anything!” said Ron, who was rubbing

his elbow and looking indignantly at his father. “What

did you want to attack us for?”

“Do not lie, sir!” shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was

still pointing directly at Ron, and his eyes were

popping — he looked slightly mad. “You have been

discovered at the scene of the crime!”

“Barty,” whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing

gown, “they’re kids, Barty, they’d never have been

able to — ”

“Where did the Mark come from, you three?” said Mr.

Weasley quickly.

“Over there,” said Hermione shakily, pointing at the

place where they had heard the voice. “There was

someone behind the trees . . . they shouted words —

an incantation — ”

“Oh, stood over there, did they?” said Mr. Crouch,

turning his popping eyes on Hermione now, disbelief

etched all over his face. “Said an incantation, did

they? You seem very well informed about how that

Mark is summoned, missy — ”

But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr.

Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry,

Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the

contrary, at Hermione’s words, they had all raised

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

their wands again and were pointing in the direction

she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.

“We’re too late,” said the witch in the woolen dressing

gown, shaking her head. “They’ll have Disapparated.”

“I don’t think so,” said a wizard with a scrubby brown

beard. It was Amos Diggory, Cedric’s father. “Our

Stunners went right through those trees. ... There’s a

good chance we got them. ...”

“Amos, be careful!” said a few of the wizards

warningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders,

raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and

disappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched

him vanish with her hands over her mouth.

A few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout.

“Yes! We got them! There’s someone here!

Unconscious! It’s — but — blimey ...”

“You’ve got someone?” shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding

highly disbelieving. “Who? Who is it?”

They heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and

then crunching footsteps as Mr. Diggory reemerged

from behind the trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp

figure in his arms. Harry recognized the tea towel at

once. It was Winky.

Mr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory

deposited his elf on the ground at his feet. The other

Ministry wizards were all staring at Mr. Crouch. For a

few seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes

blazing in his white face as he stared down at Winky.

Then he appeared to come to life again.

“This — cannot — be,” he said jerkily. “No — ”

 

He moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off

toward the place where he had found Winky.

“No point, Mr. Crouch,” Mr. Diggory called after him.

“There’s no one else there.”

But Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his

word for it. They could hear him moving around and

the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside,

searching.

“Bit embarrassing,” Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking

down at Winky’s unconscious form. “Barty Crouch’s

house-elf ... I mean to say ...”

“Come off it, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “you

don’t seriously think it was the elf? The Dark Mark’s a

wizard’s sign. It requires a wand.”

“Yeah,” said Mr. Diggory, “and she had a wand.”

“What?” said Mr. Weasley.

“Here, look.” Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed

it to Mr. Weasley. “Had it in her hand. So that’s

clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken, for a

start. No non-human creature is permitted to carry or

use a wand.”

Just then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman

Apparated right next to Mr. Weasley. Looking

breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot,

goggling upward at the emerald-green skull.

“The Dark Mark!” he panted, almost trampling Winky

as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues. “Who did

it? Did you get them? Barty! What’s going on?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Mr. Crouch had returned empty-handed. His face was

still ghostly white, and his hands and his toothbrush

mustache were both twitching.

“Where have you been, Barty?” said Bagman. “Why

weren’t you at the match? Your elf was saving you a

seat too — gulping gargoyles!” Bagman had just

noticed Winky lying at his feet. “What happened to

her?”

“I have been busy, Ludo,” said Mr. Crouch, still

talking in the same jerky fashion, barely moving his

lips. “And my elf has been stunned.”

“Stunned? By you lot, you mean? But why — ?”

Comprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman’s

round, shiny face; he looked up at the skull, down at

Winky, and then at Mr. Crouch.

“iVo!” he said. “Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She

wouldn’t know how! She’d need a wand, for a start!”

“And she had one,” said Mr. Diggory. “I found her

holding one, Ludo. If it’s all right with you, Mr.

Crouch, I think we should hear what she’s got to say

for herself.”

Crouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory,

but Mr. Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent.

He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and

said, “Rennervatel”

Winky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened

and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of

way. Watched by the silent wizards, she raised herself

shakily into a sitting position. She caught sight of Mr.

Diggory’s feet, and slowly, tremulously, raised her

eyes to stare up into his face; then, more slowly still,

 

she looked up into the sky. Harry could see the

floating skull reflected twice in her enormous, glassy

eyes. She gave a gasp, looked wildly around the

crowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs.

“Elf!” said Mr. Diggory sternly. “Do you know who I

am? I’m a member of the Department for the

Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures!”

Winky began to rock backward and forward on the

ground, her breath coming in sharp bursts. Harry

was reminded forcibly of Dobby in his moments of

terrified disobedience.

“As you see, elf, the Dark Mark was conjured here a

short while ago,” said Mr. Diggory. “And you were

discovered moments later, right beneath it! An

explanation, if you please!”

“I — I — I is not doing it, sir!” Winky gasped. “I is not

knowing how, sir!”

“You were found with a wand in your hand!” barked

Mr. Diggory, brandishing it in front of her. And as the

wand caught the green light that was filling the

clearing from the skull above, Harry recognized it.

“Hey — that’s mine!” he said.

Everyone in the clearing looked at him.

“Excuse me?” said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.

“That’s my wand!” said Harry. “I dropped it!”

“You dropped it?” repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief.

“Is this a confession? You threw it aside after you

conjured the Mark?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Amos, think who you’re talking to!” said Mr. Weasley,

very angrily. “Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the

Dark Mark?”

“Er — of course not,” mumbled Mr. Diggory. “Sorry ...

carried away ...”

“I didn’t drop it there, anyway,” said Harry, jerking

his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull. “I

missed it right after we got into the wood.”

“So,” said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he

turned to look at Winky again, cowering at his feet.

“You found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it up

and thought you’d have some fun with it, did you?”

“I is not doing magic with it, sir!” squealed Winky,

tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and

bulbous nose. “I is ... I is ... I is just picking it up, sir!

I is not making the Dark Mark, sir, I is not knowing

how!”

“It wasn’t her!” said Hermione. She looked very

nervous, speaking up in front of all these Ministry

wizards, yet determined all the same. “Winky’s got a

squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the

incantation was much deeper!” She looked around at

Harry and Ron, appealing for their support. “It didn’t

sound anything like Winky, did it?”

“No,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It definitely didn’t

sound like an elf.”

“Yeah, it was a human voice,” said Ron.

“Well, we’ll soon see,” growled Mr. Diggory, looking

unimpressed. “There’s a simple way of discovering the

last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know that?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Winky trembled and shook her head frantically, her

ears flapping, as Mr. Diggory raised his own wand

again and placed it tip to tip with Harry’s.

“ Prior Incantatol” roared Mr. Diggory.

Harry heard Hermione gasp, horrified, as a gigantic

serpent-tongued skull erupted from the point where

the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of the

green skull high above them; it looked as though it

were made of thick gray smoke: the ghost of a spell.

“Deletrius\” Mr. Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull

vanished in a wisp of smoke.

“So,” said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph,

looking down upon Winky, who was still shaking

convulsively.

“I is not doing it!” she squealed, her eyes rolling in

terror. “I is not, I is not, I is not knowing how! I is a

good elf, I isn’t using wands, I isn’t knowing how!”

“ You’ve been caught red-handed, elf.” Mr. Diggory

roared. “Caught with the guilty wand in your hand\”

“Amos,” said Mr. Weasley loudly, “think about it ...

precious few wizards know how to do that spell. ...

Where would she have learned it?”

“Perhaps Amos is suggesting,” said Mr. Crouch, cold

anger in every syllable, “that I routinely teach my

servants to conjure the Dark Mark?”

There was a deeply unpleasant silence. Amos Diggory

looked horrified. “Mr. Crouch ... not ... not at all ...”

“You have now come very close to accusing the two

people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure

 

that Mark!” barked Mr. Crouch. “Harry Potter — and

myself! I suppose you are familiar with the boy’s

story, Amos?”

“Of course — everyone knows — ” muttered Mr.

Diggory, looking highly discomforted.

“And I trust you remember the many proofs I have

given, over a long career, that I despise and detest the

Dark Arts and those who practice them?” Mr. Crouch

shouted, his eyes bulging again.

“Mr. Crouch, I — I never suggested you had anything

to do with it!” Amos Diggory muttered again, now

reddening behind his scrubby brown beard.

“If you accuse my elf, you accuse me, Diggory!”

shouted Mr. Crouch. “Where else would she have

learned to conjure it?”

“She — she might’ve picked it up anywhere — ”

“Precisely, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley. “ She might have

picked it up anywhere. ... Winky?” he said kindly,

turning to the elf, but she flinched as though he too

was shouting at her. “Where exactly did you find

Harry’s wand?”

Winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so

violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers.

“I — I is finding it ... finding it there, sir. ...” she

whispered, “there ... in the trees, sir. ...”

“You see, Amos?” said Mr. Weasley. “Whoever

conjured the Mark could have Disapparated right

after they’d done it, leaving Harry’s wand behind. A

clever thing to do, not using their own wand, which

could have betrayed them. And Winky here had the

 

misfortune to come across the wand moments later

and pick it up.”

“But then, she’d have been only a few feet away from

the real culprit!” said Mr. Diggory impatiently. “Elf?

Did you see anyone?”

Winky began to tremble worse than ever. Her giant

eyes flickered from Mr. Diggory, to Ludo Bagman, and

onto Mr. Crouch. Then she gulped and said, “I is

seeing no one, sir ... no one ...”

“Amos,” said Mr. Crouch curtly, “I am fully aware

that, in the ordinary course of events, you would want

to take Winky into your department for questioning. I

ask you, however, to allow me to deal with her.”

Mr. Diggory looked as though he didn’t think much of

this suggestion at all, but it was clear to Harry that

Mr. Crouch was such an important member of the

Ministry that he did not dare refuse him.

“You may rest assured that she will be punished,” Mr.

Crouch added coldly.

“M-m-master ...” Winky stammered, looking up at Mr.

Crouch, her eyes brimming with tears. “M-m-master,

p-p-please ...”

Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow

sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched.

There was no pity in his gaze.

“Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not

have believed possible,” he said slowly. “I told her to

remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I

went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she

disobeyed me. This means clothes.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr.

Crouch’s feet. “No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!”

Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free

was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful

to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she

sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet.

“But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily,

glaring at Mr. Crouch. “Your elf’s scared of heights,

and those wizards in masks were levitating people!

You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their

way!”

Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself

from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as

though she were something filthy and rotten that was

contaminating his over-shined shoes.

“I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,” he

said coldly, looking over at Hermione. “I have no use

for a servant who forgets what is due to her master,

and to her master’s reputation.”

Winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed

around the clearing. There was a very nasty silence,

which was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly,

“Well, I think I’ll take my lot back to the tent, if

nobody’s got any objections. Amos, that wand’s told

us all it can — if Harry could have it back, please — ”

Mr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry

pocketed it.

“Come on, you three,” Mr. Weasley said quietly. But

Hermione didn’t seem to want to move; her eyes were

still upon the sobbing elf. “Hermione!” Mr. Weasley

said, more urgently. She turned and followed Harry

and Ron out of the clearing and off through the trees.

 

“What’s going to happen to Winky?” said Hermione,

the moment they had left the clearing.

“I don’t know,” said Mr. Weasley.

“The way they were treating her!” said Hermione

furiously. “Mr. Diggory, calling her ‘elf’ all the time ...

and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn’t do it and he’s

still going to sack her! He didn’t care how frightened

she’d been, or how upset she was — it was like she

wasn’t even human!”

“Well, she’s not,” said Ron.

Hermione rounded on him.

“That doesn’t mean she hasn’t got feelings, Ron. It’s

disgusting the way — ”

“Hermione, I agree with you,” said Mr. Weasley

quickly, beckoning her on, “but now is not the time to

discuss elf rights. I want to get back to the tent as

fast as we can. What happened to the others?”

“We lost them in the dark,” said Ron. “Dad, why was

everyone so uptight about that skull thing?”

“I’ll explain everything back at the tent,” said Mr.

Weasley tensely.

But when they reached the edge of the wood, their

progress was impeded. A large crowd of frightened-

looking witches and wizards was congregated there,

and when they saw Mr. Weasley coming toward them,

many of them surged forward.

“What’s going on in there?”

“Who conjured it?”

 

“Arthur — it’s not — Him?”

“Of course it’s not Him,” said Mr. Weasley

impatiently. “We don’t know who it was; it looks like

they Disapparated. Now excuse me, please, I want to

get to bed.”

He led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd

and back into the campsite. All was quiet now; there

was no sign of the masked wizards, though several

ruined tents were still smoking.

Charlie’s head was poking out of the boys’ tent.

“Dad, what’s going on?” he called through the dark.

“Fred, George, and Ginny got back okay, but the

others — ”

“I’ve got them here,” said Mr. Weasley, bending down

and entering the tent. Harry, Ron, and Hermione

entered after him.

Bill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a

bedsheet to his arm, which was bleeding profusely.

Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was

sporting a bloody nose. Fred, George, and Ginny

looked unhurt, though shaken.

“Did you get them, Dad?” said Bill sharply. “The

person who conjured the Mark?”

“No,” said Mr. Weasley. “We found Barty Crouch’s elf

holding Harry’s wand, but we’re none the wiser about

who actually conjured the Mark.”

“What?” said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together.

“Harry’s wand?” said Fred.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Mr. Crouch’s elf?” said Percy, sounding

thunderstruck.

With some assistance from Harry, Ron, and

Hermione, Mr. Weasley explained what had happened

in the woods. When they had finished their story,

Percy swelled indignantly.

“Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like

that!” he said. “Running away when he’d expressly

told her not to ... embarrassing him in front of the

whole Ministry . . . how would that have looked, if

she’d been brought up in front of the Department for

the Regulation and Control — ”

“She didn’t do anything — she was just in the wrong

place at the wrong time!” Hermione snapped at Percy,

who looked very taken aback. Hermione had always

got on fairly well with Percy — better, indeed, than

any of the others.

“Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch’s position can’t

afford a house-elf who’s going to run amok with a

wand!” said Percy pompously, recovering himself.

“She didn’t run amok!” shouted Hermione. “She just

picked it up off the ground!”

“Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing

was?” said Ron impatiently. “It wasn’t hurting

anyone. ... Why’s it such a big deal?”

“I told you, it’s You-Know-Who’s symbol, Ron,” said

Hermione, before anyone else could answer. “I read

about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.”

“And it hasn’t been seen for thirteen years,” said Mr.

Weasley quietly. “Of course people panicked ... it was

almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again.”

 

“I don’t get it,” said Ron, frowning. “I mean ... it’s still

only a shape in the sky. ...”

“Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark

Mark into the air whenever they killed,” said Mr.

Weasley. “The terror it inspired ... you have no idea,

you’re too young. Just picture coming home and

finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and

knowing what you’re about to find inside. ...” Mr.

Weasley winced. “Everyone’s worst fear ... the very

worst ...”

There was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing

the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said,

“Well, it didn’t help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It

scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw

it. They all Disapparated before we’d got near enough

to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses

before they hit the ground, though. They’re having

their memories modified right now.”

“Death Eaters?” said Harry. “What are Death Eaters?”

“It’s what You-Know- Who’s supporters called

themselves,” said Bill. “I think we saw what’s left of

them tonight — the ones who managed to keep

themselves out of Azkaban, anyway.”

“We can’t prove it was them, Bill,” said Mr. Weasley.

“Though it probably was,” he added hopelessly.

“Yeah, I bet it was!” said Ron suddenly. “Dad, we met

Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us

his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all

know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!”

“But what were Voldemort’s supporters — ” Harry

began. Everybody flinched — like most of the

wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying

 

Voldemort’s name. “Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “What

were You -Know- Who’s supporters up to, levitating

Muggles? I mean, what was the point?”

“The point?” said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh.

“Harry, that’s their idea of fun. Half the Muggle

killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were

done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight

and couldn’t resist reminding us all that lots of them

are still at large. A nice little reunion for them,” he

finished disgustedly.

“But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they

Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark?” said

Ron. “They’d have been pleased to see it, wouldn’t

they?”

“Use your brains, Ron,” said Bill. “If they really were

Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of

Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all

sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture

people. I bet they’d be even more frightened than the

rest of us to see him come back. They denied they’d

ever been involved with him when he lost his powers,

and went back to their daily lives. ... I don’t reckon

he’d be over-pleased with them, do you?”

“So ... whoever conjured the Dark Mark ...” said

Hermione slowly, “were they doing it to show support

for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?”

“Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione,” said Mr.

Weasley. “But I’ll tell you this ... it was only the Death

Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I’d be very

surprised if the person who did it hadn’t been a Death

Eater once, even if they’re not now. ... Listen, it’s very

late, and if your mother hears what’s happened she’ll

be worried sick. We’ll get a few more hours sleep and

then try and get an early Portkey out of here.”

 

Harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing.

He knew he ought to feel exhausted: It was nearly

three in the morning, but he felt wide-awake — wide-

awake, and worried.

Three days ago — it felt like much longer, but it had

only been three days — he had awoken with his scar

burning. And tonight, for the first time in thirteen

years, Lord Voldemort’s mark had appeared in the

sky. What did these things mean?

He thought of the letter he had written to Sirius

before leaving Privet Drive. Would Sirius have gotten

it yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up at

the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now

to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after

Charlie’s snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed

off.

MAYHEM AT THE MINISTRY

Mr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep.

He used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the

campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts

at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange,

dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a

vague “Merry Christmas.”

“Hell be all right,” said Mr. Weasley quietly as they

marched off onto the moor. “Sometimes, when a

person’s memory’s modified, it makes him a bit

disorientated for a while . . . and that was a big thing

they had to make him forget.”

They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot

where the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it,

they found a great number of witches and wizards

gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all

clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as

possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with

Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an

old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun

had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St.

 

Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow

in the dawn light, talking very little because they were

so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their

breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the

Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.

“Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!”

Mrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for

them in the front yard, came running toward them,

still wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale and

strained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily Prophet

clutched in her hand.

“Arthur — I’ve been so worried — so worried — ”

She flung her arms around Mr. Weasley’s neck, and

the Daily Prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the

ground. Looking down, Harry saw the headline:

SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD

CUP, complete with a twinkling black-and-white

photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops.

“You’re all right,” Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly,

releasing Mr. Weasley and staring around at them all

with red eyes, “you’re alive. ... Oh boys ...”

And to everybody’s surprise, she seized Fred and

George and pulled them both into such a tight hug

that their heads banged together.

“ Ouch\ Mum — you’re strangling us — ”

“I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs. Weasley said,

starting to sob. “It’s all I’ve been thinking about! What

if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I

ever said to you was that you didn’t get enough

O.W.L.s? Oh Fred ... George ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Come on, now, Molly, we’re all perfectly okay,” said

Mr. Weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and

leading her back toward the house. “Bill,” he added in

an undertone, “pick up that paper, I want to see what

it says. ...”

When they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen,

and Hermione had made Mrs. Weasley a cup of very

strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted on

pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhiskey, Bill

handed his father the newspaper. Mr. Weasley

scanned the front page while Percy looked over his

shoulder.

“I knew it,” said Mr. Weasley heavily. “Ministry

blunders ... culprits not apprehended ... lax security ...

Dark wizards running unchecked . . . national disgrace

... Who wrote this? Ah ... of course ... Rita Skeeter.”

“That woman’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic!”

said Percy furiously. “Last week she was saying we’re

wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness,

when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it

wasn’t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the

Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-

Humans — ”

“Do us a favor, Perce,” said Bill, yawning, “and shut

up.”

“I’m mentioned,” said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening

behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the

Daily Prophet article.

“Where?” spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea

and whiskey. “If I’d seen that, I’d have known you

were alive!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Not by name,” said Mr. Weasley. “Listen to this: ‘If

the terrified wizards and witches who waited

breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected

reassurance from the Ministry of Magic, they were

sadly disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some

time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging

that nobody had been hurt, but refusing to give any

more information. Whether this statement will be

enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were

removed from the woods an hour later, remains to be

seen.’ Oh really,” said Mr. Weasley in exasperation,

handing the paper to Percy. “Nobody was hurt. What

was I supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies

were removed from the woods ... well, there certainly

will be rumors now she’s printed that.”

He heaved a deep sigh. “Molly, I’m going to have to go

into the office; this is going to take some smoothing

over.”

“I’ll come with you, Father,” said Percy importantly.

“Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck. And I can

give him my cauldron report in person.”

He bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked

most upset.

“Arthur, you’re supposed to be on holiday! This hasn’t

got anything to do with your office; surely they can

handle this without you?”

“I’ve got to go, Molly,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’ve made

things worse. I’ll just change into my robes and I’ll be

off. ...”

“Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry suddenly, unable to

contain himself, “Hedwig hasn’t arrived with a letter

for me, has she?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Hedwig, dear?” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. “No ...

no, there hasn’t been any post at all.”

Ron and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a

meaningful look at both of them he said, “All right if I

go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?”

“Yeah ... think I will too,” said Ron at once.

“Hermione?”

“Yes,” she said quickly, and the three of them

marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs.

“What’s up, Harry?” said Ron, the moment they had

closed the door of the attic room behind them.

“There’s something I haven’t told you,” Harry said.

“On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar

hurting again.”

Ron’s and Hermione’s reactions were almost exactly

as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on

Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making

suggestions at once, mentioning a number of

reference books, and everybody from Albus

Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse.

Ron simply looked dumbstruck.

“But — he wasn’t there, was he? You-Know-Who? I

mean — last time your scar kept hurting, he was at

Hogwarts, wasn’t he?”

“I’m sure he wasn’t on Privet Drive,” said Harry. “But I

was dreaming about him . . . him and Peter — you

know, Wormtail. I can’t remember all of it now, but

they were plotting to kill ... someone.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

He had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying

“me,” but couldn’t bring himself to make Hermione

look any more horrified than she already did.

“It was only a dream,” said Ron bracingly. “Just a

nightmare.”

“Yeah, but was it, though?” said Harry, turning to

look out of the window at the brightening sky. “It’s

weird, isn’t it? ... My scar hurts, and three days later

the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort’s

sign’s up in the sky again.”

“Don’t — say — his — name!” Ron hissed through

gritted teeth.

“And remember what Professor Trelawney said?”

Harry went on, ignoring Ron. “At the end of last

year?”

Professor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at

Hogwarts. Hermione ’s terrified look vanished as she

let out a derisive snort.

“Oh Harry, you aren’t going to pay attention to

anything that old fraud says?”

“You weren’t there,” said Harry. “You didn’t hear her.

This time was different. I told you, she went into a

trance — a real one. And she said the Dark Lord

would rise again . . . greater and more terrible than ever

before ... and he’d manage it because his servant was

going to go back to him ... and that night Wormtail

escaped.”

There was a silence in which Ron fidgeted

absentmindedly with a hole in his Chudley Cannons

bedspread.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?”

Hermione asked. “Are you expecting a letter?”

“I told Sirius about my scar,” said Harry, shrugging.

“I’m waiting for his answer.”

“Good thinking!” said Ron, his expression clearing. “I

bet Sirius ’ll know what to do!”

“I hoped he’d get back to me quickly,” said Harry.

“But we don’t know where Sirius is ... he could be in

Africa or somewhere, couldn’t he?” said Hermione

reasonably. “Hedwig’s not going to manage that

journey in a few days.”

“Yeah, I know,” said Harry, but there was a leaden

feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window

at the Hedwig-free sky.

“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard,

Harry,” said Ron. “Come on — three on three, Bill and

Charlie and Fred and George will play. ... You can try

out the Wronski Feint. ...”

“Ron,” said Hermione, in an I-don’t-think-you’re-

being- very- sensitive sort of voice, “Harry doesn’t want

to play Quidditch right now. ... He’s worried, and he’s

tired. ... We all need to go to bed. ...”

“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry

suddenly. “Hang on, I’ll get my Firebolt.”

Hermione left the room, muttering something that

sounded very much like “Boys.”

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much

over the following week. Both left the house each

morning before the rest of the family got up, and

returned well after dinner every night.

“It’s been an absolute uproar,” Percy told them

importantly the Sunday evening before they were due

to return to Hogwarts. “I’ve been putting out fires all

week. People keep sending Howlers, and of course, if

you don’t open a Howler straight away, it explodes.

Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill

reduced to cinders.”

“Why are they all sending Howlers?” asked Ginny,

who was mending her copy of One Thousand Magical

Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in front of

the living room fire.

“Complaining about security at the World Cup,” said

Percy. “They want compensation for their ruined

property. Mundungus Fletcher’s put in a claim for a

twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi, but I’ve

got his number. I know for a fact he was sleeping

under a cloak propped on sticks.”

Mrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the

corner. Harry liked this clock. It was completely

useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise

very informative. It had nine golden hands, and each

of them was engraved with one of the Weasley family’s

names. There were no numerals around the face, but

descriptions of where each family member might be.

“Home,” “school,” and “work” were there, but there

was also “traveling,” “lost,” “hospital,” “prison,” and,

in the position where the number twelve would be on

a normal clock, “mortal peril.”

Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the

“home” position, but Mr. Weasley’s, which was the

 

longest, was still pointing to “work.” Mrs. Weasley

sighed.

“Your father hasn’t had to go into the office on

weekends since the days of You-Know-Who,” she said.

“They’re working him far too hard. His dinner’s going

to be mined if he doesn’t come home soon.”

“Well, Father feels he’s got to make up for his mistake

at the match, doesn’t he?” said Percy. “If truth be

told, he was a tad unwise to make a public statement

without clearing it with his Head of Department first

“Don’t you dare blame your father for what that

wretched Skeeter woman wrote!” said Mrs. Weasley,

flaring up at once.

“If Dad hadn’t said anything, old Rita would just have

said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry

had commented,” said Bill, who was playing chess

with Ron. “Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look

good. Remember, she interviewed all the Gringotts’

Charm Breakers once, and called me ‘a long-haired

pillock’?”

“Well, it is a bit long, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley gently.

“If you’d just let me — ”

“No, Mum.”

Rain lashed against the living room window.

Hermione was immersed in The Standard Book of

Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had

bought for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley.

Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava. Harry was

polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit

Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday

open at his feet. Fred and George were sitting in a far

 

corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads

bent over a piece of parchment.

“What are you two up to?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply,

her eyes on the twins.

“Homework,” said Fred vaguely.

“Don’t be ridiculous, you’re still on holiday,” said Mrs.

Weasley.

“Yeah, we’ve left it a bit late,” said George.

“You’re not by any chance writing out a new order

form, are you?” said Mrs. Weasley shrewdly. “You

wouldn’t be thinking of restarting Weasleys’ Wizard

Wheezes, by any chance?”

“Now, Mum,” said Fred, looking up at her, a pained

look on his face. “If the Hogwarts Express crashed

tomorrow, and George and I died, how would you feel

to know that the last thing we ever heard from you

was an unfounded accusation?”

Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Weasley.

“Oh your father’s coming!” she said suddenly, looking

up at the clock again.

Mr. Weasley’s hand had suddenly spun from “work”

to “traveling”; a second later it had shuddered to a

halt on “home” with the others, and they heard him

calling from the kitchen.

“Coming, Arthur!” called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying out

of the room.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

A few moments later, Mr. Weasley came into the

warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray. He

looked completely exhausted.

“Well, the fat’s really in the fire now,” he told Mrs.

Weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the

hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his

somewhat shriveled cauliflower. “Rita Skeeter’s been

ferreting around all week, looking for more Ministry

mess-ups to report. And now she’s found out about

poor old Bertha going missing, so that’ll be the

headline in the Prophet tomorrow. I told Bagman he

should have sent someone to look for her ages ago.”

“Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks,”

said Percy swiftly.

“Crouch is very lucky Rita hasn’t found out about

Winky,” said Mr. Weasley irritably. “There’d be a

week’s worth of headlines in his house-elf being

caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark

Mark.”

“I thought we were all agreed that that elf, while

irresponsible, did not conjure the Mark?” said Percy

hotly.

“If you ask me, Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the

Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves!” said

Hermione angrily.

“Now look here, Hermione!” said Percy. “A high-

ranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves

unswerving obedience from his servants — ”

“His slave, you mean!” said Hermione, her voice rising

passionately, “because he didn’t pay Winky, did he?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I think you’d all better go upstairs and check that

you’ve packed properly!” said Mrs. Weasley, breaking

up the argument. “Come on now, all of you. ...”

Harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his

Firebolt over his shoulder, and went back upstairs

with Ron. The rain sounded even louder at the top of

the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and

moans from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls

from the ghoul who lived in the attic. Pigwidgeon

began twittering and zooming around his cage when

they entered. The sight of the half-packed trunks

seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement.

“Bung him some Owl Treats,” said Ron, throwing a

packet across to Harry. “It might shut him up.”

Harry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of

Pigwidgeon’s cage, then turned to his trunk. Hedwig’s

cage stood next to it, still empty.

“It’s been over a week,” Harry said, looking at

Hedwig’s deserted perch. “Ron, you don’t reckon

Sirius has been caught, do you?”

“Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet,” said Ron.

“The Ministry would want to show they’d caught

someone, wouldn’t they?”

“Yeah, I suppose. ...”

“Look, here’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon

Alley. And she’s got some gold out of your vault for

you ... and she’s washed all your socks.”

He heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry’s camp bed

and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next

to it. Harry started unwrapping the shopping. Apart

from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by

 

Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a

dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-

making kit — he had been running low on spine of

lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling

underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud

noise of disgust behind him.

“What is that supposed to be?”

He was holding up something that looked to Harry

like a long, maroon velvet dress. It had a moldy-

looking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs.

There was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley

entered, carrying an armful of freshly laundered

Hogwarts robes.

“Here you are,” she said, sorting them into two piles.

“Now, mind you pack them properly so they don’t

crease.”

“Mum, you’ve given me Ginny’s new dress,” said Ron,

handing it out to her.

“Of course I haven’t,” said Mrs. Weasley. “That’s for

you. Dress robes.”

“What?” said Ron, looking horror-struck.

“Dress robes!” repeated Mrs. Weasley. “It says on your

school list that you’re supposed to have dress robes

this year ... robes for formal occasions.”

“You’ve got to be kidding,” said Ron in disbelief. “I’m

not wearing that, no way.”

“Everyone wears them, Ron!” said Mrs. Weasley

crossly. “They’re all like that! Your father’s got some

for smart parties!”

 

“I’ll go starkers before I put that on,” said Ron

stubbornly.

“Don’t be so silly,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’ve got to

have dress robes, they’re on your list! I got some for

Harry too ... show him, Harry. ...”

In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on

his camp bed. It wasn’t as bad as he had expected,

however; his dress robes didn’t have any lace on them

at all — in fact, they were more or less the same as

his school ones, except that they were bottle green

instead of black.

“I thought they’d bring out the color of your eyes,

dear,” said Mrs. Weasley fondly.

“Well, they’re okay!” said Ron angrily, looking at

Harry’s robes. “Why couldn’t I have some like that?”

“Because ... well, I had to get yours secondhand, and

there wasn’t a lot of choice!” said Mrs. Weasley,

flushing.

Harry looked away. He would willingly have split all

the money in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys,

but he knew they would never take it.

“I’m never wearing them,” Ron was saying stubbornly.

“Never.”

“Fine,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “Go naked. And, Harry,

make sure you get a picture of him. Goodness knows

I could do with a laugh.”

She left the room, slamming the door behind her.

There was a funny spluttering noise from behind

them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl

Treat.

 

“Why is everything I own rubbish?” said Ron

furiously, striding across the room to unstick

Pigwidgeon’s beak.

ABOARD THE HOGWARTS EXPRESS

There was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the

air when Harry awoke next morning. Heavy rain was

still splattering against the window as he got dressed

in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into

their school robes on the Hogwarts Express.

He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-

floor landing on their way down to breakfast, when

Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs,

looking harassed.

“Arthur!” she called up the staircase. “Arthur! Urgent

message from the Ministry!”

Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr.

Weasley came clattering past with his robes on back-

to-front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the

others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley

rummaging anxiously in the drawers — “I’ve got a

quill here somewhere!” — and Mr. Weasley bending

over the fire, talking to —

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to

make sure that they were working properly.

Amos Diggory’s head was sitting in the middle of the

flames like a large, bearded egg. It was talking very

fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying

around it and the flames licking its ears.

"... Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so

they went and called those what-d’you-call-’ems —

please-men. Arthur, you’ve got to get over there — ”

“Here!” said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a

piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled

quill into Mr. Weasley’s hands.

“ — it’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it,” said Mr.

Diggory’s head. “I had to come into the office early to

send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use

of Magic lot all setting off — if Rita Skeeter gets hold

of this one, Arthur — ”

“What does Mad-Eye say happened?” asked Mr.

Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his

quill, and preparing to take notes.

Mr. Diggory’s head rolled its eyes. “Says he heard an

intruder in his yard. Says he was creeping toward the

house, but was ambushed by his dustbins.”

“What did the dustbins do?” asked Mr. Weasley,

scribbling frantically.

“Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish

everywhere, as far as I can tell,” said Mr. Diggory.

“Apparently one of them was still rocketing around

when the please-men turned up — ”

Mr. Weasley groaned.

 

“And what about the intruder?”

“Arthur, you know Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Diggory’s head,

rolling its eyes again. “Someone creeping into his yard

in the dead of night? More likely there’s a very shell-

shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in

potato peelings. But if the Improper Use of Magic lot

get their hands on Mad-Eye, he’s had it — think of

his record — we’ve got to get him off on a minor

charge, something in your department — what are

exploding dustbins worth?”

“Might be a caution,” said Mr. Weasley, still writing

very fast, his brow furrowed. “Mad-Eye didn’t use his

wand? He didn’t actually attack anyone?”

“I’ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing

everything he could reach through the window,” said

Mr. Diggory, “but they’ll have a job proving it, there

aren’t any casualties.”

“All right, I’m off,” Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed

the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket

and dashed out of the kitchen again.

Mr. Diggory’s head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.

“Sorry about this, Molly,” it said, more calmly,

“bothering you so early and everything . . . but Arthur’s

the only one who can get Mad-Eye off, and Mad-Eye’s

supposed to be starting his new job today. Why he

had to choose last night ...”

“Never mind, Amos,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sure you

won’t have a bit of toast or anything before you go?”

“Oh go on, then,” said Mr. Diggory.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Mrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a

stack on the kitchen table, put it into the fire tongs,

and transferred it into Mr. Diggory’s mouth.

“Fanks,” he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a

small pop, vanished.

Harry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good-

byes to Bill, Charlie, Percy, and the girls. Within five

minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes on the

right way now, dragging a comb through his hair.

“I’d better hurry — you have a good term, boys,” said

Mr. Weasley to Harry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a

cloak over his shoulders and preparing to

Disapparate. “Molly, are you going to be all right

taking the kids to King’s Cross?”

“Of course I will,” she said. “You just look after Mad-

Eye, we’ll be fine.”

As Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the

kitchen.

“Did someone say Mad-Eye?” Bill asked. “What’s he

been up to now?

“He says someone tried to break into his house last

night,” said Mrs. Weasley.

“Mad-Eye Moody?” said George thoughtfully,

spreading marmalade on his toast. “Isn’t he that

nutter — ”

“Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,”

said Mrs. Weasley sternly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn’t he?” said Fred

quietly as Mrs. Weasley left the room. “Birds of a

feather ...”

“Moody was a great wizard in his time,” said Bill.

“He’s an old friend of Dumbledore’s, isn’t he?” said

Charlie.

“Dumbledore’s not what you’d call normal, though, is

he?” said Fred. “I mean, I know he’s a genius and

everything ...”

“Who is Mad-Eye?” asked Harry.

“He’s retired, used to work at the Ministry,” said

Charlie. “I met him once when Dad took me into work

with him. He was an Auror — one of the best ... a

Dark wizard catcher,” he added, seeing Harry’s blank

look. “Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of

him. He made himself loads of enemies, though ... the

families of people he caught, mainly . . . and I heard

he’s been getting really paranoid in his old age.

Doesn’t trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark wizards

everywhere.”

Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off

at King’s Cross station, but Percy, apologizing most

profusely, said that he really needed to get to work.

“I just can’t justify taking more time off at the

moment,” he told them. “Mr. Crouch is really starting

to rely on me.”

“Yeah, you know what, Percy?” said George seriously.

“I reckon he’ll know your name soon.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Mrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village

post office to order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take

them into London.

“Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,” Mrs.

Weasley whispered to Harry as they stood in the rain-

washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six

heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars. “But there

weren’t any to spare. ... Oh dear, they don’t look

happy, do they?”

Harry didn’t like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi

drivers rarely transported overexcited owls, and

Pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket. Nor

did it help that a number of Filibuster’s Fabulous

Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks went off unexpectedly

when Fred’s trunk sprang open, causing the driver

carrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks

clawed his way up the man’s leg.

The journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that

they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their

trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover

from the fireworks, and by the time they entered

London, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all severely

scratched. They were very relieved to get out at King’s

Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder

than ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks

across the busy road and into the station.

Harry was used to getting onto platform nine and

three-quarters by now. It was a simple matter of

walking straight through the apparently solid barrier

dividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part

was doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid

attracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups

today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most

conspicuous, since they were accompanied by

Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned

 

casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly,

and slid sideways through it ... and as they did so,

platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front

of them.

The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam

engine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing

from it, through which the many Hogwarts students

and parents on the platform appeared like dark

ghosts. Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in

response to the hooting of many owls through the

mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats,

and were soon stowing their luggage in a

compartment halfway along the train. They then

hopped back down onto the platform to say good-bye

to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.

“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,”

said Charlie, grinning, as he hugged Ginny good-bye.

“Why?” said Fred keenly.

“You’ll see,” said Charlie. “Just don’t tell Percy I

mentioned it ... it’s ‘classified information, until such

time as the Ministry sees fit to release it,’ after all.”

“Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this

year,” said Bill, hands in his pockets, looking almost

wistfully at the train.

“Why?” said George impatiently.

“You’re going to have an interesting year,” said Bill,

his eyes twinkling. “I might even get time off to come

and watch a bit of it. ...”

“A bit of what?” said Ron.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

But at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs.

Weasley chivvied them toward the train doors.

“Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,” said

Hermione as they climbed on board, closed the door,

and leaned out of the window to talk to her.

“Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,” said

Harry.

“Oh it was my pleasure, dears,” said Mrs. Weasley.

“Td invite you for Christmas, but ... well, I expect

you’re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what

with ... one thing and another.”

“Mum!” said Ron irritably. “What d’you three know

that we don’t?”

“You’ll find out this evening, I expect,” said Mrs.

Weasley, smiling. “It’s going to be very exciting —

mind you, I’m very glad they’ve changed the rules — ”

“What rules?” said Harry, Ron, Fred, and George

together.

“I’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. ... Now,

behave, won’t you? Won’t you, Fred? And you,

George?”

The pistons hissed loudly and the train began to

move.

“Tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts!” Fred

bellowed out of the window as Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and

Charlie sped away from them. “What rules are they

changing?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

But Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the

train had rounded the corner, she, Bill, and Charlie

had Disapparated.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their

compartment. The thick rain splattering the windows

made it very difficult to see out of them. Ron undid

his trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and

flung them over Pigwidgeon’s cage to muffle his

hooting.

“Bagman wanted to tell us what’s happening at

Hogwarts,” he said grumpily, sitting down next to

Harry. “At the World Cup, remember? But my own

mother won’t say. Wonder what — ”

“Shh!” Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her

finger to her lips and pointing toward the

compartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron listened,

and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in

through the open door.

"... Father actually considered sending me to

Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He

knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his

opinion of Dumbledore — the man’s such a

Mudblood-lover — and Durmstrang doesn’t admit

that sort of riffraff. But Mother didn’t like the idea of

me going to school so far away. Father says

Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than

Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students

actually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we

do. ...”

Hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door,

and slid it shut, blocking out Malfoy’s voice.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him,

does he?” she said angrily. “I wish he had gone, then

we wouldn’t have to put up with him.”

“Durmstrang’s another wizarding school?” said Harry.

“Yes,” said Hermione sniffily, “and it’s got a horrible

reputation. According to An Appraisal of Magical

Education in Europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the

Dark Arts.”

“I think I’ve heard of it,” said Ron vaguely. “Where is

it? What country?”

“Well, nobody knows, do they?” said Hermione,

raising her eyebrows.

“Er — why not?” said Harry.

“There’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all

the magic schools. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like

to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal

their secrets,” said Hermione matter-of-factly.

“Come off it,” said Ron, starting to laugh.

“Durmstrang’s got to be about the same size as

Hogwarts — how are you going to hide a great big

castle?”

“But Hogwarts is hidden,” said Hermione, in surprise.

“Everyone knows that ... well, everyone who’s read

Hogwarts, A History, anyway.”

“Just you, then,” said Ron. “So go on — how d’you

hide a place like Hogwarts?”

“It’s bewitched,” said Hermione. “If a Muggle looks at

it, all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT ENTER,

UNSAFE.”

“So Durmstrangll just look like a min to an outsider

too?”

“Maybe,” said Hermione, shrugging, “or it might have

Muggle-repelling charms on it, like the World Cup

stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it,

they’ll have made it Unplottable — ”

“Come again?”

“Well, you can enchant a building so it’s impossible to

plot on a map, can’t you?”

“Er ... if you say so,” said Harry.

“But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the

far north,” said Hermione thoughtfully. “Somewhere

very cold, because they’ve got fur capes as part of

their uniforms.”

“Ah, think of the possibilities,” said Ron dreamily. “It

would’ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and

make it look like an accident. ... Shame his mother

likes him. ...”

The rain became heavier and heavier as the train

moved farther north. The sky was so dark and the

windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by

midday. The lunch trolley came rattling along the

corridor, and Harry bought a large stack of Cauldron

Cakes for them to share.

Several of their friends looked in on them as the

afternoon progressed, including Seamus Finnigan,

Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a round-

faced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought

 

up by his formidable witch of a grandmother. Seamus

was still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its

magic seemed to be wearing off now; it was still

squeaking “ Troy — Mullet — Moran\” but in a very

feeble and exhausted sort of way. After half an hour

or so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless

Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The

Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying

to learn a Summoning Charm.

Neville listened jealously to the others’ conversation

as they relived the Cup match.

“Gran didn’t want to go,” he said miserably. “Wouldn’t

buy tickets. It sounded amazing though.”

“It was,” said Ron. “Look at this, Neville. ...”

He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and

pulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.

“Oh wow,” said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum

onto his pudgy hand.

“We saw him right up close, as well,” said Ron. “We

were in the Top Box — ”

“For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.”

Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind

him stood Crabbe and Goyle, his enormous, thuggish

cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at

least a foot during the summer. Evidently they had

overheard the conversation through the compartment

door, which Dean and Seamus had left ajar.

“Don’t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,” said

Harry coolly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Weasley ... what is that?” said Malfoy, pointing at

Pigwidgeon’s cage. A sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was

dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train,

the moldy lace cuff very obvious.

Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy

was too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and

pulled.

“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up

Ron’s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley,

you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you? I

mean — they were very fashionable in about eighteen

ninety. ...”

“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the

dress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy’s

grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe

and Goyle guffawed stupidly.

“So ... going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring

a bit of glory to the family name? There’s money

involved as well, you know ... you’d be able to afford

some decent robes if you won. ...”

“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.

“ Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated. “I suppose

you will, Potter? You never miss a chance to show off,

do you?”

“Either explain what you’re on about or go away,

Malfoy,” said Hermione testily, over the top of The

Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.

A gleeful smile spread across Malfoy’s pale face.

“Don’t tell me you don’t know?” he said delightedly.

“You’ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and

 

you don’t even know ? My God, my father told me

about it ages ago ... heard it from Cornelius Fudge.

But then, Father’s always associated with the top

people at the Ministry. . . . Maybe your father’s too

junior to know about it, Weasley ... yes ... they

probably don’t talk about important stuff in front of

him. ...”

Laughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and

Goyle, and the three of them disappeared.

Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding

compartment door so hard behind them that the glass

shattered.

“Ronl” said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled

out her wand, muttered “ ReparoV ’ and the glass

shards flew back into a single pane and back into the

door.

“Well ... making it look like he knows everything and

we don’t. ...” Ron snarled. “ ‘Father’s always

associated with the top people at the Ministry.’... Dad

could’ve got a promotion any time ... he just likes it

where he is. ...”

“Of course he does,” said Hermione quietly. “Don’t let

Malfoy get to you, Ron — ”

“Him! Get to me!? As if!” said Ron, picking up one of

the remaining Cauldron Cakes and squashing it into

a pulp.

Ron’s bad mood continued for the rest of the journey.

He didn’t talk much as they changed into their school

robes, and was still glowering when the Hogwarts

Express slowed down at last and finally stopped in

the pitch-darkness of Hogsmeade station.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

As the train doors opened, there was a rumble of

thunder overhead. Hermione bundled up

Crookshanks in her cloak and Ron left his dress

robes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads

bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour. The

rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it

was as though buckets of ice-cold water were being

emptied repeatedly over their heads.

“Hi, Hagrid!” Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette

at the far end of the platform.

“All righ’, Harry?” Hagrid bellowed back, waving. “See

yeh at the feast if we don’ drown!”

First years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by

sailing across the lake with Hagrid.

“Oooh, I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this

weather,” said Hermione fervently, shivering as they

inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of

the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood

waiting for them outside the station. Harry, Ron,

Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into one of

them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments

later, with a great lurch, the long procession of

carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the

track toward Hogwarts Castle.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT

Through the gates, flanked with statues of winged

boars, and up the sweeping drive the carriages

trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast

becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry

could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted

windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick

curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as

their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front

doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps.

People who had occupied the carriages in front were

already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle.

Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from

their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up

only when they were safely inside the cavernous,

torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble

staircase.

“Blimey,” said Ron, shaking his head and sending

water everywhere, “if that keeps up the lake’s going to

overflow. I’m soak — ARRGH!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from

out of the ceiling onto Ron’s head and exploded.

Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways

into Harry, just as a second water bomb dropped —

narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry’s feet,

sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into

his socks. People all around them shrieked and

started pushing one another in their efforts to get out

of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating

twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little

man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his

wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as

he took aim again.

“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down

here at ONCE!”

Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress and

head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of

the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and

grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself

from falling.

“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger — ”

“That’s all right, Professor!” Hermione gasped,

massaging her throat.

“Peeves, get down here NOW!” barked Professor

McGonagall, straightening her pointed hat and

glaring upward through her square-rimmed

spectacles.

“Not doing nothing!” cackled Peeves, lobbing a water

bomb at several fifth-year girls, who screamed and

dived into the Great Hall. “Already wet, aren’t they?

Little squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!” And he aimed another

bomb at a group of second years who had just

arrived.

 

“I shall call the headmaster!” shouted Professor

McGonagall. “I’m warning you, Peeves — ”

Peeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his

water bombs into the air, and zoomed off up the

marble staircase, cackling insanely.

“Well, move along, then!” said Professor McGonagall

sharply to the bedraggled crowd. “Into the Great Hall,

come on!”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the

entrance hall and through the double doors on the

right, Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he

pushed his sopping hair off his face.

The Great Hall looked its usual splendid self,

decorated for the start-of-term feast. Golden plates

and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and

hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in

midair. The four long House tables were packed with

chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff

sat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils.

It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron, and

Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the

Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with

the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall,

next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost.

Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed

tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly

large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking

extra-festive, and insuring that his head didn’t wobble

too much on his partially severed neck.

“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them.

“Says who?” said Harry, taking off his sneakers and

emptying them of water. “Hope they hurry up with the

Sorting. I’m starving.”

 

The Sorting of the new students into Houses took

place at the start of every school year, but by an

unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t

been present at one since his own. He was quite

looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited,

breathless voice called down the table.

“Hiya, Harry!”

It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was

something of a hero.

“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.

“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s

starting! My brother Dennis!”

“Er — good,” said Harry.

“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing

up and down in his seat. “I just hope he’s in

Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”

“Er — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to

Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers

and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t

they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all

seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.

“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati

Patil’s twin’s in Ravenclaw, and they’re identical.

You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t you?”

Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be

rather more empty seats there than usual. Hagrid, of

course, was still fighting his way across the lake with

the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably

supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

there was another empty chair too, and Harry

couldn’t think who else was missing.

“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts

teacher?” said Hermione, who was also looking up at

the teachers.

They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark

Arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms.

Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor Lupin, who

had resigned last year. He looked up and down the

staff table. There was definitely no new face there.

“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione,

looking anxious.

Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little

Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on

a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the

Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her

flyaway gray hair. She was talking to Professor

Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor

Sinistra ’s other side was the sallow-faced, hook-

nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, Snape —

Harry’s least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry’s

loathing of Snape was matched only by Snape ’s

hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible,

intensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius

escape right under Snape ’s overlarge nose — Snape

and Sirius had been enemies since their own school

days.

On Snape ’s other side was an empty seat, which

Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall’s. Next to it,

and in the very center of the table, sat Professor

Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair

and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent

deep green robes embroidered with many stars and

moons. The tips of Dumbledore ’s long, thin fingers

 

were together and he was resting his chin upon them,

staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon

spectacles as though lost in thought. Harry glanced

up at the ceiling too. It was enchanted to look like the

sky outside, and he had never seen it look this

stormy. Black and purple clouds were swirling across

it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a

fork of lightning flashed across it.

“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, beside Harry, “I could

eat a hippogriff.”

The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the

doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell.

Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first

years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and

Hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first

years looked. They appeared to have swum across the

lake rather than sailed. All of them were shivering

with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed

along the staff table and came to a halt in a line

facing the rest of the school — all of them except the

smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was

wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid’s

moleskin overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it

looked as though he were draped in a furry black

circus tent. His small face protruded from over the

collar, looking almost painfully excited. When he had

lined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught

Colin Creevey’s eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and

mouthed, I fell in the lake\ He looked positively

delighted about it.

Professor McGonagall now placed a three-legged stool

on the ground before the first years and, on top of it,

an extremely old, dirty, patched wizard’s hat. The first

years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a

moment, there was silence. Then a long tear near the

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke

into song:

A thousand years or more ago,

When I was newly sewn,

There lived four wizards of renown,

Whose names are still well known:

Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,

Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,

Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,

Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.

They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,

They hatched a daring plan

To educate young sorcerers

Thus Hogwarts School began.

Now each of these four founders

Formed their own house, for each

Did value different virtues

In the ones they had to teach.

By Gryffindor, the bravest were

Prized far beyond the rest;

For Ravenclaw, the cleverest

Would always be the best;

For Hufflepuff, hard workers were

Most worthy of admission;

And power-hungry Slytherin

Loved those of great ambition.

While still alive they did divide

Their favorites from the throng,

Yet how to pick the worthy ones

When they were dead and gone?

Twas Gryffindor who found the way,

He whipped me off his head

The founders put some brains in me

So I could choose instead!

Now slip me snug about your ears,

I’ve never yet been wrong,

111 have a look inside your mind

And tell where you belong!

 

The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat

finished.

“That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,” said

Harry, clapping along with everyone else.

“Sings a different one every year,” said Ron. “It’s got

to be a pretty boring life, hasn’t it, being a hat? I

suppose it spends all year making up the next one.”

Professor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll

of parchment.

“When I call out your name, you will put on the hat

and sit on the stool,” she told the first years. “When

the hat announces your House, you will go and sit at

the appropriate table.

“Ackerley, Stewart!”

A boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to

foot, picked up the Sorting Hat, put it on, and sat

down on the stool.

“RAVENCLAW!” shouted the hat.

Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a

seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was

applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the

Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he

sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange

desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.

“Baddock, Malcolm!”

“SLYTHERIN!”

The table on the other side of the hall erupted with

cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock

 

joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether

Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out

more Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred

and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.

“Branstone, Eleanor!”

“HUFFLEPUFF!”

“Cauldwell, Owen!”

“HUFFLEPUFF!”

“Creevey, Dennis!”

Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over

Hagrid ’s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into

the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table.

About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least

three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild,

tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming

— a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and

Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature.

He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the

staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on

the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide —

“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted.

Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis

Creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it

back on the stool, and hurried over to join his

brother.

“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into

an empty seat. “It was brilliant! And something in the

water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly. “It was probably

the giant squid, Dennis!”

“Wow\” said Dennis, as though nobody in their

wildest dreams could hope for more than being

thrown into a storm-tossed, fathoms-deep lake, and

pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.

“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one

with the black hair and glasses? See him? Know who

he is, Dennis ?”

Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting

Hat, now Sorting Emma Dobbs.

The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying

degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to

the three-legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as

Professor McGonagall passed the L’s.

“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.

“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than

food,” said Nearly Headless Nick as “Madley, Laura!”

became a Hufflepuff.

“ ’Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.

“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to

scratch,” said Nearly Headless Nick, applauding as

“McDonald, Natalie!” joined the Gryffindor table. “We

don’t want to break our winning streak, do we?”

Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship

for the last three years in a row.

“Pritchard, Graham!”

“SLYTHERIN!”

 

“Quirke, Orla!”

“RAVENCLAW!”

And finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!” (“HUFFLEPUFF!”),

the Sorting ended. Professor McGonagall picked up

the hat and the stool and carried them away.

“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and

looking expectantly at his golden plate.

Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was

smiling around at the students, his arms opened wide

in welcome.

“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them,

his deep voice echoing around the Hall. “ Tuck in.”

“Hear, hear!” said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty

dishes filled magically before their eyes.

Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry,

Ron, and Hermione loaded their own plates.

“Aaah, ’at’s be’er,” said Ron, with his mouth full of

mashed potato.

“You’re lucky there’s a feast at all tonight, you know,”

said Nearly Headless Nick. “There was trouble in the

kitchens earlier.”

“Why? Wha’ ’appened?” said Harry, through a sizable

chunk of steak.

“Peeves, of course,” said Nearly Headless Nick,

shaking his head, which wobbled dangerously. He

pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck. “The

usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the

feast — well, it’s quite out of the question, you know

 

what he’s like, utterly uncivilized, can’t see a plate of

food without throwing it. We held a ghost’s council —

the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but

most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his

foot down.”

The Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt

and silent specter covered in silver bloodstains. He

was the only person at Hogwarts who could really

control Peeves.

“Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about

something,” said Ron darkly. “So what did he do in

the kitchens?”

“Oh the usual,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging.

“Wreaked havoc and mayhem. Pots and pans

everywhere. Place swimming in soup. Terrified the

house-elves out of their wits — ”

Clang.

Hermione had knocked over her golden goblet.

Pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth,

staining several feet of white linen orange, but

Hermione paid no attention.

“There are house-elves here?” she said, staring,

horror-struck, at Nearly Headless Nick. “Here at

Hogwarts ?”

“Certainly,” said Nearly Headless Nick, looking

surprised at her reaction. “The largest number in any

dwelling in Britain, I believe. Over a hundred.”

“I’ve never seen one!” said Hermione.

“Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do

they?” said Nearly Headless Nick. “They come out at

 

night to do a bit of cleaning . . . see to the fires and so

on. ... I mean, you’re not supposed to see them, are

you? That’s the mark of a good house-elf, isn’t it, that

you don’t know it’s there?”

Hermione stared at him.

“But they get paid?” she said. “They get holidays,

don’t they? And — and sick leave, and pensions, and

everything?”

Nearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff

slipped and his head flopped off, dangling on the inch

or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it

to his neck.

“Sick leave and pensions?” he said, pushing his head

back onto his shoulders and securing it once more

with his ruff. “House-elves don’t want sick leave and

pensions!”

Hermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of

food, then put her knife and fork down upon it and

pushed it away from her.

“Oh c’mon, ’Er-my-knee,” said Ron, accidentally

spraying Harry with bits of Yorkshire pudding. “Oops

— sorry, ’Arry — ” He swallowed. “You won’t get them

sick leave by starving yourself!”

“Slave labor,” said Hermione, breathing hard through

her nose. “That’s what made this dinner. Slave labor.”

And she refused to eat another bite.

The rain was still drumming heavily against the high,

dark glass. Another clap of thunder shook the

windows, and the stormy ceiling flashed, illuminating

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

the golden plates as the remains of the first course

vanished and were replaced, instantly, with puddings.

“Treacle tart, Hermione!” said Ron, deliberately

wafting its smell toward her. “Spotted dick, look!

Chocolate gateau!”

But Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of

Professor McGonagall that he gave up.

When the puddings too had been demolished, and the

last crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving them

sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to his feet

again. The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased

almost at once, so that only the howling wind and

pounding rain could be heard.

“So!” said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all.

“Now that we are all fed and watered,” (“Hmph!” said

Hermione) “I must once more ask for your attention,

while I give out a few notices.

“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you

that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has

this year been extended to include Screaming Yo-yos,

Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The

full list comprises some four hundred and thirty-

seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr.

Filch ’s office, if anybody would like to check it.”

The corners of Dumbledore ’s mouth twitched. He

continued, “As ever, I would like to remind you all

that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to

students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below

third year.

“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the

Inter-House Quidditch Cup will not take place this

year.”

 

“What?” Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and

George, his fellow members of the Quidditch team.

They were mouthing soundlessly at Dumbledore,

apparently too appalled to speak. Dumbledore went

on, “This is due to an event that will be starting in

October, and continuing throughout the school year,

taking up much of the teachers’ time and energy —

but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have

great pleasure in announcing that this year at

Hogwarts — ”

But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of

thunder and the doors of the Great Hall banged open.

A man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long

staff, shrouded in a black traveling cloak. Every head

in the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger,

suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning

that flashed across the ceiling. He lowered his hood,

shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray hair,

then began to walk up toward the teachers’ table.

A dull clunk echoed through the Hall on his every

other step. He reached the end of the top table,

turned right, and limped heavily toward Dumbledore.

Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling.

Hermione gasped.

The lightning had thrown the man’s face into sharp

relief, and it was a face unlike any Harry had ever

seen. It looked as though it had been carved out of

weathered wood by someone who had only the

vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to

look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel.

Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth

looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the

nose was missing. But it was the man’s eyes that

made him frightening.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

One of them was small, dark, and beady. The other

was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue.

The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without

blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to

side, quite independently of the normal eye — and

then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the

man’s head, so that all they could see was whiteness.

The stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a

hand that was as badly scarred as his face, and

Dumbledore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn’t

hear. He seemed to be making some inquiry of the

stranger, who shook his head unsmilingly and replied

in an undertone. Dumbledore nodded and gestured

the man to the empty seat on his right-hand side.

The stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray

hair out of his face, pulled a plate of sausages toward

him, raised it to what was left of his nose, and sniffed

it. He then took a small knife out of his pocket,

speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat.

His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the

blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its

socket, taking in the Hall and the students.

“May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark

Arts teacher?” said Dumbledore brightly into the

silence. “Professor Moody.”

It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with

applause, but none of the staff or students clapped

except Dumbledore and Hagrid, who both put their

hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed

dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly

quickly. Everyone else seemed too transfixed by

Moody’s bizarre appearance to do more than stare at

him.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Moody?” Harry muttered to Ron. “MacL-Eye Moody?

The one your dad went to help this morning?”

“Must be,” said Ron in a low, awed voice.

“What happened to him?” Hermione whispered. “What

happened to his face?”

“Dunno,” Ron whispered back, watching Moody with

fascination.

Moody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-

warm welcome. Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in

front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak,

pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from

it. As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a

few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the

table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a

clawed foot.

Dumbledore cleared his throat.

“As I was saying,” he said, smiling at the sea of

students before him, all of whom were still gazing

transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, “we are to have the

honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming

months, an event that has not been held for over a

century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you

that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at

Hogwarts this year.”

“You’re JOKING!” said Fred Weasley loudly.

The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody’s

arrival suddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and

Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.

“I am not joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now

that you mention it, I did hear an excellent one over

 

the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun

who all go into a bar ...”

Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.

“Er — but maybe this is not the time ... no ...” said

Dumbledore, “where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard

Tournament ... well, some of you will not know what

this tournament involves, so I hope those who do

know will forgive me for giving a short explanation,

and allow their attention to wander freely.

“The Triwizard Tournament was first established

some seven hundred years ago as a friendly

competition between the three largest European

schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and

Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent

each school, and the three champions competed in

three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to

host the tournament once every five years, and it was

generally agreed to be a most excellent way of

establishing ties between young witches and wizards

of different nationalities — until, that is, the death toll

mounted so high that the tournament was

discontinued.”

“ Death toll?” Hermione whispered, looking alarmed.

But her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the

majority of students in the Hall; many of them were

whispering excitedly to one another, and Harry

himself was far more interested in hearing about the

tournament than in worrying about deaths that had

happened hundreds of years ago.

“There have been several attempts over the centuries

to reinstate the tournament,” Dumbledore continued,

“none of which has been very successful. However,

our own departments of International Magical

Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have

 

decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have

worked hard over the summer to ensure that this

time, no champion will find himself or herself in

mortal danger.

“The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be

arriving with their short-listed contenders in October,

and the selection of the three champions will take

place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide

which students are most worthy to compete for the

Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a

thousand Galleons personal prize money.”

“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table,

his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such

glory and riches. He was not the only person who

seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts

champion. At every House table, Harry could see

people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else

whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then

Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once

more.

“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the

Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,” he said, “the heads of the

participating schools, along with the Ministry of

Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on

contenders this year. Only students who are of age —

that is to say, seventeen years or older — will be

allowed to put forward their names for consideration.

This” — Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for

several people had made noises of outrage at these

words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking

furious — “is a measure we feel is necessary, given

that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and

dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is

highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh

year will be able to cope with them. I will personally

be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our

 

impartial judge into making them Hogwarts

champion.” His light blue eyes twinkled as they

flickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I

therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting

yourself if you are under seventeen.

“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang

will be arriving in October and remaining with us for

the greater part of this year. I know that you will all

extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they

are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support

to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected.

And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to

you all to be alert and rested as you enter your

lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!”

Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to

Mad-Eye Moody. There was a great scraping and

banging as all the students got to their feet and

swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance

hall.

“They can’t do that!” said George Weasley, who had

not joined the crowd moving toward the door, but was

standing up and glaring at Dumbledore. “We’re

seventeen in April, why can’t we have a shot?”

“They’re not stopping me entering,” said Fred

stubbornly, also scowling at the top table. “The

champions’ll get to do all sorts of stuff you’d never be

allowed to do normally. And a thousand Galleons

prize money!”

“Yeah,” said Ron, a faraway look on his face. “Yeah, a

thousand Galleons ...”

“Come on,” said Hermione, “we’ll be the only ones left

here if you don’t move.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for

the entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways

in which Dumbledore might stop those who were

under seventeen from entering the tournament.

“Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who

the champions are?” said Harry.

“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I

reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it,

George. ...”

“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said

Ron.

“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the

champion is, is he?” said Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to

me like once this judge knows who wants to enter,

he’ll choose the best from each school and never mind

how old they are. Dumbledore ’s trying to stop us

giving our names.”

“People have died, though!” said Hermione in a

worried voice as they walked through a door

concealed behind a tapestry and started up another,

narrower staircase.

“Yeah,” said Fred airily, “but that was years ago,

wasn’t it? Anyway, where’s the fun without a bit of

risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get ’round

Dumbledore? Fancy entering?”

“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked Harry. “Be cool to

enter, wouldn’t it? But I s’pose they might want

someone older. ... Dunno if we’ve learned enough. ...”

“I definitely haven’t,” came Neville’s gloomy voice from

behind Fred and George.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I expect my gran’d want me to try, though. She’s

always going on about how I should be upholding the

family honor. I’ll just have to — oops. ...”

Neville’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway

up the staircase. There were many of these trick

stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of

the older students to jump this particular step, but

Neville’s memory was notoriously poor. Harry and

Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him

out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs

creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.

“Shut it, you,” said Ron, banging down its visor as

they passed.

They made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor

Tower, which was concealed behind a large portrait of

a fat lady in a pink silk dress.

“Password?” she said as they approached.

“Balderdash,” said George, “a prefect downstairs told

me.”

The portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall

through which they all climbed. A crackling fire

warmed the circular common room, which was full of

squashy armchairs and tables. Hermione cast the

merrily dancing flames a dark look, and Harry

distinctly heard her mutter “ Slave labor,” before

bidding them good night and disappearing through

the doorway to the girls’ dormitory.

Harry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral

staircase until they reached their own dormitory,

which was situated at the top of the tower. Five four-

poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against

the walls, each with its owner’s trunk at the foot.

 

Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed;

Seamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his

headboard, and Dean had tacked up a poster of

Viktor Krum over his bedside table. His old poster of

the West Ham football team was pinned right next to

it.

“Mental,” Ron sighed, shaking his head at the

completely stationary soccer players.

Harry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and

into bed. Someone — a house-elf, no doubt — had

placed warming pans between the sheets. It was

extremely comfortable, lying there in bed and

listening to the storm raging outside.

“I might go in for it, you know,” Ron said sleepily

through the darkness, “if Fred and George find out

how to ... the tournament ... you never know, do

you?”

“S’pose not. ...”

Harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new

pictures forming in his mind’s eye. ... He had

hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was

seventeen ... he had become Hogwarts champion ...

he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in

triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were

applauding and screaming ... he had just won the

Triwizard Tournament. ... Cho’s face stood out

particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face

glowing with admiration. ...

Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that

Ron couldn’t see what he could.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

MAD-EYE MOODY

The storm had blown itself out by the following

morning, though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still

gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead

as Harry, Ron, and Hermione examined their new

course schedules at breakfast. A few seats along,

Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing

magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing

their way into the Triwizard Tournament.

“Today’s not bad ... outside all morning,” said Ron,

who was running his finger down the Monday column

of his schedule. “Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and

Care of Magical Creatures ... damn it, we’re still with

the Slytherins. ...”

“Double Divination this afternoon,” Harry groaned,

looking down. Divination was his least favorite

subject, apart from Potions. Professor Trelawney kept

predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely

annoying.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You should have given it up like me, shouldn’t you?”

said Hermione briskly, buttering herself some toast.

“Then you’d be doing something sensible like

Arithmancy.”

“You’re eating again, I notice,” said Ron, watching

Hermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast

too.

“I’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand

about elf rights,” said Hermione haughtily.

“Yeah ... and you were hungry,” said Ron, grinning.

There was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a

hundred owls came soaring through the open

windows carrying the morning mail. Instinctively,

Harry looked up, but there was no sign of white

among the mass of brown and gray. The owls circled

the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters

and packages were addressed. A large tawny owl

soared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a

parcel into his lap — Neville almost always forgot to

pack something. On the other side of the Hall Draco

Malfoy’s eagle owl had landed on his shoulder,

carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets

and cakes from home. Trying to ignore the sinking

feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry

returned to his porridge. Was it possible that

something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius

hadn’t even got his letter?

His preoccupation lasted all the way across the

sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in

greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by

Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants

Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like

plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding

vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly

 

and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it,

which appeared to be full of liquid.

“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly.

“They need squeezing. You will collect the pus — ”

“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding

revolted.

“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout, “and it’s

extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect

the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon-

hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when

undiluted, bubotuber pus.”

Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly

satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large

amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth,

which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the

bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the

end of the lesson had collected several pints.

“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor

Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork. “An

excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne,

bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to

desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.”

“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a

Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice. “She tried to curse hers

off.”

“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head.

“But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the

end.”

A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet

grounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the

class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone

 

steps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading

in the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward

Hagrid ’s small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge

of the Forbidden Forest.

Hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the

collar of his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There

were several open wooden crates on the ground at his

feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his

collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents

more closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling

noise reached their ears, punctuated by what

sounded like minor explosions.

“Mornin’!” Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and

Hermione. “Be’er wait fer the Slytherins, they won’

want ter miss this — Blast-Ended Skrewts!”

“Come again?” said Ron.

Hagrid pointed down into the crates.

“Eurgh!” squealed Lavender Brown, jumping

backward.

“Eurgh” just about summed up the Blast-Ended

Skrewts in Harry’s opinion. They looked like

deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy -

looking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and

no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them

in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling

over one another, bumping blindly into the sides of

the boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell

of rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly

out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it

would be propelled forward several inches.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“On’y jus’ hatched,” said Hagrid proudly, “so yeh’ll be

able ter raise ’em yerselves! Thought we’d make a bit

of a project of it!”

“And why would we want to raise them?” said a cold

voice.

The Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco

Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle were chuckling

appreciatively at his words.

Hagrid looked stumped at the question.

“I mean, what do they do?” asked Malfoy. “What is the

point of them?”

Hagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard;

there was a few seconds’ pause, then he said roughly,

“Tha’s next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus’ feedin’ ’em today.

Now, yeh’ll wan’ ter try ’em on a few diff’rent things —

I’ve never had ’em before, not sure what they’ll go fer

— I got ant eggs an’ frog livers an’ a bit o’ grass snake

— just try ’em out with a bit of each.”

“First pus and now this,” muttered Seamus.

Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have

made Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy

handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates

to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn’t

suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was

entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to

have mouths.

“Ouch\” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes.

“It got me!”

Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid

a burn on his hand.

“Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,” said

Hagrid, nodding.

“Eurgh!” said Lavender Brown again. “Eurgh, Hagrid,

what’s that pointy thing on it?”

“Ah, some of ’em have got stings,” said Hagrid

enthusiastically (Lavender quickly withdrew her hand

from the box). “I reckon they’re the males. ... The

females Ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies. ... I

think they might be ter suck blood.”

“Well, I can certainly see why we’re trying to keep

them alive,” said Malfoy sarcastically. “Who wouldn’t

want pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at once?”

“Just because they’re not very pretty, it doesn’t mean

they’re not useful,” Hermione snapped. “Dragon

blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a

dragon for a pet, would you?”

Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a

furtive smile from behind his bushy beard. Hagrid

would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as

Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew only too well — he

had owned one for a brief period during their first

year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of

Norbert. Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures,

the more lethal, the better.

“Well, at least the skrewts are small,” said Ron as

they made their way back up to the castle for lunch

an hour later.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“They are now,” said Hermione in an exasperated

voice, “but once Hagrid’s found out what they eat, I

expect they’ll be six feet long.”

“Well, that won’t matter if they turn out to cure

seasickness or something, will it?” said Ron, grinning

slyly at her.

“You know perfectly well I only said that to shut

Malfoy up,” said Hermione. “As a matter of fact I

think he’s right. The best thing to do would be to

stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking

us all.”

They sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped

themselves to lamb chops and potatoes. Hermione

began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her.

“Er — is this the new stand on elf rights?” said Ron.

“You’re going to make yourself puke instead?”

“No,” said Hermione, with as much dignity as she

could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts. “I

just want to get to the library.”

“What?” said Ron in disbelief. “Hermione — it’s the

first day back! We haven’t even got homework yet!”

Hermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her

food as though she had not eaten for days. Then she

leapt to her feet, said, “See you at dinner!” and

departed at high speed.

When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon

lessons, Harry and Ron set off for North Tower where,

at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver

stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling,

and the room where Professor Trelawney lived.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

The familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire

met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the

stepladder. As ever, the curtains were all closed; the

circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast

by the many lamps, which were all draped with

scarves and shawls. Harry and Ron walked through

the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that

cluttered the room, and sat down at the same small

circular table.

“Good day,” said the misty voice of Professor

Trelawney right behind Harry, making him jump.

A very thin woman with enormous glasses that made

her eyes appear far too large for her face, Professor

Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the tragic

expression she always wore whenever she saw him.

The usual large amount of beads, chains, and bangles

glittered upon her person in the firelight.

“You are preoccupied, my dear,” she said mournfully

to Harry. “My inner eye sees past your brave face to

the troubled soul within. And I regret to say that your

worries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead

for you, alas ... most difficult ... I fear the thing you

dread will indeed come to pass ... and perhaps sooner

than you think. ...”

Her voice dropped almost to a whisper. Ron rolled his

eyes at Harry, who looked stonily back. Professor

Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a

large winged armchair before the fire, facing the class.

Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, who deeply

admired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on poufs

very close to her.

“My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,” she

said. “The movements of the planets and the

mysterious portents they reveal only to those who

 

understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human

destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays,

which intermingle ...”

But Harry’s thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire

always made him feel sleepy and dull-witted, and

Professor Trelawney’s rambling talks on fortune-

telling never held him exactly spellbound — though

he couldn’t help thinking about what she had just

said to him. “ ‘I fear the thing you dread will indeed

come to pass . . . ’ ”

But Hermione was right, Harry thought irritably,

Professor Trelawney really was an old fraud. He

wasn’t dreading anything at the moment at all ... well,

unless you counted his fears that Sirius had been

caught ... but what did Professor Trelawney know? He

had long since come to the conclusion that her brand

of fortune-telling was really no more than lucky

guesswork and a spooky manner.

Except, of course, for that time at the end of last

term, when she had made the prediction about

Voldemort rising again . . . and Dumbledore himself

had said that he thought that trance had been

genuine, when Harry had described it to him. ...

“Harry\” Ron muttered.

“What?”

Harry looked around; the whole class was staring at

him. He sat up straight; he had been almost dozing

off, lost in the heat and his thoughts.

“I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born

under the baleful influence of Saturn,” said Professor

Trelawney, a faint note of resentment in her voice at

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on

her words.

“Born under — what, sorry?” said Harry.

“Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!” said Professor

Trelawney, sounding definitely irritated that he wasn’t

riveted by this news. “I was saying that Saturn was

surely in a position of power in the heavens at the

moment of your birth. ... Your dark hair ... your mean

stature ... tragic losses so young in life ... I think I am

right in saying, my dear, that you were born in

midwinter?”

“No,” said Harry, “I was born in July.”

Ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.

Half an hour later, each of them had been given a

complicated circular chart, and was attempting to fill

in the position of the planets at their moment of birth.

It was dull work, requiring much consultation of

timetables and calculation of angles.

“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said Harry after a while,

frowning down at his piece of parchment, “that can’t

be right, can it?”

“Aaaaah,” said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney’s

mystical whisper, “when two Neptunes appear in the

sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being

born, Harry ...”

Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby,

sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask

the excited squeals from Lavender Brown — “Oh

Professor, look! I think I’ve got an unaspected planet!

Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“It is Uranus, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney,

peering down at the chart.

“Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?” said

Ron.

Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him,

and it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so

much homework at the end of the class.

“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary

movements in the coming month will affect you, with

reference to your personal chart,” she snapped,

sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than

her usual airy-fairy self. “I want it ready to hand in

next Monday, and no excuses!”

“Miserable old bat,” said Ron bitterly as they joined

the crowds descending the staircases back to the

Great Hall and dinner. “Thatll take all weekend, that

will. ...”

“Lots of homework?” said Hermione brightly, catching

up with them. “Professor Vector didn’t give us any at

all!”

“Well, bully for Professor Vector,” said Ron moodily.

They reached the entrance hall, which was packed

with people queuing for dinner. They had just joined

the end of the line, when a loud voice rang out behind

them.

“Weasley! Hey, Weasley!”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned. Malfoy, Crabbe,

and Goyle were standing there, each looking

thoroughly pleased about something.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“What?” said Ron shortly.

“Your dad’s in the paper, Weasley!” said Malfoy,

brandishing a copy of the Daily Prophet and speaking

very loudly, so that everyone in the packed entrance

hall could hear. “Listen to this!

FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC

It seems as though the Ministry of Magic’s troubles are

not yet at an end, writes Rita Skeeter, Special

Correspondent. Recently under fire for its poor crowd

control at the Quidditch World Cup, and still unable to

account for the disappearance of one of its witches, the

Ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment

yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley, of the

Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. ”

Malfoy looked up.

“Imagine them not even getting his name right,

Weasley. It’s almost as though he’s a complete

nonentity, isn’t it?” he crowed.

Everyone in the entrance hall was listening now.

Malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and

read on:

Arnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of

a flying car two years ago, was yesterday involved in

a tussle with several Muggle law-keepers (“policemen”)

over a number of highly aggressive dustbins. Mr.

Weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of “Mad-

Eye” Moody, the aged ex-Auror who retired from the

Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference

between a handshake and attempted murder.

Unsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley found, upon arrival at Mr.

Moody ’s heavily guarded house, that Mr. Moody had

once again raised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley was

 

forced to modify several memories before he could

escape from the policemen, but refused to answer

Daily Prophet questions about why he had involved

the Ministry in such an undignified and potentially

embarrassing scene.

“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Malfoy, flipping

the paper over and holding it up. “A picture of your

parents outside their house — if you can call it a

house! Your mother could do with losing a bit of

weight, couldn’t she?”

Ron was shaking with fury. Everyone was staring at

him.

“Get stuffed, Malfoy,” said Harry. “C’mon, Ron. ...”

“Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer,

weren’t you, Potter?” sneered Malfoy. “So tell me, is

his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?”

“You know your mother, Malfoy?” said Harry — both

he and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron’s

robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy —

“that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under

her nose? Has she always looked like that, or was it

just because you were with her?”

Malfoy’s pale face went slightly pink.

“Don’t you dare insult my mother, Potter.”

“Keep your fat mouth shut, then,” said Harry, turning

away.

BANG!

Several people screamed — Harry felt something

white-hot graze the side of his face — he plunged his

 

hand into his robes for his wand, but before he’d even

touched it, he heard a second loud BANG, and a roar

that echoed through the entrance hall.

“OH NO YOU DONT, LADDIE!”

Harry spun around. Professor Moody was limping

down the marble staircase. His wand was out and it

was pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was

shivering on the stone-flagged floor, exactly where

Malfoy had been standing.

There was a terrified silence in the entrance hall.

Nobody but Moody was moving a muscle. Moody

turned to look at Harry — at least, his normal eye was

looking at Harry; the other one was pointing into the

back of his head.

“Did he get you?” Moody growled. His voice was low

and gravelly.

“No,” said Harry, “missed.”

“LEAVE IT!” Moody shouted.

“Leave — what?” Harry said, bewildered.

“Not you — him!” Moody growled, jerking his thumb

over his shoulder at Crabbe, who had just frozen,

about to pick up the white ferret. It seemed that

Moody’s rolling eye was magical and could see out of

the back of his head.

Moody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the

ferret, which gave a terrified squeak and took off,

streaking toward the dungeons.

“I don’t think so!” roared Moody, pointing his wand at

the ferret again — it flew ten feet into the air, fell with

 

a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once

more.

“I don’t like people who attack when their opponent’s

back’s turned,” growled Moody as the ferret bounced

higher and higher, squealing in pain. “Stinking,

cowardly, scummy thing to do. ...”

The ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing

helplessly.

“Never — do — that — again — ” said Moody, speaking

each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and

bounced upward again.

“Professor Moody!” said a shocked voice.

Professor McGonagall was coming down the marble

staircase with her arms full of books.

“Hello, Professor McGonagall,” said Moody calmly,

bouncing the ferret still higher.

“What — what are you doing?” said Professor

McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret’s

progress through the air.

“Teaching,” said Moody.

“Teach — Moody, is that a student?” shrieked

Professor McGonagall, the books spilling out of her

arms.

“Yep,” said Moody.

“No!” cried Professor McGonagall, running down the

stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with

a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared,

lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair

 

all over his now brilliantly pink face. He got to his

feet, wincing.

“Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a

punishment!” said Professor McGonagall weakly.

“Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?”

“He might’ve mentioned it, yeah,” said Moody,

scratching his chin unconcernedly, “but I thought a

good sharp shock — ”

“We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender’s

Head of House!”

“I’ll do that, then,” said Moody, staring at Malfoy with

great dislike.

Malfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain

and humiliation, looked malevolently up at Moody

and muttered something in which the words “my

father” were distinguishable.

“Oh yeah?” said Moody quietly, limping forward a few

steps, the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around

the hall. “Well, I know your father of old, boy. ... You

tell him Moody’s keeping a close eye on his son . . . you

tell him that from me. ... Now, your Head of House’ll

be Snape, will it?”

“Yes,” said Malfoy resentfully.

“Another old friend,” growled Moody. “I’ve been

looking forward to a chat with old Snape. ... Come on,

you. ...”

And he seized Malfoy’s upper arm and marched him

off toward the dungeons.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Professor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for

a few moments, then waved her wand at her fallen

books, causing them to soar up into the air and back

into her arms.

“Don’t talk to me,” Ron said quietly to Harry and

Hermione as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a

few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all

sides about what had just happened.

“Why not?” said Hermione in surprise.

“Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,”

said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression

on his face. “Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing

ferret ...”

Harry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione

began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.

“He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,” she said.

“It was good, really, that Professor McGonagall

stopped it — ”

“Hermione!” said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping

open again, “you’re ruining the best moment of my

life!”

Hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat

at top speed again.

“Don’t tell me you’re going back to the library this

evening?” said Harry, watching her.

“Got to,” said Hermione thickly. “Loads to do.”

“But you told us Professor Vector — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“It’s not schoolwork,” she said. Within five minutes,

she had cleared her plate and departed. No sooner

had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred

Weasley.

“Moody!” he said. “How cool is he?”

“Beyond cool,” said George, sitting down opposite

Fred.

“Supercool,” said the twins’ best friend, Lee Jordan,

sliding into the seat beside George. “We had him this

afternoon,” he told Harry and Ron.

“What was it like?” said Harry eagerly.

Fred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of

meaning.

“Never had a lesson like it,” said Fred.

“He knows, man,” said Lee.

“Knows what?” said Ron, leaning forward.

“Knows what it’s like to be out there doing it,” said

George impressively.

“Doing what?” said Harry.

“Fighting the Dark Arts,” said Fred.

“He’s seen it all,” said George.

“ ’Mazing,” said Lee.

Ron dived into his bag for his schedule.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“We haven’t got him till Thursday!” he said in a

disappointed voice.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES

The next two days passed without great incident,

unless you counted Neville melting his sixth cauldron

in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have

attained new levels of vindictiveness over the

summer, gave Neville detention, and Neville returned

from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been

made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.

“You know why Snape ’s in such a foul mood, don’t

you?” said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione

teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog

guts from under his fingernails.

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Moody.”

It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted

the Dark Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for

the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of

their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it —

but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt

animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry

saw the two of them together — at mealtimes, or

 

when they passed in the corridors — he had the

distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody’s

eye, whether magical or normal.

“I reckon Snape’s a bit scared of him, you know,”

Harry said thoughtfully.

“Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,”

said Ron, his eyes misting over, “and bounced him all

around his dungeon. ...”

The Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to

Moody’s first lesson so much that they arrived early

on Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his

classroom before the bell had even rung. The only

person missing was Hermione, who turned up just in

time for the lesson.

“Been in the — ”

“Library.” Harry finished her sentence for her.

“C’mon, quick, or we won’t get decent seats.”

They hurried into three chairs right in front of the

teacher’s desk, took out their copies of The Dark

Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection, and waited,

unusually quiet. Soon they heard Moody’s distinctive

clunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he

entered the room, looking as strange and frightening

as ever. They could just see his clawed, wooden foot

protruding from underneath his robes.

“You can put those away,” he growled, stumping over

to his desk and sitting down, “those books. You won’t

need them.”

They returned the books to their bags, Ron looking

excited.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Moody took out a register, shook his long mane of

grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face,

and began to call out names, his normal eye moving

steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled

around, fixing upon each student as he or she

answered.

“Right then,” he said, when the last person had

declared themselves present, “I’ve had a letter from

Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you’ve had a

pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures

— you’ve covered boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks,

grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that right?”

There was a general murmur of assent.

“But you’re behind — very behind — on dealing with

curses,” said Moody. “So I’m here to bring you up to

scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I’ve got

one year to teach you how to deal with Dark — ”

“What, aren’t you staying?” Ron blurted out.

Moody’s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron;

Ron looked extremely apprehensive, but after a

moment Moody smiled — the first time Harry had

seen him do so. The effect was to make his heavily

scarred face look more twisted and contorted than

ever, but it was nevertheless good to know that he

ever did anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked

deeply relieved.

“You’ll be Arthur Weasley’s son, eh?” Moody said.

“Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few

days ago. ... Yeah, I’m staying just the one year.

Special favor to Dumbledore. ... One year, and then

back to my quiet retirement.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

He gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled

hands together.

“So — straight into it. Curses. They come in many

strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry

of Magic, I’m supposed to teach you countercurses

and leave it at that. I’m not supposed to show you

what illegal Dark curses look like until you’re in the

sixth year. You’re not supposed to be old enough to

deal with it till then. But Professor Dumbledore’s got

a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can

cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you’re up

against, the better. How are you supposed to defend

yourself against something you’ve never seen? A

wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t

going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going

to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be

prepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You

need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m

talking.”

Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing

Parvati her completed horoscope under the desk.

Apparently Moody’s magical eye could see through

solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.

“So ... do any of you know which curses are most

heavily punished by wizarding law?”

Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including

Ron’s and Hermione’s. Moody pointed at Ron, though

his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.

“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one.

... Is it called the Imperius Curse, or something?”

“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father

would know that one. Gave the Ministry a lot of

trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”

 

Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his

desk drawer, and took out a glass jar. Three large

black spiders were scuttling around inside it. Harry

felt Ron recoil slightly next to him — Ron hated

spiders.

Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders,

and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could

all see it. He then pointed his wand at it and

muttered, “Imperio\”

The spider leapt from Moody’s hand on a fine thread

of silk and began to swing backward and forward as

though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs rigidly,

then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing

on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles.

Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two

of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably

a tap dance.

Everyone was laughing — everyone except Moody.

“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it,

would you, if I did it to you?”

The laughter died away almost instantly.

“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider

balled itself up and began to roll over and over. “I

could make it jump out of the window, drown itself,

throw itself down one of your throats ...”

Ron gave an involuntary shudder.

“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards

being controlled by the Imperius Curse,” said Moody,

and Harry knew he was talking about the days in

which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

the Ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced

to act, and who was acting of their own free will.

“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be

teaching you how, but it takes real strength of

character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid

being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!”

he barked, and everyone jumped.

Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw

it back into the jar.

“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”

Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to

Harry’s slight surprise, did Neville’s. The only class in

which Neville usually volunteered information was

Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville

looked surprised at his own daring.

“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over

to fix on Neville.

“There’s one — the Cruciatus Curse,” said Neville in a

small but distinct voice.

Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time

with both eyes.

“Your name’s Longbottom?” he said, his magical eye

swooping down to check the register again.

Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further

inquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he

reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it

upon the desktop, where it remained motionless,

apparently too scared to move.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody. “Needs to be a bit

bigger for you to get the idea,” he said, pointing his

wand at the spider. “Engorgio\”

The spider swelled. It was now larger than a

tarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his

chair backward, as far away from Moody’s desk as

possible.

Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider,

and muttered, “CrucioV’

At once, the spider’s legs bent in upon its body; it

rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from

side to side. No sound came from it, but Harry was

sure that if it could have given voice, it would have

been screaming. Moody did not remove his wand, and

the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently

“Stop it!” Hermione said shrilly.

Harry looked around at her. She was looking, not at

the spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her

gaze, saw that Neville’s hands were clenched upon the

desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes

wide and horrified.

Moody raised his wand. The spider’s legs relaxed, but

it continued to twitch.

“Reducio,” Moody muttered, and the spider shrank

back to its proper size. He put it back into the jar.

“Pain,” said Moody softly. “You don’t need

thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can

perform the Cruciatus Curse. ... That one was very

popular once too.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Right . . . anyone know any others?”

Harry looked around. From the looks on everyone’s

faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was

going to happen to the last spider. Hermione’s hand

shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into

the air.

“Yes?” said Moody, looking at her.

“Avada Kedavra,” Hermione whispered.

Several people looked uneasily around at her,

including Ron.

“Ah,” said Moody, another slight smile twisting his

lopsided mouth. “Yes, the last and worst. Avada

Kedavra ... the Killing Curse.”

He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as

though it knew what was coming, the third spider

scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar,

trying to evade Moody’s fingers, but he trapped it, and

placed it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle

frantically across the wooden surface.

Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill

of foreboding.

“Avada Kedavral” Moody roared.

There was a flash of blinding green light and a

rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something

was soaring through the air — instantaneously the

spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but

unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled

cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost

toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.

 

Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the

floor.

“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s

no countercurse. There’s no blocking it. Only one

known person has ever survived it, and he’s sitting

right in front of me.”

Harry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of

them) looked into his own. He could feel everyone else

looking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank

blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really

seeing it at all. ...

So that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like

that spider. Had they been unblemished and

unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of

green light and heard the rush of speeding death,

before life was wiped from their bodies?

Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over

and over again for three years now, ever since he’d

found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d

found out what had happened that night: Wormtail

had betrayed his parents’ whereabouts to Voldemort,

who had come to find them at their cottage. How

Voldemort had killed Harry’s father first. How James

Potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at

his wife to take Harry and run ... Voldemort had

advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so

that he could kill Harry . . . how she had begged him to

kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son . . .

and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before

turning his wand on Harry. . . .

Harry knew these details because he had heard his

parents’ voices when he had fought the dementors

last year — for that was the terrible power of the

dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst

 

memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their

own despair. . . .

Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it

seemed to Harry. With a massive effort, he pulled

himself back to the present and listened to what

Moody was saying.

“Avada Kedavra’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of

magic behind it — you could all get your wands out

now and point them at me and say the words, and I

doubt I’d get so much as a nosebleed. But that

doesn’t matter. I’m not here to teach you how to do it.

“Now, if there’s no countercurse, why am I showing

you? Because you’ve got to know. You’ve got to

appreciate what the worst is. You don’t want to find

yourself in a situation where you’re facing it.

CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he roared, and the whole

class jumped again.

“Now ... those three curses — Avada Kedavra,

Imperius, and Cruciatus — are known as the

Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a

fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence

in Azkaban. That’s what you’re up against. That’s

what I’ve got to teach you to fight. You need

preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you

need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get

out your quills ... copy this down. ...”

They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each

of the Unforgivable Curses. No one spoke until the

bell rang — but when Moody had dismissed them and

they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst

forth. Most people were discussing the curses in awed

voices — “Did you see it twitch?” “ — and when he

killed it — just like that!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

They were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as

though it had been some sort of spectacular show,

but he hadn’t found it very entertaining — and nor, it

seemed, had Hermione.

“Hurry up,” she said tensely to Harry and Ron.

“Not the ruddy library again?” said Ron.

“No,” said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side

passage. “Neville.”

Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage,

staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same

horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody

had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.

“Neville?” Hermione said gently.

Neville looked around.

“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual.

“Interesting lesson, wasn’t it? I wonder what’s for

dinner, I’m — I’m starving, aren’t you?”

“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.

“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same

unnaturally high voice. “Very interesting dinner — I

mean lesson — what’s for eating?”

Ron gave Harry a startled look.

“Neville, what — ?”

But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and

they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward

them. All four of them fell silent, watching him

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much

lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.

“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville. “Why don’t

you come up to my office? Come on . . . we can have a

cup of tea. ...”

Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of

tea with Moody. He neither moved nor spoke. Moody

turned his magical eye upon Harry.

“You all right, are you, Potter?”

“Yes,” said Harry, almost defiantly.

Moody’s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it

surveyed Harry. Then he said, “You’ve got to know. It

seems harsh, maybe, but you’ve got to know. No point

pretending ... well ... come on, Longbottom, I’ve got

some books that might interest you.”

Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and

Hermione, but they didn’t say anything, so Neville

had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away,

one of Moody’s gnarled hands on his shoulder.

“What was that about?” said Ron, watching Neville

and Moody turn the corner.

“I don’t know,” said Hermione, looking pensive.

“Some lesson, though, eh?” said Ron to Harry as they

set off for the Great Hall. “Fred and George were right,

weren’t they? He really knows his stuff, Moody,

doesn’t he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that

spider just died, just snuffed it right — ”

But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry’s

face and didn’t speak again until they reached the

 

Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better

make a start on Professor Trelawney’s predictions

tonight, since they would take hours.

Hermione did not join in with Harry and Ron’s

conversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast,

and then left for the library again. Harry and Ron

walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had

been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now

raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.

“Wouldn’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with

the Ministry if they knew we’d seen the curses?”

Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady.

“Yeah, probably,” said Ron. “But Dumbledore’s always

done things his way, hasn’t he, and Moody’s been

getting in trouble for years, I reckon. Attacks first and

asks questions later — look at his dustbins.

Balderdash.”

The Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance

hole, and they climbed into the Gryffindor common

room, which was crowded and noisy.

“Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?” said Harry.

“I s’pose,” Ron groaned.

They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books

and charts, to find Neville there alone, sitting on his

bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at

the end of Moody’s lesson, though still not entirely

normal. His eyes were rather red.

“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.

“Oh yes,” said Neville, “I’m fine, thanks. Just reading

this book Professor Moody lent me. ...”

 

He held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the

Mediterranean.

“Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody

I’m really good at Herbology,” Neville said. There was

a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely

heard there before. “He thought I’d like this.”

Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry

thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering

Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was

good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor

Lupin would have done.

Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the

Future back down to the common room, found a

table, and set to work on their predictions for the

coming month. An hour later, they had made very

little progress, though their table was littered with

bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and

Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been

filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire.

“I haven’t got a clue what this lot’s supposed to

mean,” he said, staring down at a long list of

calculations.

“You know,” said Ron, whose hair was on end

because of all the times he had run his fingers

through it in frustration, “I think it’s back to the old

Divination standby.”

“What — make it up?”

“Yeah,” said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled

notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and

starting to write.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Next Monday,” he said as he scribbled, “I am likely to

develop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of

Mars and Jupiter.” He looked up at Harry. “You know

her — just put in loads of misery, shell lap it up.”

“Right,” said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt

and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering

first years into the fire. “Okay ... on Monday, / will be

in danger of — er — burns.”

“Yeah, you will be,” said Ron darkly, “we’re seeing the

skrewts again on Monday. Okay, Tuesday, I’ll ... erm

“Lose a treasured possession,” said Harry, who was

flicking through Unfogging the Future for ideas.

“Good one,” said Ron, copying it down. “Because of

... erm ... Mercury. Why don’t you get stabbed in the

back by someone you thought was a friend?”

“Yeah ... cool ...” said Harry, scribbling it down,

“because ... Venus is in the twelfth house.”

“And on Wednesday, I think I’ll come off worst in a

fight.”

“Aaah, I was going to have a fight. Okay, I’ll lose a

bet.”

“Yeah, you’ll be betting I’ll win my fight. ...”

They continued to make up predictions (which grew

steadily more tragic) for another hour, while the

common room around them slowly emptied as people

went up to bed. Crookshanks wandered over to them,

leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared

inscrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might look if

she knew they weren’t doing their homework properly.

 

Staring around the room, trying to think of a kind of

misfortune he hadn’t yet used, Harry saw Fred and

George sitting together against the opposite wall,

heads together, quills out, poring over a single piece

of parchment. It was most unusual to see Fred and

George hidden away in a corner and working silently;

they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the

noisy center of attention. There was something

secretive about the way they were working on the

piece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how

they had sat together writing something back at the

Burrow. He had thought then that it was another

order form for Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, but it didn’t

look like that this time; if it had been, they would

surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He

wondered whether it had anything to do with entering

the Triwizard Tournament.

As Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred,

scratched out something with his quill, and said, in a

very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the

almost deserted room, “No — that sounds like we’re

accusing him. Got to be careful ...”

Then George looked over and saw Harry watching

him. Harry grinned and quickly returned to his

predictions — he didn’t want George to think he was

eavesdropping. Shortly after that, the twins rolled up

their parchment, said good night, and went off to bed.

Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so

when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed

into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment

in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she

walked in the other. Crookshanks arched his back,

purring.

“Hello,” she said, “I’ve just finished!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“So have I!” said Ron triumphantly, throwing down

his quill.

Hermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying

in an empty armchair, and pulled Ron’s predictions

toward her.

“Not going to have a very good month, are you?” she

said sardonically as Crookshanks curled up in her

lap.

“Ah well, at least I’m forewarned,” Ron yawned.

“You seem to be drowning twice,” said Hermione.

“Oh am I?” said Ron, peering down at his predictions.

“I’d better change one of them to getting trampled by

a rampaging hippogriff.”

“Don’t you think it’s a bit obvious you’ve made these

up?” said Hermione.

“How dare you!” said Ron, in mock outrage. “We’ve

been working like house-elves here!”

Hermione raised her eyebrows.

“It’s just an expression,” said Ron hastily.

Harry laid down his quill too, having just finished

predicting his own death by decapitation.

“What’s in the box?” he asked, pointing at it.

“Funny you should ask,” said Hermione, with a nasty

look at Ron. She took off the lid and showed them the

contents.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Inside were about fifty badges, all of different colors,

but all bearing the same letters: S.P.E.W.

“ ‘Spew?” said Harry, picking up a badge and looking

at it. “What’s this about?”

“Not spew,” said Hermione impatiently. “It’s S-P-E-W.

Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish

Welfare.”

“Never heard of it,” said Ron.

“Well, of course you haven’t,” said Hermione briskly,

“I’ve only just started it.”

“Yeah?” said Ron in mild surprise. “How many

members have you got?”

“Well — if you two join — three,” said Hermione.

“And you think we want to walk around wearing

badges saying ‘spew,’ do you?” said Ron.

“S-P-E-W!” said Hermione hotly. “I was going to put

Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical

Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal

Status — but it wouldn’t fit. So that’s the heading of

our manifesto.”

She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them.

“I’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf

enslavement goes back centuries. I can’t believe no

one’s done anything about it before now.”

“Hermione — open your ears,” said Ron loudly. “They.

Like. It. They like being enslaved!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even

more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she

hadn’t heard a word, “are to secure house-elves fair

wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims

include changing the law about non-wand use, and

trying to get an elf into the Department for the

Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because

they’re shockingly underrepresented.”

“And how do we do all this?” Harry asked.

“We start by recruiting members,” said Hermione

happily. “I thought two Sickles to join — that buys a

badge — and the proceeds can fund our leaflet

campaign. You’re treasurer, Ron — I’ve got you a

collecting tin upstairs — and Harry, you’re secretary,

so you might want to write down everything I’m

saying now, as a record of our first meeting.”

There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the

pair of them, and Harry sat, torn between

exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look

on Ron’s face. The silence was broken, not by Ron,

who in any case looked as though he was temporarily

dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window.

Harry looked across the now empty common room

and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl

perched on the windowsill.

“Hedwig!” he shouted, and he launched himself out of

his chair and across the room to pull open the

window.

Hedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and

landed on the table on top of Harry’s predictions.

“About time!” said Harry, hurrying after her.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“She’s got an answer!” said Ron excitedly, pointing at

the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig’s leg.

Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read,

whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting

softly.

“What does it say?” Hermione asked breathlessly.

The letter was very short, and looked as though it had

been scrawled in a great hurry. Harry read it aloud:

Harry —

I’m flying north immediately. This news about your

scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that

have reached me here. If it hurts again , go straight to

Dumbledore — they’re saying he’s got Mad-Eye out of

retirement, which means he’s reading the signs, even if

no one else is.

I’ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione.

Keep your eyes open, Harry.

Sirius

Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared

back at him.

“He’s flying north?” Hermione whispered. “He’s

coming back?”

“Dumbledore’s reading what signs?” said Ron, looking

perplexed. “Harry — what’s up?”

For Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with

his fist, jolting Hedwig out of his lap.

“I shouldn’t’ve told him!” Harry said furiously.

 

“What are you on about?” said Ron in surprise.

“It’s made him think he’s got to come back!” said

Harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that

Hedwig landed on the back of Ron’s chair, hooting

indignantly. “Coming back, because he thinks I’m in

trouble! And there’s nothing wrong with me! And I

haven’t got anything for you,” Harry snapped at

Hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly,

“you’ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food.”

Hedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took

off for the open window, cuffing him around the head

with her outstretched wing as she went.

“Harry,” Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.

“I’m going to bed,” said Harry shortly. “See you in the

morning.”

Upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas

and got into his four-poster, but he didn’t feel

remotely tired.

If Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his,

Harry’s, fault. Why hadn’t he kept his mouth shut? A

few seconds’ pain and he’d had to blab. ... If he’d just

had the sense to keep it to himself. . . .

He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short

while later, but did not speak to him. For a long time,

Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed.

The dormitory was completely silent, and, had he

been less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that

the absence of Neville’s usual snores meant that he

was not the only one lying awake.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

BEAUXBATONS AND DRUMSTRANG

Early next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully

formed in his mind, as though his sleeping brain had

been working on it all night. He got up, dressed in the

pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking

Ron, and went back down to the deserted common

room. Here he took a piece of parchment from the

table upon which his Divination homework still lay

and wrote the following letter:

Dear Sirius,

I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half

asleep when I wrote to you last time. There’s no point

coming back, everything’s fine here. Don’t worry about

me, my head feels completely normal.

Harry

He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through

the silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who

tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

the fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the

Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower.

The Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold

and drafty, because none of the windows had glass in

them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl

droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and

voles. Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every

breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that

rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of

them asleep, though here and there a round amber

eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled

between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to

her, sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor.

It took him a while to persuade her to wake up and

then to look at him, as she kept shuffling around on

her perch, showing him her tail. She was evidently

still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous

night. In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might

be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to

borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg

and allow him to tie the letter to it.

“Just find him, all right?” Harry said, stroking her

back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes

in the wall. “Before the dementors do.”

She nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she

would ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a

reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread

her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry

watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of

unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure

that Sirius’s reply would alleviate his worries rather

than increasing them.

“That was a lie, Harry,” said Hermione sharply over

breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had

 

done. “You didn’t imagine your scar hurting and you

know it.”

“So what?” said Harry. “He’s not going back to

Azkaban because of me.”

“Drop it,” said Ron sharply to Hermione as she

opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once,

Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.

Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the

next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself

from looking anxiously around every morning when

the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went

to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions

of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark

London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his

mind off his godfather. He wished he still had

Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on

a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On

the other hand, their lessons were becoming more

difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly

Moody’s Defense Against the Dark Arts.

To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced

that he would be putting the Imperius Curse on each

of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see

whether they could resist its effects.

“But — but you said it’s illegal, Professor,” said

Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the

desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear

space in the middle of the room. “You said — to use it

against another human was — ”

“Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,”

said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto Hermione

and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. “If

you’d rather learn the hard way — when someone’s

 

putting it on you so they can control you completely

— fine by me. You’re excused. Off you go.”

He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door.

Hermione went very pink and muttered something

about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry

and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione

would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an

important lesson.

Moody began to beckon students forward in turn and

put the Imperius Curse upon them. Harry watched

as, one by one, his classmates did the most

extraordinary things under its influence. Dean

Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing

the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a

squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite

astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have

been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them

seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of

them recovered only when Moody had removed it.

“Potter,” Moody growled, “you next.”

Harry moved forward into the middle of the

classroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of

desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry,

and said, “Imperio\”

It was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating

sensation as every thought and worry in his head was

wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague,

untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling

immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone

watching him.

And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice, echoing in

some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto

the desk . . . jump onto the desk. . . .

 

Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.

Jump onto the desk. ...

Why, though? Another voice had awoken in the back

of his brain.

Stupid thing to do, really, said the voice.

Jump onto the desk. ...

No, I don’t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a

little more firmly ... no, I don’t really want to. ...

Jump\ NOW

The next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He

had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from

jumping — the result was that he’d smashed

headlong into the desk, knocking it over, and, by the

feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.

“Now, that’s more like it!” growled Moody’s voice, and

suddenly, Harry felt the empty, echoing feeling in his

head disappear. He remembered exactly what was

happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to

double.

“Look at that, you lot ... Potter fought! He fought it,

and he damn near beat it! We’ll try that again, Potter,

and the rest of you, pay attention — watch his eyes,

that’s where you see it — very good, Potter, very good

indeed! They’ll have trouble controlling you!”

“The way he talks,” Harry muttered as he hobbled out

of the Defense Against the Dark Arts class an hour

later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry through

 

his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw

off the curse entirely), “you’d think we were all going

to be attacked any second.”

“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, who was skipping on every

alternate step. He had had much more difficulty with

the curse than Harry, though Moody assured him the

effects would wear off by lunch-time. “Talk about

paranoid ...” Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder

to check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and

went on. “No wonder they were glad to get shot of him

at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus

what he did to that witch who shouted ‘Boo’ behind

him on April Fools’ Day? And when are we supposed

to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with

everything else we’ve got to do?”

All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in

the amount of work they were required to do this

term. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the

class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of

Transfiguration homework she had assigned.

“You are now entering a most important phase of your

magical education!” she told them, her eyes glinting

dangerously behind her square spectacles. “Your

Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer — ”

“We don’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!” said Dean

Thomas indignantly.

“Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the

preparation you can get! Miss Granger remains the

only person in this class who has managed to turn a

hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might

remind you that your pincushion, Thomas, still curls

up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed

to be trying not to look too pleased with herself.

Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor

Trelawney told them that they had received top marks

for their homework in their next Divination class. She

read out large portions of their predictions,

commending them for their unflinching acceptance of

the horrors in store for them — but they were less

amused when she asked them to do the same thing

for the month after next; both of them were running

out of ideas for catastrophes.

Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught

History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on

the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century.

Professor Snape was forcing them to research

antidotes. They took this one seriously, as he had

hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before

Christmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor

Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in

preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.

Even Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-

Ended Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace

given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate.

Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their “project,”

suggested that they come down to his hut on

alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make

notes on their extraordinary behavior.

“I will not,” said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had

proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling

an extra- large toy out of his sack. “I see enough of

these foul things during lessons, thanks.”

Hagrid ’s smile faded off his face.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Yeh’ll do wha’yer told,” he growled, “or I’ll be takin’ a

leaf outta Professor Moody’s book. ... I hear yeh made

a good ferret, Malfoy.”

The Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed

with anger, but apparently the memory of Moody’s

punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him

from retorting. Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to

the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits;

seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly

satisfying, especially because Malfoy had done his

very best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year.

When they arrived in the entrance hall, they found

themselves unable to proceed owing to the large

crowd of students congregated there, all milling

around a large sign that had been erected at the foot

of the marble staircase. Ron, the tallest of the three,

stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them

and read the sign aloud to the other two:

TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT

The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang

will be arriving at 6 o’clock on Friday the 30th of

October. Lessons will end half an hour early —

“Brilliant!” said Harry. “It’s Potions last thing on

Friday! Snape won’t have time to poison us all!”

Students will return their bags and books to their

dormitories and assemble in front of the castle to

greet our guests before the Welcoming Feast.

“Only a week away!” said Ernie Macmillan of

Hufflepuff, emerging from the crowd, his eyes

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

gleaming. “I wonder if Cedric knows? Think 111 go and

tell him. ...”

“Cedric?” said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off.

“Diggory,” said Harry. “He must be entering the

tournament.”

“That idiot, Hogwarts champion?” said Ron as they

pushed their way through the chattering crowd

toward the staircase.

“He’s not an idiot. You just don’t like him because he

beat Gryffindor at Quidditch,” said Hermione. “I’ve

heard he’s a really good student — and he’s a

prefect.”

She spoke as though this settled the matter.

“You only like him because he’s handsome,” said Ron

scathingly.

“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re

handsome!” said Hermione indignantly.

Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly

like “Lockhart\”

The appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a

marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle.

During the following week, there seemed to be only

one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry

went: the Triwizard Tournament. Rumors were flying

from student to student like highly contagious germs:

who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what

the tournament would involve, how the students from

Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from

themselves.

 

Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be

undergoing an extra-thorough cleaning. Several grimy

portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure

of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames

muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw

pink faces. The suits of armor were suddenly

gleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus

Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to

any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he

terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.

Other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.

“Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can’t even

perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone

from Durmstrang!” Professor McGonagall barked at

the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during

which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own

ears onto a cactus.

When they went down to breakfast on the morning of

the thirtieth of October, they found that the Great

Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk

banners hung from the walls, each of them

representing a Hogwarts House: red with a gold lion

for Gryffindor, blue with a bronze eagle for

Ravenclaw, yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff,

and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin. Behind

the teachers’ table, the largest banner of all bore the

Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake

united around a large letter H.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and

George at the Gryffindor table. Once again, and most

unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else

and conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to

them.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“It’s a bummer, all right,” George was saying gloomily

to Fred. “But if he won’t talk to us in person, we’ll

have to send him the letter after all. Or we’ll stuff it

into his hand. He can’t avoid us forever.”

“Who’s avoiding you?” said Ron, sitting down next to

them.

“Wish you would,” said Fred, looking irritated at the

interruption.

“What’s a bummer?” Ron asked George.

“Having a nosy git like you for a brother,” said George.

“You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament

yet?” Harry asked. “Thought any more about trying to

enter?”

“I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen

but she wasn’t telling,” said George bitterly. “She just

told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my

raccoon.”

“Wonder what the tasks are going to be?” said Ron

thoughtfully. “You know, I bet we could do them,

Harry. We’ve done dangerous stuff before. ...”

“Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven’t,” said

Fred. “McGonagall says the champions get awarded

points according to how well they’ve done the tasks.”

“Who are the judges?” Harry asked.

“Well, the Heads of the participating schools are

always on the panel,” said Hermione, and everyone

looked around at her, rather surprised, “because all

three of them were injured during the Tournament of

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

1792, when a cockatrice the champions were

supposed to be catching went on the rampage.”

She noticed them all looking at her and said, with her

usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all

the books she had, “It’s all in Hogwarts, A History.

Though, of course, that book’s not entirely reliable. A

Revised History of Hogwarts would be a more

accurate title. Or A Highly Biased and Selective

History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier

Aspects of the School.”

“What are you on about?” said Ron, though Harry

thought he knew what was coming.

“ House-elves\” said Hermione, her eyes flashing. “Not

once, in over a thousand pages, does Hogwarts, A

History mention that we are all colluding in the

oppression of a hundred slaves!”

Harry shook his head and applied himself to his

scrambled eggs. His and Ron’s lack of enthusiasm

had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione ’s

determination to pursue justice for house-elves. True,

both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W.

badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet.

Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything,

they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous.

She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since,

first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do

the same, and she had also taken to rattling around

the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering

people and shaking the collecting tin under their

noses.

“You do realize that your sheets are changed, your

fires lit, your classrooms cleaned, and your food

cooked by a group of magical creatures who are

unpaid and enslaved?” she kept saying fiercely.

 

Some people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop

Hermione from glowering at them. A few seemed

mildly interested in what she had to say, but were

reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning.

Many regarded the whole thing as a joke.

Ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was

flooding them all in autumn sunlight, and Fred

became extremely interested in his bacon (both twins

had refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George,

however, leaned in toward Hermione.

“Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens,

Hermione?”

“No, of course not,” said Hermione curtly, “I hardly

think students are supposed to — ”

“Well, we have,” said George, indicating Fred, “loads

of times, to nick food. And we’ve met them, and

they’re happy. They think they’ve got the best job in

the world — ”

“That’s because they’re uneducated and

brainwashed!” Hermione began hotly, but her next

few words were drowned out by the sudden

whooshing noise from overhead, which announced

the arrival of the post owls. Harry looked up at once,

and saw Hedwig soaring toward him. Hermione

stopped talking abruptly; she and Ron watched

Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry’s

shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg

wearily.

Harry pulled off Sirius’s reply and offered Hedwig his

bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully. Then, checking

that Fred and George were safely immersed in further

discussions about the Tri-wizard Tournament, Harry

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

read out Sirius’s letter in a whisper to Ron and

Hermione.

Nice try, Harry.

I’m back in the country and well hidden. I want you to

keep me posted on everything that’s going on at

Hog warts. Don’t use Hedwig, keep changing owls, and

don’t worry about me, just watch out for yourself. Don’t

forget what I said about your scar.

Sirius

“Why d’you have to keep changing owls?” Ron asked

in a low voice.

“Hedwig’ll attract too much attention,” said Hermione

at once. “She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps

returning to wherever he’s hiding ... I mean, they’re

not native birds, are they?”

Harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his

robes, wondering whether he felt more or less worried

than before. He supposed that Sirius managing to get

back without being caught was something. He

couldn’t deny either that the idea that Sirius was

much nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn’t

have to wait so long for a response every time he

wrote.

“Thanks, Hedwig,” he said, stroking her. She hooted

sleepily, dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of

orange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for

a good long sleep in the Owlery.

There was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air

that day. Nobody was very attentive in lessons, being

much more interested in the arrival that evening of

the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even

 

Potions was more bearable than usual, as it was half

an hour shorter. When the bell rang early, Harry,

Ron, and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower,

deposited their bags and books as they had been

instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back

downstairs into the entrance hall.

The Heads of Houses were ordering their students

into lines.

“Weasley, straighten your hat,” Professor McGonagall

snapped at Ron. “Miss Patil, take that ridiculous

thing out of your hair.”

Parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental

butterfly from the end of her plait.

“Follow me, please,” said Professor McGonagall. “First

years in front ... no pushing. ...”

They filed down the steps and lined up in front of the

castle. It was a cold, clear evening; dusk was falling

and a pale, transparent-looking moon was already

shining over the Forbidden Forest. Harry, standing

between Ron and Hermione in the fourth row from

the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering

with anticipation among the other first years.

“Nearly six,” said Ron, checking his watch and then

staring down the drive that led to the front gates.

“How d’you reckon they’re coming? The train?”

“I doubt it,” said Hermione.

“How, then? Broomsticks?” Harry suggested, looking

up at the starry sky.

“I don’t think so ... not from that far away. ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“A Portkey?” Ron suggested. “Or they could Apparate

— maybe you’re allowed to do it under seventeen

wherever they come from?”

“You can’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds,

how often do I have to tell you?” said Hermione

impatiently.

They scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but

nothing was moving; everything was still, silent, and

quite as usual. Harry was starting to feel cold. He

wished they’d hurry up. ... Maybe the foreign

students were preparing a dramatic entrance. ... He

remembered what Mr. Weasley had said back at the

campsite before the Quidditch World Cup: “always the

same — we can’t resist showing off when we get

together. ...”

And then Dumbledore called out from the back row

where he stood with the other teachers —

“Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation

from Beauxbatons approaches!”

“Where?” said many students eagerly, all looking in

different directions.

“There!” yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest.

Something large, much larger than a broomstick —

or, indeed, a hundred broomsticks — was hurtling

across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing

larger all the time.

“It’s a dragon!” shrieked one of the first years, losing

her head completely.

“Don’t be stupid ... it’s a flying house!” said Dennis

Creevey.

 

Dennis’s guess was closer. ... As the gigantic black

shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden

Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows

hit it, they saw a gigantic, powder-blue, horse-drawn

carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward

them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged

horses, all palominos, and each the size of an

elephant.

The front three rows of students drew backward as

the carriage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a

tremendous speed — then, with an almighty crash

that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin

fifth year’s foot, the horses’ hooves, larger than dinner

plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage

landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the

golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled

large, fiery red eyes.

Harry just had time to see that the door of the

carriage bore a coat of arms (two crossed, golden

wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened.

A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the

carriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with

something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of

golden steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then

Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging

from the inside of the carriage — a shoe the size of a

child’s sled — followed, almost immediately, by the

largest woman he had ever seen in his life. The size of

the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately

explained. A few people gasped.

Harry had only ever seen one person as large as this

woman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted

whether there was an inch difference in their heights.

Yet somehow — maybe simply because he was used

to Hagrid — this woman (now at the foot of the steps,

 

and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd)

seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped

into the light flooding from the entrance hall, she was

revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face;

large, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky

nose. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at

the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to

foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals

gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.

Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following

his lead, broke into applause too, many of them

standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.

Her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked

forward toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering

hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to

bend to kiss it.

“My dear Madame Maxime,” he said. “Welcome to

Hogwarts.”

“Dumbly-dorr,” said Madame Maxime in a deep voice.

“I ’ope I find you well?”

“In excellent form, I thank you,” said Dumbledore.

“My pupils,” said Madame Maxime, waving one of her

enormous hands carelessly behind her.

Harry, whose attention had been focused completely

upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a

dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their

late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were

now standing behind Madame Maxime. They were

shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their

robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of

them were wearing cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves

and shawls around their heads. From what Harry

 

could see of them (they were standing in Madame

Maxime ’s enormous shadow), they were staring up at

Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces.

“ ’As Karkaroff arrived yet?” Madame Maxime asked.

“He should be here any moment,” said Dumbledore.

“Would you like to wait here and greet him or would

you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?”

“Warm up, I think,” said Madame Maxime. “But ze

’orses — ”

“Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be

delighted to take care of them,” said Dumbledore, “the

moment he has returned from dealing with a slight

situation that has arisen with some of his other — er

— charges.”

“Skrewts,” Ron muttered to Harry, grinning.

“My steeds require — er — forceful ’andling,” said

Madame Maxime, looking as though she doubted

whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at

Hogwarts could be up to the job. “Zey are very strong.

“I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,”

said Dumbledore, smiling.

“Very well,” said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly.

“Will you please inform zis ’Agrid zat ze ’orses drink

only single-malt whiskey?”

“It will be attended to,” said Dumbledore, also bowing.

“Come,” said Madame Maxime imperiously to her

students, and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her

and her students to pass up the stone steps.

 

“How big d’you reckon Durmstrang’s horses are going

to be?” Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around

Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.

“Well, if they’re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid

won’t be able to handle them,” said Harry. “That’s if

he hasn’t been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder

what’s up with them?”

“Maybe they’ve escaped,” said Ron hopefully.

“Oh don’t say that,” said Hermione with a shudder.

“Imagine that lot loose on the grounds. ...”

They stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the

Durmstrang party to arrive. Most people were gazing

hopefully up at the sky. For a few minutes, the

silence was broken only by Madame Maxime’s huge

horses snorting and stamping. But then —

“Can you hear something?” said Ron suddenly.

Harry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was

drifting toward them from out of the darkness: a

muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an

immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a

riverbed. ...

“The lake!” yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it.

“Look at the lake!”

From their position at the top of the lawns

overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the

smooth black surface of the water — except that the

surface was suddenly not smooth at all. Some

disturbance was taking place deep in the center; great

bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now

washing over the muddy banks — and then, out in

the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if

 

a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake’s

floor. ...

What seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise

slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool . . . and then

Harry saw the rigging. . . .

“It’s a mast!” he said to Ron and Hermione.

Slowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water,

gleaming in the moonlight. It had a strangely skeletal

look about it, as though it were a resurrected wreck,

and the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes

looked like ghostly eyes. Finally, with a great sloshing

noise, the ship emerged entirely, bobbing on the

turbulent water, and began to glide toward the bank.

A few moments later, they heard the splash of an

anchor being thrown down in the shallows, and the

thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank.

People were disembarking; they could see their

silhouettes passing the lights in the ship’s portholes.

All of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along

the lines of Crabbe and Goyle . . . but then, as they

drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light

streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their

bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing

cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur. But the

man who was leading them up to the castle was

wearing furs of a different sort: sleek and silver, like

his hair.

“Dumbledore!” he called heartily as he walked up the

slope. “How are you, my dear fellow, how are you?”

“Blooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,”

Dumbledore replied.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Karkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he

stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of

the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like

Dumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his

goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide

his rather weak chin. When he reached Dumbledore,

he shook hands with both of his own.

“Dear old Hogwarts,” he said, looking up at the castle

and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and Harry

noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes,

which remained cold and shrewd. “How good it is to

be here, how good. ... Viktor, come along, into the

warmth ... you don’t mind, Dumbledore? Viktor has a

slight head cold. ...”

Karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As

the boy passed, Harry caught a glimpse of a

prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He

didn’t need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or

the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile.

“Harry — it’s Krum\”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

t'fyfflapier- l6

THE GOBLET OF FIRE

“I don’t believe it!” Ron said, in a stunned voice, as

the Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind

the party from Durmstrang. “Krum, Harry! Viktor

Kruml”

“For heaven’s sake, Ron, he’s only a Quidditch

player,” said Hermione.

“Only a Quidditch player?” Ron said, looking at her as

though he couldn’t believe his ears. “Hermione — he’s

one of the best Seekers in the world! I had no idea he

was still at school!”

As they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of

the Hogwarts students heading for the Great Hall,

Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the

soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of

Krum’s head. Several sixth-year girls were frantically

searching their pockets as they walked —

“Oh I don’t believe it, I haven’t got a single quill on me

??

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“D’you think he’d sign my hat in lipstick?”

“Really,” Hermione said loftily as they passed the

girls, now squabbling over the lipstick.

“I’m getting his autograph if I can,” said Ron. “You

haven’t got a quill, have you, Harry?”

“Nope, they’re upstairs in my bag,” said Harry.

They walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat

down. Ron took care to sit on the side facing the

doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang

students were still gathered around it, apparently

unsure about where they should sit. The students

from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw

table. They were looking around the Great Hall with

glum expressions on their faces. Three of them were

still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.

“It’s not that cold,” said Hermione defensively. “Why

didn’t they bring cloaks?”

“Over here! Come and sit over here!” Ron hissed.

“Over here! Hermione, budge up, make a space — ”

“What?”

“Too late,” said Ron bitterly.

Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had

settled themselves at the Slytherin table. Harry could

see Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug

about this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forward to

speak to Krum.

“Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,” said

Ron scathingly. “I bet Krum can see right through

him, though ... bet he gets people fawning over him

 

all the time. ... Where d’you reckon they’re going to

sleep? We could offer him a space in our dormitory,

Harry ... I wouldn’t mind giving him my bed, I could

kip on a camp bed.”

Hermione snorted.

“They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,”

said Harry.

The Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy

furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with

expressions of interest; a couple of them were picking

up the golden plates and goblets and examining

them, apparently impressed.

Up at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding

chairs. He was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in

honor of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see

that he added four chairs, two on either side of

Dumbledore’s.

“But there are only two extra people,” Harry said.

“Why’s Filch putting out four chairs, who else is

coming?”

“Eh?” said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at

Krum.

When all the students had entered the Hall and

settled down at their House tables, the staff entered,

filing up to the top table and taking their seats. Last

in line were Professor Dumbledore, Professor

Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime. When their

headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons

leapt to their feet. A few of the Hogwarts students

laughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared quite

unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their

seats until Madame Maxime had sat down on

 

Dumbledore ’s left-hand side. Dumbledore remained

standing, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.

“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and —

most particularly — guests,” said Dumbledore,

beaming around at the foreign students. “I have great

pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and

trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and

enjoyable.”

One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler

around her head gave what was unmistakably a

derisive laugh.

“No one’s making you stay!” Hermione whispered,

bristling at her.

“The tournament will be officially opened at the end of

the feast,” said Dumbledore. “I now invite you all to

eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!”

He sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at

once and engage him in conversation.

The plates in front of them filled with food as usual.

The house-elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled

out all the stops; there was a greater variety of dishes

in front of them than Harry had ever seen, including

several that were definitely foreign.

“What’s that?” said Ron, pointing at a large dish of

some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large

steak-and-kidney pudding.

“Bouillabaisse,” said Hermione.

“Bless you,” said Ron.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“It’s French,” said Hermione, “I had it on holiday

summer before last. It’s very nice.”

“I’ll take your word for it,” said Ron, helping himself

to black pudding.

The Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded

than usual, even though there were barely twenty

additional students there; perhaps it was because

their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly

against the black of the Hogwarts’ robes. Now that

they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang

students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep

bloodred.

Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the

staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast.

He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry,

Ron, and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged

hand.

“Skrewts doing all right, Hagrid?” Harry called.

“Thrivin’,” Hagrid called back happily.

“Yeah, I’ll just bet they are,” said Ron quietly. “Looks

like they’ve finally found a food they like, doesn’t it?

Hagrid ’s fingers.”

At that moment, a voice said, “Excuse me, are you

wanting ze bouillabaisse?”

It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed

during Dumbledore’s speech. She had finally removed

her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde hair fell

almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes,

and very white, even teeth.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Ron went purple. He stared up at her, opened his

mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint

gurgling noise.

“Yeah, have it,” said Harry, pushing the dish toward

the girl.

“You ’ave finished wiz it?”

“Yeah,” Ron said breathlessly. “Yeah, it was

excellent.”

The girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off

to the Ravenclaw table. Ron was still goggling at the

girl as though he had never seen one before. Harry

started to laugh. The sound seemed to jog Ron back

to his senses.

“She’s a veelcd” he said hoarsely to Harry.

“Of course she isn’t!” said Hermione tartly. “I don’t see

anyone else gaping at her like an idiot!”

But she wasn’t entirely right about that. As the girl

crossed the Hall, many boys’ heads turned, and some

of them seemed to have become temporarily

speechless, just like Ron.

“I’m telling you, that’s not a normal girl!” said Ron,

leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her.

“They don’t make them like that at Hogwarts!”

“They make them okay at Hogwarts,” said Harry

without thinking. Cho happened to be sitting only a

few places away from the girl with the silvery hair.

“When you’ve both put your eyes back in,” said

Hermione briskly, “you’ll be able to see who’s just

arrived.”

 

She was pointing up at the staff table. The two

remaining empty seats had just been filled. Ludo

Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff’s

other side, while Mr. Crouch, Percy’s boss, was next

to Madame Maxime.

“What are they doing here?” said Harry in surprise.

“They organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn’t

they?” said Hermione. “I suppose they wanted to be

here to see it start.”

When the second course arrived they noticed a

number of unfamiliar desserts too. Ron examined an

odd sort of pale blancmange closely, then moved it

carefully a few inches to his right, so that it would be

clearly visible from the Ravenclaw table. The girl who

looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough,

however, and did not come over to get it.

Once the golden plates had been wiped clean,

Dumbledore stood up again. A pleasant sort of

tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight

thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming.

Several seats down from them, Fred and George were

leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great

concentration.

“The moment has come,” said Dumbledore, smiling

around at the sea of upturned faces. “The Triwizard

Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few

words of explanation before we bring in the casket — ”

“The what?” Harry muttered.

Ron shrugged.

“ — just to clarify the procedure that we will be

following this year. But first, let me introduce, for

 

those who do not know them, Mr. Bartemius Crouch,

Head of the Department of International Magical

Cooperation” — there was a smattering of polite

applause — “and Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the

Department of Magical Games and Sports.”

There was a much louder round of applause for

Bagman than for Crouch, perhaps because of his

fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so

much more likable. He acknowledged it with a jovial

wave of his hand. Bartemius Crouch did not smile or

wave when his name was announced. Remembering

him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup,

Harry thought he looked strange in wizard’s robes.

His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked

very odd next to Dumbledore’s long white hair and

beard.

“Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly

over the last few months on the arrangements for the

Triwizard Tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “and

they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and

Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the

champions’ efforts.”

At the mention of the word “champions,” the

attentiveness of the listening students seemed to

sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their

sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, “The

casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.”

Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner

of the Hall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a

great wooden chest encrusted with jewels. It looked

extremely old. A murmur of excited interest rose from

the watching students; Dennis Creevey actually stood

on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his

head hardly rose above anyone else’s.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“The instructions for the tasks the champions will

face this year have already been examined by Mr.

Crouch and Mr. Bagman,” said Dumbledore as Filch

placed the chest carefully on the table before him,

“and they have made the necessary arrangements for

each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced

throughout the school year, and they will test the

champions in many different ways . . . their magical

prowess — their daring — their powers of deduction

— and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.”

At this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so

absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing.

“As you know, three champions compete in the

tournament,” Dumbledore went on calmly, “one from

each of the participating schools. They will be marked

on how well they perform each of the Tournament

tasks and the champion with the highest total after

task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions

will be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of

Fire.”

Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three

times upon the top of the casket. The lid creaked

slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled

out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have

been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the

brim with dancing blue-white flames.

Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet

carefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible

to everyone in the Hall.

“Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion

must write their name and school clearly upon a slip

of parchment and drop it into the goblet,” said

Dumbledore. “Aspiring champions have twenty-four

hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow

 

night, Halloween, the goblet will return the names of

the three it has judged most worthy to represent their

schools. The goblet will be placed in the entrance hall

tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those

wishing to compete.

“To ensure that no underage student yields to

temptation,” said Dumbledore, “I will be drawing an

Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been

placed in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of

seventeen will be able to cross this line.

“Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to

compete that this tournament is not to be entered

into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by

the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the

tournament through to the end. The placing of your

name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical

contract. There can be no change of heart once you

have become a champion. Please be very sure,

therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to

play before you drop your name into the goblet. Now,

I think it is time for bed. Good night to you all.”

“An Age Line!” Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as

they all made their way across the Hall to the doors

into the entrance hall. “Well, that should be fooled by

an Aging Potion, shouldn’t it? And once your name’s

in that goblet, you’re laughing — it can’t tell whether

you’re seventeen or not!”

“But I don’t think anyone under seventeen will stand

a chance,” said Hermione, “we just haven’t learned

enough ...”

“Speak for yourself,” said George shortly. “You’ll try

and get in, won’t you, Harry?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry thought briefly of Dumbledore ’s insistence that

nobody under seventeen should submit their name,

but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the

Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again. ... He

wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if

someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get

over the Age Line. ...

“Where is he?” said Ron, who wasn’t listening to a

word of this conversation, but looking through the

crowd to see what had become of Krum. “Dumbledore

didn’t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping,

did he?”

But this query was answered almost instantly; they

were level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff

had just bustled up to his students.

“Back to the ship, then,” he was saying. “Viktor, how

are you feeling? Did you eat enough? Should I send

for some mulled wine from the kitchens?”

Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs

back on.

“Professor, I vood like some vine,” said one of the

other Durmstrang boys hopefully.

“I wasn’t offering it to you, Poliakoff,” snapped

Karkaroff, his warmly paternal air vanishing in an

instant. “I notice you have dribbled food all down the

front of your robes again, disgusting boy — ”

Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the

doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as

Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry stopped to let him

walk through first.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Thank you,” said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at

him.

And then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to

Harry and stared at him as though he couldn’t believe

his eyes. Behind their headmaster, the students from

Durmstrang came to a halt too. Karkaroff s eyes

moved slowly up Harry’s face and fixed upon his scar.

The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at

Harry too. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw

comprehension dawn on a few of their faces. The boy

with food all down his front nudged the girl next to

him and pointed openly at Harry’s forehead.

“Yeah, that’s Harry Potter,” said a growling voice from

behind them.

Professor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody

was standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his

magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang

headmaster.

The color drained from Karkaroff’s face as Harry

watched. A terrible look of mingled fury and fear came

over him.

“You!” he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he

was really seeing him.

“Me,” said Moody grimly. “And unless you’ve got

anything to say to Potter, Karkaroff, you might want

to move. You’re blocking the doorway.”

It was true; half the students in the Hall were now

waiting behind them, looking over one another’s

shoulders to see what was causing the holdup.

Without another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his

students away with him. Moody watched him until he

 

was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back,

a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.

As the next day was Saturday, most students would

normally have breakfasted late. Harry, Ron, and

Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much

earlier than they usually did on weekends. When they

went down into the entrance hall, they saw about

twenty people milling around it, some of them eating

toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been

placed in the center of the hall on the stool that

normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had

been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet

around it in every direction.

“Anyone put their name in yet?” Ron asked a third-

year girl eagerly.

“All the Durmstrang lot,” she replied. “But I haven’t

seen anyone from Hogwarts yet.”

“Bet some of them put it in last night after we’d all

gone to bed,” said Harry. “I would’ve if it had been me

... wouldn’t have wanted everyone watching. What if

the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?”

Someone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw

Fred, George, and Lee Jordan hurrying down the

staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.

“Done it,” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry,

Ron, and Hermione. “Just taken it.”

“What?” said Ron.

“The Aging Potion, dung brains,” said Fred.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“One drop each,” said George, rubbing his hands

together with glee. “We only need to be a few months

older.”

“We’re going to split the thousand Galleons between

the three of us if one of us wins,” said Lee, grinning

broadly.

“I’m not sure this is going to work, you know,” said

Hermione warningly “I’m sure Dumbledore will have

thought of this.”

Fred, George, and Lee ignored her.

“Ready?” Fred said to the other two, quivering with

excitement. “C’mon, then — I’ll go first — ”

Harry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of

parchment out of his pocket bearing the words Fred

Weasley — Hog warts. Fred walked right up to the

edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes

like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop. Then, with

the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon

him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line.

For a split second Harry thought it had worked —

George certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of

triumph and leapt after Fred — but next moment,

there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were

hurled out of the golden circle as though they had

been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed

painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to

add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise,

and both of them sprouted identical long white

beards.

The entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and

George joined in, once they had gotten to their feet

and taken a good look at each other’s beards.

 

“I did warn you,” said a deep, amused voice, and

everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming

out of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and George,

his eyes twinkling. “I suggest you both go up to

Madam Pomfrey. She is already tending to Miss

Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of

Hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves

up a little too. Though I must say, neither of their

beards is anything like as fine as yours.”

Fred and George set off for the hospital wing,

accompanied by Lee, who was howling with laughter,

and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went

in to breakfast.

The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this

morning. As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was

fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while

hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every

corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus,

who were discussing those Hogwarts students of

seventeen or over who might be entering.

“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up

early and put his name in,” Dean told Harry. “That

big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.”

Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington,

shook his head in disgust.

“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”

“And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,”

said Seamus contemptuously. “But I wouldn’t have

thought he’d have wanted to risk his good looks.”

“Listen!” said Hermione suddenly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

People were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all

swiveled around in their seats and saw Angelina

Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an

embarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who played

Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina

came over to them, sat down, and said, “Well, I’ve

done it! Just put my name in!”

“You’re kidding!” said Ron, looking impressed.

“Are you seventeen, then?” asked Harry.

“ ’Course she is, can’t see a beard, can you?” said

Ron.

“I had my birthday last week,” said Angelina.

“Well, I’m glad someone from Gryffindor’s entering,”

said Hermione. “I really hope you get it, Angelina!”

“Thanks, Hermione,” said Angelina, smiling at her.

“Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory,” said

Seamus, causing several Hufflepuffs passing their

table to scowl heavily at him.

“What’re we going to do today, then?” Ron asked

Harry and Hermione when they had finished

breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.

“We haven’t been down to visit Hagrid yet,” said

Harry.

“Okay,” said Ron, “just as long as he doesn’t ask us to

donate a few fingers to the skrewts.”

A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on

Hermione ’s face.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I’ve just realized — I haven’t asked Hagrid to join

S.P.E.W. yet!” she said brightly. “Wait for me, will

you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?”

“What is it with her?” said Ron, exasperated, as

Hermione ran away up the marble staircase.

“Hey, Ron,” said Harry suddenly. “It’s your friend ...”

The students from Beauxbatons were coming through

the front doors from the grounds, among them, the

veela-girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire

stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.

Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students

and organized them into a line. One by one, the

Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line

and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-

white flames. As each name entered the fire, it turned

briefly red and emitted sparks.

“What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who aren’t

chosen?” Ron muttered to Harry as the veela-girl

dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire.

“Reckon they’ll go back to school, or hang around to

watch the tournament?”

“Dunno,” said Harry. “Hang around, I suppose. ...

Madame Maxime’s staying to judge, isn’t she?”

When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted

their names, Madame Maxime led them back out of

the hall and out onto the grounds again.

“Where are they sleeping, then?” said Ron, moving

toward the front doors and staring after them.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

A loud rattling noise behind them announced

Hermione’s reappearance with the box of S.P.E.W.

badges.

“Oh good, hurry up,” said Ron, and he jumped down

the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the

veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with

Madame Maxime.

As they neared Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the

Forbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons’

sleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic powder-

blue carriage in which they had arrived had been

parked two hundred yards from Hagrid’s front door,

and the students were climbing back inside it. The

elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage

were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it.

Harry knocked on Hagrid’s door, and Fang’s booming

barks answered instantly

“ ’Bout time!” said Hagrid, when he’d flung open the

door. “Thought you lot’d forgotten where I live!”

“We’ve been really busy, Hag — ” Hermione started to

say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid,

apparently lost for words.

Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy

brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie.

This wasn’t the worst of it, though; he had evidently

tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what

appeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked down

into two bunches — perhaps he had tried a ponytail

like Bill’s, but found he had too much hair. The look

didn’t really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment,

Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding

not to comment, she said, “Erm — where are the

skrewts?”

 

“Out by the pumpkin patch,” said Hagrid happily.

“They’re gettin’ massive, mus’ be nearly three foot

long now. On’y trouble is, they’ve started killin’ each

other.”

“Oh no, really?” said Hermione, shooting a repressive

look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid’s odd hairstyle,

had just opened his mouth to say something about it.

“Yeah,” said Hagrid sadly. “ ’S’ okay, though, I’ve got

’em in separate boxes now. Still got abou’ twenty.”

“Well, that’s lucky,” said Ron. Hagrid missed the

sarcasm.

Hagrid’s cabin comprised a single room, in one corner

of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork

quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs

stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured

hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. They

sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make

tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion

of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as

excited about it as they were.

“You wait,” he said, grinning. “You jus’ wait. Yer going

ter see some stuff yeh’ve never seen before. Firs’ task

... ah, but I’m not supposed ter say.”

“Go on, Hagrid!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged

him, but he just shook his head, grinning.

“I don’ want ter spoil it fer yeh,” said Hagrid. “But it’s

gonna be spectacular, I’ll tell yeh that. Them

champions ’re going ter have their work cut out. Never

thought I’d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament

played again!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

They ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they

didn’t eat much — Hagrid had made what he said was

a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a

large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost

their appetites. However, they enjoyed themselves

trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the

tournament were going to be, speculating which of

the entrants were likely to be selected as champions,

and wondering whether Fred and George were

beardless yet.

A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was

very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle

patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid

darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about

house-elves — for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W.

when she showed him her badges.

“It’d be doin’ ’em an unkindness, Hermione,” he said

gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick

yellow yarn. “It’s in their nature ter look after

humans, that’s what they like, see? Yeh’d be makin’

’em unhappy ter take away their work, an’ insultin’

’em if yeh tried ter pay ’em.”

“But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon

about it!” said Hermione. “And we heard he’s asking

for wages now!”

“Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I’m not

sayin’ there isn’t the odd elf who’d take freedom, but

yeh’ll never persuade most of ’em ter do it — no,

nothin’ doin’, Hermione.”

Hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her

box of badges back into her cloak pocket.

By half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry,

and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to

 

the castle for the Halloween feast — and, more

important, the announcement of the school

champions.

“I’ll come with yeh,” said Hagrid, putting away his

darning. “Jus’ give us a sec.”

Hagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers

beside his bed, and began searching for something

inside it. They didn’t pay too much attention until a

truly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing,

Ron said, “Hagrid, what’s that?”

“Eh?” said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle

in his hand. “Don’ yeh like it?”

“Is that aftershave?” said Hermione in a slightly

choked voice.

“Er — eau de cologne,” Hagrid muttered. He was

blushing. “Maybe it’s a bit much,” he said gruffly. “I’ll

go take it off, hang on . . .

He stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him

washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside

the window.

“Eau de cologne?” said Hermione in amazement.

“Hagrid?”

“And what’s with the hair and the suit?” said Harry in

an undertone.

“Look!” said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the

window.

Hagrid had just straightened up and turned ’round. If

he had been blushing before, it was nothing to what

he was doing now. Getting to their feet very

 

cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn’t spot them, Harry,

Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and

saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons

students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly

about to set off for the feast too. They couldn’t hear

what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to

Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression

Harry had only ever seen him wear once before —

when he had been looking at the baby dragon,

Norbert.

“He’s going up to the castle with her!” said Hermione

indignantly. “I thought he was waiting for us!”

Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin,

Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame

Maxime, the Beauxbatons students following in their

wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.

“He fancies her!” said Ron incredulously. “Well, if they

end up having children, they’ll be setting a world

record — bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a

ton.”

They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the

door behind them. It was surprisingly dark outside.

Drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves,

they set off up the sloping lawns.

“Ooh it’s them, look!” Hermione whispered.

The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the

castle from the lake. Viktor Krum was walking side by

side with Karkaroff, and the other Durmstrang

students were straggling along behind them. Ron

watched Krum excitedly, but Krum did not look

around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of

Hermione, Ron, and Harry and proceeded through

them.

 

When they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was

almost full. The Goblet of Fire had been moved; it was

now standing in front of Dumbledore ’s empty chair at

the teachers’ table. Fred and George — clean-shaven

again — seemed to have taken their disappointment

fairly well.

“Hope it’s Angelina,” said Fred as Harry, Ron, and

Hermione sat down.

“So do I!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Well, we’ll

soon know!”

The Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than

usual. Perhaps because it was their second feast in

two days, Harry didn’t seem to fancy the

extravagantly prepared food as much as he would

have normally. Like everyone else in the Hall, judging

by the constantly craning necks, the impatient

expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the

standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished

eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear,

and to hear who had been selected as champions.

At long last, the golden plates returned to their

original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in

the level of noise within the Hall, which died away

almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. On

either side of him, Professor Karkaroff and Madame

Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone.

Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various

students. Mr. Crouch, however, looked quite

uninterested, almost bored.

“Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,”

said Dumbledore. “I estimate that it requires one

more minute. Now, when the champions’ names are

called, I would ask them please to come up to the top

of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through

 

into the next chamber” — he indicated the door

behind the staff table — “where they will be receiving

their first instructions.”

He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave

with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the

carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them

into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now

shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall,

the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames

almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched,

waiting. ... A few people kept checking their watches.

“Any second,” Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away

from Harry.

The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red

again. Sparks began to fly from it. Next moment, a

tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of

parchment fluttered out of it — the whole room

gasped.

Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held

it at arm’s length, so that he could read it by the light

of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.

“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong,

clear voice, “will be Viktor Krum.”

“No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of

applause and cheering swept the Hall. Harry saw

Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch

up toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along

the staff table, and disappeared through the door into

the next chamber.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Bravo, Viktor!” boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that

everyone could hear him, even over all the applause.

“Knew you had it in you!”

The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone’s

attention was focused again on the goblet, which,

seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece

of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.

“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore,

“is Fleur Delacour!”

“It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so

resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook

back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up

between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.

“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said

over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the

Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of an

understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who

had not been selected had dissolved into tears and

were sobbing with their heads on their arms.

When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side

chamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a

silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste

it. The Hogwarts champion next ...

And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks

showered out of it; the tongue of flame shot high into

the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third

piece of parchment.

“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric

Diggory!”

“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except

Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great.

 

Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet,

screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way

past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward

the chamber behind the teachers’ table. Indeed, the

applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some

time before Dumbledore could make himself heard

again.

“Excellent!” Dumbledore called happily as at last the

tumult died down. “Well, we now have our three

champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you,

including the remaining students from Beauxbatons

and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce

of support you can muster. By cheering your

champion on, you will contribute in a very real — ”

But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it

was apparent to everybody what had distracted him.

The fire in the goblet had just turned red again.

Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot

suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another

piece of parchment.

Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a

long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out

and stared at the name written upon it. There was a

long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the

slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at

Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat

and read out —

“ Harry Potter.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE FOUR CHAMPIONS

Harry sat there, aware that every head in the Great

Hall had turned to look at him. He was stunned. He

felt numb. He was surely dreaming. He had not heard

correctly.

There was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry

bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were

standing up to get a better look at Harry as he sat,

frozen, in his seat.

Up at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to

her feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor

Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor

Dumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning

slightly.

Harry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he

saw the long Gryffindor table all watching him,

openmouthed.

“I didn’t put my name in,” Harry said blankly. “You

know I didn’t.”

 

Both of them stared just as blankly back.

At the top table, Professor Dumbledore had

straightened up, nodding to Professor McGonagall.

“Harry Potter!” he called again. “Harry! Up here, if you

please!”

“Go on,” Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight

push.

Harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes,

and stumbled slightly. He set off up the gap between

the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It felt like an

immensely long walk; the top table didn’t seem to be

getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds

and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were

a searchlight. The buzzing grew louder and louder.

After what seemed like an hour, he was right in front

of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers

upon him.

“Well ... through the door, Harry,” said Dumbledore.

He wasn’t smiling.

Harry moved off along the teachers’ table. Hagrid was

seated right at the end. He did not wink at Harry, or

wave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting. He

looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as

he passed like everyone else. Harry went through the

door out of the Great Hall and found himself in a

smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and

wizards. A handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace

opposite him.

The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he

entered. He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame

of her picture and into the one next to it, which

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The

wizened witch started whispering in his ear.

Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour

were grouped around the fire. They looked strangely

impressive, silhouetted against the flames. Krum,

hunched-up and brooding, was leaning against the

mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Cedric

was standing with his hands behind his back, staring

into the fire. Fleur Delacour looked around when

Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long,

silvery hair.

“What is it?” she said. “Do zey want us back in ze

Hall?”

She thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry

didn’t know how to explain what had just happened.

He just stood there, looking at the three champions. It

struck him how very tall all of them were.

There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and

Ludo Bagman entered the room. He took Harry by the

arm and led him forward.

“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm.

“Absolutely extraordinary! Gentlemen ... lady,” he

added, approaching the fireside and addressing the

other three. “May I introduce — incredible though it

may seem — the fourth Triwizard champion?”

Viktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened

as he surveyed Harry. Cedric looked nonplussed. He

looked from Bagman to Harry and back again as

though sure he must have misheard what Bagman

had said. Fleur Delacour, however, tossed her hair,

smiling, and said, “Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester

Bagman.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered. “No, no, not at

all! Harry’s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire!”

Krum’s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was

still looking politely bewildered. Fleur frowned.

“But evidently zair ’as been a mistake,” she said

contemptuously to Bagman. “ ’E cannot compete. ’E is

too young.”

“Well ... it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his

smooth chin and smiling down at Harry. “But, as you

know, the age restriction was only imposed this year

as an extra safety measure. And as his name’s come

out of the goblet ... I mean, I don’t think there can be

any ducking out at this stage. ... It’s down in the

rules, you’re obliged ... Harry will just have to do the

best he — ”

The door behind them opened again, and a large

group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore,

followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff,

Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and

Professor Snape. Harry heard the buzzing of the

hundreds of students on the other side of the wall,

before Professor McGonagall closed the door.

“Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once, striding over to

her headmistress. “Zey are saying zat zis little boy is

to compete also!”

Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a

ripple of anger. Little boy ?

Madame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full,

and considerable, height. The top of her handsome

head brushed the candle-filled chandelier, and her

gigantic black-satin bosom swelled.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?” she said

imperiously.

“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,”

said Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely

smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. “Two

Hogwarts champions? I don’t remember anyone

telling me the host school is allowed two champions

— or have I not read the rules carefully enough?”

He gave a short and nasty laugh.

“C’est impossible,” said Madame Maxime, whose

enormous hand with its many superb opals was

resting upon Fleur’s shoulder. “ ’Ogwarts cannot ’ave

two champions. It is most injust.”

“We were under the impression that your Age Line

would keep out younger contestants, Dumbledore,”

said Karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though

his eyes were colder than ever. “Otherwise, we would,

of course, have brought along a wider selection of

candidates from our own schools.”

“It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,” said Snape

softly. His black eyes were alight with malice. “Don’t

go blaming Dumbledore for Potter’s determination to

break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he

arrived here — ”

“Thank you, Severus,” said Dumbledore firmly, and

Snape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted

malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair.

Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at

Harry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern

the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon

spectacles.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire,

Harry?” he asked calmly.

“No,” said Harry. He was very aware of everybody

watching him closely. Snape made a soft noise of

impatient disbelief in the shadows.

“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet

of Fire for you?” said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring

Snape.

“No,” said Harry vehemently.

“Ah, but of course ’e is lying!” cried Madame Maxime.

Snape was now shaking his head, his lip curling.

“He could not have crossed the Age Line,” said

Professor McGonagall sharply. “I am sure we are all

agreed on that — ”

“Dumbly-dorr must ’ave made a mistake wiz ze line,”

said Madame Maxime, shrugging.

“It is possible, of course,” said Dumbledore politely

“Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not

make a mistake!” said Professor McGonagall angrily.

“Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have crossed

the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore

believes that he did not persuade an older student to

do it for him, I’m sure that should be good enough for

everybody else!”

She shot a very angry look at Professor Snape.

“Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Bagman,” said Karkaroff, his voice

unctuous once more, “you are our — er — objective

judges. Surely you will agree that this is most

irregular?”

 

Bagman wiped his round, boyish face with his

handkerchief and looked at Mr. Crouch, who was

standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face

half hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the

half darkness making him look much older, giving

him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke,

however, it was in his usual curt voice.

“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly

that those people whose names come out of the

Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the

tournament.”

“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said

Bagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and

Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now

closed.

“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of

my students,” said Karkaroff. He had dropped his

unctuous tone and his smile now. His face wore a

very ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of

Fire once more, and we will continue adding names

until each school has two champions. It’s only fair,

Dumbledore.”

“But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said

Bagman. “The Goblet of Fire’s just gone out — it won’t

reignite until the start of the next tournament — ”

“ — in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be

competing!” exploded Karkaroff. “After all our

meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little

expected something of this nature to occur! I have

half a mind to leave now!”

“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near

the door. “You can’t leave your champion now. He’s

got to compete. They’ve all got to compete. Binding

 

magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient,

eh?”

Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward

the fire, and with every right step he took, there was a

loud clunk.

“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t

understand you, Moody.”

Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as

though what Moody was saying was barely worth his

notice, but his hands gave him away; they had balled

themselves into fists.

“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple,

Karkaroff. Someone put Potter’s name in that goblet

knowing he’d have to compete if it came out.”

“Evidently, someone ’oo wished to give ’Ogwarts two

bites at ze apple!” said Madame Maxime.

“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff,

bowing to her. “I shall be lodging complaints with the

Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation

of Wizards — ”

“If anyone’s got reason to complain, it’s Potter,”

growled Moody, “but ... funny thing ... I don’t hear

him saying a word. ...”

“Why should ’e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour,

stamping her foot. “ ’E ’as ze chance to compete, ’asn’t

’e? We ’ave all been ’oping to be chosen for weeks and

weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons

in prize money — zis is a chance many would die for!”

“Maybe someone’s hoping Potter is going to die for it,”

said Moody, with the merest trace of a growl.

 

An extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo

Bagman, who was looking very anxious indeed,

bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said,

“Moody, old man ... what a thing to say!”

“We all know Professor Moody considers the morning

wasted if he hasn’t discovered six plots to murder him

before lunchtime,” said Karkaroff loudly. “Apparently

he is now teaching his students to fear assassination

too. An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark

Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your

reasons.”

“Imagining things, am I?” growled Moody. “Seeing

things, eh? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put

the boy’s name in that goblet. ...”

“Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?” said Madame

Maxime, throwing up her huge hands.

“Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical

object!” said Moody. “It would have needed an

exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle

that goblet into forgetting that only three schools

compete in the tournament. ... I’m guessing they

submitted Potter’s name under a fourth school, to

make sure he was the only one in his category. ...”

“You seem to have given this a great deal of thought,

Moody,” said Karkaroff coldly, “and a very ingenious

theory it is — though of course, I heard you recently

got it into your head that one of your birthday

presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk

egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a

carriage clock. So you’ll understand if we don’t take

you entirely seriously. ...”

“There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to

their advantage,” Moody retorted in a menacing voice.

 

“It’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do,

Karkaroff — as you ought to remember. ...”

“Alas tor!” said Dumbledore warningly. Harry

wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to,

but then realized “Mad-Eye” could hardly be Moody’s

real first name. Moody fell silent, though still

surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction — Karkaroff’s

face was burning.

“How this situation arose, we do not know,” said

Dumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the

room. “It seems to me, however, that we have no

choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have

been chosen to compete in the Tournament. This,

therefore, they will do. ...”

“Ah, but Dumbly-dorr — ”

“My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative,

I would be delighted to hear it.”

Dumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not

speak, she merely glared. She wasn’t the only one

either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff livid; Bagman,

however, looked rather excited.

“Well, shall we crack on, then?” he said, rubbing his

hands together and smiling around the room. “Got to

give our champions their instructions, haven’t we?

Barty, want to do the honors?”

Mr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie.

“Yes,” he said, “instructions. Yes ... the first task ...”

He moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry

thought he looked ill. There were dark shadows

beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his

 

wrinkled skin that had not been there at the

Quidditch World Cup.

“The first task is designed to test your daring,” he told

Harry, Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, “so we are not going

to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the

unknown is an important quality in a wizard . . . very

important. ...

“The first task will take place on November the

twenty-fourth, in front of the other students and the

panel of judges.

“The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept

help of any kind from their teachers to complete the

tasks in the tournament. The champions will face the

first challenge armed only with their wands. They will

receive information about the second task when the

first is over. Owing to the demanding and time-

consuming nature of the tournament, the champions

are exempted from end-of-year tests.”

Mr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.

“I think that’s all, is it, Albus?”

“I think so,” said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr.

Crouch with mild concern. “Are you sure you

wouldn’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?”

“No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,”

said Mr. Crouch. “It is a very busy, very difficult time

at the moment. ... I’ve left young Weatherby in

charge. ... Very enthusiastic ... a little

overenthusiastic, if truth be told. ...”

“You’ll come and have a drink before you go, at

least?” said Dumbledore.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Come on, Barty, I’m staying!” said Bagman brightly.

“It’s all happening at Hogwarts now, you know, much

more exciting here than at the office!”

“I think not, Ludo,” said Crouch with a touch of his

old impatience.

“Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a

nightcap?” said Dumbledore.

But Madame Maxime had already put her arm

around Fleur’s shoulders and was leading her swiftly

out of the room. Harry could hear them both talking

very fast in French as they went off into the Great

Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too,

exited, though in silence.

“Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said

Dumbledore, smiling at both of them. “I am sure

Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with

you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this

excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and

noise.”

Harry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left

together.

The Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had

burned low, giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins

an eerie, flickering quality.

“So,” said Cedric, with a slight smile. “We’re playing

against each other again!”

“I s’pose,” said Harry. He really couldn’t think of

anything to say. The inside of his head seemed to be

in complete disarray, as though his brain had been

ransacked.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“So ... tell me ...” said Cedric as they reached the

entrance hall, which was now lit only by torches in

the absence of the Goblet of Fire. “How did you get

your name in?”

“I didn’t,” said Harry, staring up at him. “I didn’t put

it in. I was telling the truth.”

“Ah ... okay,” said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric

didn’t believe him. “Well ... see you, then.”

Instead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric

headed for a door to its right. Harry stood listening to

him going down the stone steps beyond it, then,

slowly, he started to climb the marble ones.

Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to

believe him, or would they all think he’d put himself

in for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think

that, when he was facing competitors who’d had three

years’ more magical education than he had — when

he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very

dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of

hundreds of people? Yes, he’d thought about it ... he’d

fantasized about it ... but it had been a joke, really,

an idle sort of dream ... he’d never really, seriously

considered entering. ...

But someone else had considered it ... someone else

had wanted him in the tournament, and had made

sure he was entered. Why? To give him a treat? He

didn’t think so, somehow. ...

To see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were

likely to get their wish. ...

But to get him killed?

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Was Moody just being his usual paranoid self?

Couldn’t someone have put Harry’s name in the

goblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really

want him dead?

Harry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone

wanted him dead, someone had wanted him dead

ever since he had been a year old ... Lord Voldemort.

But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry’s

name got into the Goblet of Fire? Voldemort was

supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in

hiding, alone ... feeble and powerless. ...

Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had

awoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not

been alone ... he had been talking to Wormtail ...

plotting Harry’s murder. . . .

Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady

already. He had barely noticed where his feet were

carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she

was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who

had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had

joined the champions downstairs was now sitting

smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed

through every picture lining seven staircases to reach

here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were

looking down at him with the keenest interest.

“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady, “Violet’s just told

me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school

champion, then?”

“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.

“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch

indignantly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady

soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to

let Harry into the common room.

The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the

portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next

thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the

common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and

was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom

were screaming, applauding, and whistling.

“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred;

he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.

“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!”

roared George.

“I didn’t,” Harry said. “I don’t know how — ”

But Angelina had now swooped down upon him; “Oh

if it couldn’t be me, at least it’s a Gryffindor — ”

“You’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last

Quidditch match, Harry!” shrieked Katie Bell, another

of the Gryffindor Chasers.

“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some — ”

“I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast — ”

But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry;

nobody wanted to hear that he hadn’t put his name in

the goblet; not one single person seemed to have

noticed that he wasn’t at all in the mood to celebrate.

... Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner

from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it

around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn’t get away;

whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to

the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks,

 

forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and

peanuts into his hands. ... Everyone wanted to know

how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore’s

Age Line and managed to get his name into the

goblet. ...

“I didn’t,” he said, over and over again, “I don’t know

how it happened.”

But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as

well not have answered at all.

“I’m tired!” he bellowed finally, after nearly half an

hour. “No, seriously, George — I’m going to bed — ”

He wanted more than anything to find Ron and

Hermione, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them

seemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he

needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little

Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at

the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake

everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as

he could.

To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed

in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed.

He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind

him.

“Where ’ve you been?” Harry said.

“Oh hello,” said Ron.

He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort

of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was

still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee

had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it

was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without

moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.

 

“So,” he said, when Harry had finally removed the

banner and thrown it into a corner.

“Congratulations . ”

“What d’you mean, congratulations?” said Harry,

staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong

with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a

grimace.

“Well ... no one else got across the Age Line,” said

Ron. “Not even Fred and George. What did you use —

the Invisibility Cloak?”

“The Invisibility Cloak wouldn’t have got me over that

line,” said Harry slowly.

“Oh right,” said Ron. “I thought you might’ve told me

if it was the cloak ... because it would’ve covered both

of us, wouldn’t it? But you found another way, did

you?”

“Listen,” said Harry, “I didn’t put my name in that

goblet. Someone else must’ve done it.”

Ron raised his eyebrows.

“What would they do that for?”

“I dunno,” said Harry. He felt it would sound very

melodramatic to say, “To kill me.”

Ron’s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger

of disappearing into his hair.

“It’s okay, you know, you can tell me the truth,” he

said. “If you don’t want everyone else to know, fine,

but I don’t know why you’re bothering to lie, you

didn’t get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of

the Fat Lady’s, that Violet, she’s already told us all

 

Dumbledore’s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons

prize money, eh? And you don’t have to do end-of-

year tests either. ...”

“I didn’t put my name in that goblet!” said Harry,

starting to feel angry.

“Yeah, okay,” said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical

tone as Cedric. “Only you said this morning you’d

have done it last night, and no one would’ve seen you.

... I’m not stupid, you know.”

“You’re doing a really good impression of it,” Harry

snapped.

“Yeah?” said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin,

forced or otherwise, on his face now. “You want to get

to bed, Harry. I expect you’ll need to be up early

tomorrow for a photo-call or something.”

He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-

poster, leaving Harry standing there by the door,

staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding

one of the few people he had been sure would believe

him.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS

When Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him

a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and

worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled

over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of

his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force

Ron to believe him — only to find that Ron’s bed was

empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.

Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into

the common room. The moment he appeared, the

people who had already finished breakfast broke into

applause again. The prospect of going down into the

Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all

treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting;

it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to

be cornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both

beckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked

resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open,

climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with

Hermione.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Hello,” she said, holding up a stack of toast, which

she was carrying in a napkin. “I brought you this. ...

Want to go for a walk?”

“Good idea,” said Harry gratefully.

They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall

quickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were

soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where

the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in

the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept

moving, munching their toast, as Harry told

Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left

the Gryffindor table the night before. To his immense

relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.

“Well, of course I knew you hadn’t entered yourself,”

she said when he’d finished telling her about the

scene in the chamber off the Hall. “The look on your

face when Dumbledore read out your name! But the

question is, who did put it in? Because Moody’s right,

Harry ... I don’t think any student could have done it

... they’d never be able to fool the Goblet, or get over

Dumbledore ’s — ”

“Have you seen Ron?” Harry interrupted.

Hermione hesitated.

“Erm ... yes ... he was at breakfast,” she said.

“Does he still think I entered myself?”

“Well ... no, I don’t think so ... not really,” said

Hermione awkwardly.

“What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Oh Harry, isn’t it obvious?” Hermione said

despairingly. “He’s jealous!”

“Jealous?” Harry said incredulously. “Jealous of

what? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of

the whole school, does he?”

“Look,” said Hermione patiently, “it’s always you who

gets all the attention, you know it is. I know it’s not

your fault,” she added quickly, seeing Harry open his

mouth furiously. “I know you don’t ask for it ... but —

well — you know, Ron’s got all those brothers to

compete against at home, and you’re his best friend,

and you’re really famous — he’s always shunted to

one side whenever people see you, and he puts up

with it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose this

is just one time too many. ...”

“Great,” said Harry bitterly. “Really great. Tell him

from me I’ll swap any time he wants. Tell him from

me he’s welcome to it. ... People gawping at my

forehead everywhere I go. ...”

“I’m not telling him anything,” Hermione said shortly.

“Tell him yourself. It’s the only way to sort this out.”

“I’m not running around after him trying to make him

grow up!” Harry said, so loudly that several owls in a

nearby tree took flight in alarm. “Maybe he’ll believe

I’m not enjoying myself once I’ve got my neck broken

or — ”

“That’s not funny,” said Hermione quietly. “That’s not

funny at all.” She looked extremely anxious. “Harry,

I’ve been thinking — you know what we’ve got to do,

don’t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to

the castle?”

“Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the — ”

 

“Write to Sirius. You’ve got to tell him what’s

happened. He asked you to keep him posted on

everything that’s going on at Hogwarts. ... It’s almost

as if he expected something like this to happen. I

brought some parchment and a quill out with me — ”

“Come off it,” said Harry, looking around to check

that they couldn’t be overheard, but the grounds were

quite deserted. “He came back to the country just

because my scar twinged. He’ll probably come

bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone’s

entered me in the Triwizard Tournament — ”

“He’d want you to tell him,” said Hermione sternly.

“He’s going to find out anyway — ”

“How?”

“Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said

Hermione, very seriously. “This tournament’s famous,

and you’re famous. Ill be really surprised if there isn’t

anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing. . . .

You’re already in half the books about You-Know-

Who, you know ... and Sirius would rather hear it

from you, I know he would.”

“Okay, okay, I’ll write to him,” said Harry, throwing

his last piece of toast into the lake. They both stood

and watched it floating there for a moment, before a

large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it

beneath the surface. Then they returned to the castle.

“Whose owl am I going to use?” Harry said as they

climbed the stairs. “He told me not to use Hedwig

again.”

“Ask Ron if you can borrow — ”

“I’m not asking Ron for anything,” Harry said flatly.

 

“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone

can use them,” said Hermione.

They went up to the Owlery Hermione gave Harry a

piece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then

strolled around the long lines of perches, looking at

all the different owls, while Harry sat down against a

wall and wrote his letter.

Dear Sirius,

You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening

at Hogwarts, so here goes — I don’t know if you’ve

heard, but the Tri-wizard Tournament’s happening this

year and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth

champion. I don’t know who put my name in the Goblet

of Fire, because I didn’t The other Hogwarts champion

is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff

He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to

say something about the large weight of anxiety that

seemed to have settled inside his chest since last

night, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into

words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink

bottle and wrote,

Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak — Harry

“Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and

brushing straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig came

fluttering down onto his shoulder and held out her

leg.

“I can’t use you,” Harry told her, looking around for

the school owls. “I’ve got to use one of these. ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly

that her talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her

back to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to

the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had

flown off, Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she

clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the

rafters out of reach.

“First Ron, then you,” said Harry angrily. “ This isn’t

my fault.”

If Harry had thought that matters would improve

once everyone got used to the idea of him being

champion, the following day showed him how

mistaken he was. He could no longer avoid the rest of

the school once he was back at lessons — and it was

clear that the rest of the school, just like the

Gryffindors, thought Harry had entered himself for

the tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors, however,

they did not seem impressed.

The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms

with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold

toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson

was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the

Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their

champion’s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by

the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any

glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had

ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at

Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-

Fletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well,

did not talk to him even though they were repotting

Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — though they did

laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing

Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip and smacked

him hard in the face. Ron wasn’t talking to Harry

either. Hermione sat between them, making very

forced conversation, but though both answered her

 

normally, they avoided making eye contact with each

other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed

distant with him — but then, she was Head of

Hufflepuff House.

He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid

under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical

Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too — the first

time he would come face-to-face with them since

becoming champion.

Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid ’s cabin with his

familiar sneer firmly in place.

“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe

and Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry.

“Got your autograph books? Better get a signature

now, because I doubt he’s going to be around much

longer. ... Half the Triwizard champions have died ...

how long d’you reckon you’re going to last, Potter?

Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.”

Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but

Malfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged

from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower

of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended

Skrewt. To the class’s horror, Hagrid proceeded to

explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing

one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and

that the solution would be for each student to fix a

leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The

only good thing about this plan was that it distracted

Malfoy completely.

“Take this thing for a walk?” he repeated in disgust,

staring into one of the boxes. “And where exactly are

we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the

blasting end, or the sucker?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Roun’ the middle,” said Hagrid, demonstrating. “Er

— yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves,

jus’ as an extra precaution, like. Harry — you come

here an’ help me with this big one. ...”

Hagrid’s real intention, however, was to talk to Harry

away from the rest of the class. He waited until

everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then

turned to Harry and said, very seriously, “So — yer

competin’, Harry. In the tournament. School

champion.”

“One of the champions,” Harry corrected him.

Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under

his wild eyebrows.

“No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?”

“You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said Harry,

concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt

at Hagrid’s words.

“ ’Course I do,” Hagrid grunted. “Yeh say it wasn’ you,

an’ I believe yeh — an’ Dumbledore believes yer, an’

all.”

“Wish I knew who did do it,” said Harry bitterly.

The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class

was widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty.

The skrewts were now over three feet long, and

extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colorless,

they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny

armor. They looked like a cross between giant

scorpions and elongated crabs — but still without

recognizable heads or eyes. They had become

immensely strong and very hard to control.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Look like they’re havin’ fun, don’ they?” Hagrid said

happily. Harry assumed he was talking about the

skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren’t;

every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of

the skrewts’ ends would explode, causing it to shoot

forward several yards, and more than one person was

being dragged along on their stomach, trying

desperately to get back on their feet.

“Ah, I don’ know, Harry,” Hagrid sighed suddenly,

looking back down at him with a worried expression

on his face. “School champion ... everythin’ seems ter

happen ter you, doesn’ it?”

Harry didn’t answer. Yes, everything did seem to

happen to him ... that was more or less what

Hermione had said as they had walked around the

lake, and that was the reason, according to her, that

Ron was no longer talking to him.

The next few days were some of Harry’s worst at

Hogwarts. The closest he had ever come to feeling like

this had been during those months, in his second

year, when a large part of the school had suspected

him of attacking his fellow students. But Ron had

been on his side then. He thought he could have

coped with the rest of the school’s behavior if he could

just have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn’t

going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron

didn’t want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike

pouring in on him from all sides.

He could understand the Hufflepuffs’ attitude, even if

he didn’t like it; they had their own champion to

support. He expected nothing less than vicious

insults from the Slytherins — he was highly

unpopular there and always had been, because he

had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at

Quidditch and in the Inter-House Championship. But

 

he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in

their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He

was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to

think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit

more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his

name.

Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of

a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally

handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray

eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more

admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum. Harry

actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been

so keen to get Krum’s autograph begging Cedric to

sign their school bags one lunchtime.

Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig

was refusing to come anywhere near him, Professor

Trelawney was predicting his death with even more

certainty than usual, and he did so badly at

Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick’s class that

he was given extra homework — the only person to

get any, apart from Neville.

“It’s really not that difficult, Harry,” Hermione tried to

reassure him as they left Flitwick’s class — she had

been making objects zoom across the room to her all

lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet

for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and

lunascopes. “You just weren’t concentrating properly

“Wonder why that was,” said Harry darkly as Cedric

Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of

simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as

though he were a particularly large Blast-Ended

Skrewt. “Still — never mind, eh? Double Potions to

look forward to this afternoon. ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Double Potions was always a horrible experience, but

these days it was nothing short of torture. Being shut

in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and

the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to

punish Harry as much as possible for daring to

become school champion, was about the most

unpleasant thing Harry could imagine. He had

already struggled through one Friday’s worth, with

Hermione sitting next to him intoning “ignore them,

ignore them, ignore them” under her breath, and he

couldn’t see why today should be any better.

When he and Hermione arrived at Snape ’s dungeon

after lunch, they found the Slytherins waiting outside,

each and every one of them wearing a large badge on

the front of his or her robes. For one wild moment

Harry thought they were S.P.E.W. badges — then he

saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous

red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit

underground passage:

Support CEDRIC DIGGORY —

The REAL Hogwarts Champion

“Like them, Potter?” said Malfoy loudly as Harry

approached. “And this isn’t all they do — look!”

He pressed his badge into his chest, and the message

upon it vanished, to be replaced by another one,

which glowed green:

POTTER STINKS

The Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them

pressed their badges too, until the message POTTER

STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry. He felt

the heat rise in his face and neck.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Oh very funny,” Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy

Parkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were

laughing harder than anyone, “really witty.”

Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and

Seamus. He wasn’t laughing, but he wasn’t sticking

up for Harry either.

“Want one, Granger?” said Malfoy, holding out a

badge to Hermione. “I’ve got loads. But don’t touch

my hand, now. I’ve just washed it, you see; don’t want

a Mudblood sliming it up.”

Some of the anger Harry had been feeling for days

and days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest.

He had reached for his wand before he’d thought

what he was doing. People all around them scrambled

out of the way, backing down the corridor.

“Harry!” Hermione said warningly.

“Go on, then, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly, drawing out

his own wand. “Moody’s not here to look after you

now — do it, if you’ve got the guts — ”

For a split second, they looked into each other’s eyes,

then, at exactly the same time, both acted.

“ FurnunculusV’ Harry yelled.

“ DensaugeoV’ screamed Malfoy.

Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in

midair, and ricocheted off at angles — Harry’s hit

Goyle in the face, and Malfoy’s hit Hermione. Goyle

bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great

ugly boils were springing up — Hermione, whimpering

in panic, was clutching her mouth.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Hermione!”

Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with

her; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione ’s

hand away from her face. It wasn’t a pretty sight.

Hermione ’s front teeth — already larger than average

— were now growing at an alarming rate; she was

looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth

elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin —

panic-stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified

cry.

“And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly

voice.

Snape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give

their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger

at Malfoy and said, “Explain.”

“Potter attacked me, sir — ”

“We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry

shouted.

“ — and he hit Goyle — look — ”

Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled

something that would have been at home in a book

on poisonous fungi.

“Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly.

“Malfoy got Hermione!” Ron said. “Loo/d”

He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth — she

was doing her best to hide them with her hands,

though this was difficult as they had now grown down

past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles,

pointing at Hermione from behind Snape ’s back.

Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no

difference.”

Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears,

she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up

the corridor and out of sight.

It was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron

started shouting at Snape at the same time; lucky

their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for

in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear

exactly what they were calling him. He got the gist,

however.

“Let’s see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points

from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and

Weasley. Now get inside, or it’ll be a week’s worth of

detentions.”

Harry’s ears were ringing. The injustice of it made

him want to curse Snape into a thousand slimy

pieces. He passed Snape, walked with Ron to the

back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto

the table. Ron was shaking with anger too — for a

moment, it felt as though everything was back to

normal between them, but then Ron turned and sat

down with Dean and Seamus instead, leaving Harry

alone at his table. On the other side of the dungeon,

Malfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his

badge, smirking. POTTER STINKS flashed once more

across the room.

Harry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began,

picturing horrific things happening to him. ... If only

he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse ... he’d have

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and

twitching. ...

“Antidotes!” said Snape, looking around at them all,

his cold black eyes glittering unpleasantly. “You

should all have prepared your recipes now. I want you

to brew them carefully, and then, we will be selecting

someone on whom to test one. ...”

Snape’s eyes met Harry’s, and Harry knew what was

coming. Snape was going to poison him. Harry

imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to

the front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape’s

greasy head —

And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on

Harry’s thoughts.

It was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room,

beaming at Harry, and walked up to Snape’s desk at

the front of the room.

“Yes?” said Snape curtly.

“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take Harry Potter

upstairs.”

Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose

smile faded from his eager face.

“Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said

Snape coldly. “He will come upstairs when this class

is finished.”

Colin went pink.

“Sir — sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said

nervously. “All the champions have got to go, I think

they want to take photographs. ...”

 

Harry would have given anything he owned to have

stopped Colin saying those last few words. He

chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring

determinedly at the ceiling.

“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped. “Potter, leave

your things here, I want you back down here later to

test your antidote.”

“Please, sir — he’s got to take his things with him,”

squeaked Colin. “All the champions — ”

“Very well\” said Snape. “Potter — take your bag and

get out of my sight!”

Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and

headed for the door. As he walked through the

Slytherin desks, POTTER STINKS flashed at him from

every direction.

“It’s amazing, isn’t it, Harry?” said Colin, starting to

speak the moment Harry had closed the dungeon

door behind him. “Isn’t it, though? You being

champion?”

“Yeah, really amazing,” said Harry heavily as they set

off toward the steps into the entrance hall. “What do

they want photos for, Colin?”

“The Daily Prophet, I think!”

“Great,” said Harry dully. “Exactly what I need. More

publicity.”

“Good luck!” said Colin when they had reached the

right room. Harry knocked on the door and entered.

He was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks

had been pushed away to the back of the room,

 

leaving a large space in the middle; three of them,

however, had been placed end-to-end in front of the

blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet.

Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered

desks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them,

talking to a witch Harry had never seen before, who

was wearing magenta robes.

Viktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as

usual and not talking to anybody. Cedric and Fleur

were in conversation. Fleur looked a good deal

happier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept

throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair

caught the light. A paunchy man, holding a large

black camera that was smoking slightly, was

watching Fleur out of the corner of his eye.

Bagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and

bounded forward.

“Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come,

Harry, in you come ... nothing to worry about, it’s just

the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges

will be here in a moment — ”

“Wand weighing?” Harry repeated nervously.

“We have to check that your wands are fully

functional, no problems, you know, as they’re your

most important tools in the tasks ahead,” said

Bagman. “The expert’s upstairs now with

Dumbledore. And then there’s going to be a little

photo shoot. This is Rita Skeeter,” he added,

gesturing toward the witch in magenta robes. “She’s

doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily

Prophet ...”

“Maybe not that small, Ludo,” said Rita Skeeter, her

eyes on Harry.

 

Her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls

that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face. She

wore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching

her crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails,

painted crimson.

“I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry

before we start?” she said to Bagman, but still gazing

fixedly at Harry. “The youngest champion, you know

... to add a bit of color?”

“Certainly!” cried Bagman. “That is — if Harry has no

objection?”

“Er — ” said Harry.

“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her

scarlet-taloned fingers had Harry’s upper arm in a

surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him

out of the room again and opening a nearby door.

“We don’t want to be in there with all that noise,” she

said. “Let’s see ... ah, yes, this is nice and cozy.”

It was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her.

“Come along, dear — that’s right — lovely,” said Rita

Skeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an

upturned bucket, pushing Harry down onto a

cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them

into darkness. “Let’s see now ...”

She unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and

pulled out a handful of candles, which she lit with a

wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that

they could see what they were doing.

“You won’t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes

Quill? It leaves me free to talk to you normally. ...”

 

“A what?” said Harry.

Rita Skeeter’s smile widened. Harry counted three

gold teeth. She reached again into her crocodile bag

and drew out a long acid-green quill and a roll of

parchment, which she stretched out between them on

a crate of Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess

Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her

mouth, sucked it for a moment with apparent relish,

then placed it upright on the parchment, where it

stood balanced on its point, quivering slightly.

“Testing ... my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet

reporter.”

Harry looked down quickly at the quill. The moment

Rita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started

to scribble, skidding across the parchment:

Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, whose

savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations

“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped

the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and

stuffed it into her handbag. Now she leaned toward

Harry and said, “So, Harry ... what made you decide

to enter the Triwizard Tournament?”

“Er — ” said Harry again, but he was distracted by the

quill. Even though he wasn’t speaking, it was dashing

across the parchment, and in its wake he could make

out a fresh sentence:

An ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the

otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Ignore the quill, Harry,” said Rita Skeeter firmly.

Reluctantly, Harry looked up at her instead. “Now —

why did you decide to enter the tournament, Harry?”

“I didn’t,” said Harry. “I don’t know how my name got

into the Goblet of Fire. I didn’t put it in there.”

Rita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow.

“Come now, Harry, there’s no need to be scared of

getting into trouble. We all know you shouldn’t really

have entered at all. But don’t worry about that. Our

readers love a rebel.”

“But I didn’t enter,” Harry repeated. “I don’t know

who — ”

“How do you feel about the tasks ahead?” said Rita

Skeeter. “Excited? Nervous?”

“I haven’t really thought ... yeah, nervous, I suppose,”

said Harry. His insides squirmed uncomfortably as he

spoke.

“Champions have died in the past, haven’t they?” said

Rita Skeeter briskly. “Have you thought about that at

all?”

“Well ... they say it’s going to be a lot safer this year,”

said Harry.

The quill whizzed across the parchment between

them, back and forward as though it were skating.

“Of course, you’ve looked death in the face before,

haven’t you?” said Rita Skeeter, watching him closely.

“How would you say that’s affected you?”

“Er,” said Harry, yet again.

 

“Do you think that the trauma in your past might

have made you keen to prove yourself? To live up to

your name? Do you think that perhaps you were

tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because

“I didn’t enter,” said Harry, starting to feel irritated.

“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita

Skeeter, talking over him.

“No,” said Harry.

“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were

competing in the Triwizard Tournament? Proud?

Worried? Angry?”

Harry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth

was he to know how his parents would feel if they

were alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching him

very intently. Frowning, he avoided her gaze and

looked down at words the quill had just written:

Tears fill those startling green eyes as our

conversation turns to the parents he can barely

remember.

“I have NOT got tears in my eyes!” said Harry loudly.

Before Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the

broom cupboard was pulled open. Harry looked

around, blinking in the bright light. Albus

Dumbledore stood there, looking down at both of

them, squashed into the cupboard.

“ Dumbledorel” cried Rita Skeeter, with every

appearance of delight — but Harry noticed that her

quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from

the box of Magical Mess Remover, and Rita’s clawed

 

fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her

crocodile-skin bag. “How are you?” she said, standing

up and holding out one of her large, mannish hands

to Dumbledore. “I hope you saw my piece over the

summer about the International Confederation of

Wizards’ Conference?”

“Enchantingly nasty,” said Dumbledore, his eyes

twinkling. “I particularly enjoyed your description of

me as an obsolete dingbat.”

Rita Skeeter didn’t look remotely abashed.

“I was just making the point that some of your ideas

are a little old-fashioned, Dumbledore, and that many

wizards in the street — ”

“I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the

rudeness, Rita,” said Dumbledore, with a courteous

bow and a smile, “but I’m afraid we will have to

discuss the matter later. The Weighing of the Wands

is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our

champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.”

Very glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry

hurried back into the room. The other champions

were now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat

down quickly next to Cedric, looking up at the velvet-

covered table, where four of the five judges were now

sitting — Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr.

Crouch, and Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled

herself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip the

parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her

knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and

place it once more on the parchment.

“May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?” said Dumbledore,

taking his place at the judges’ table and talking to the

champions. “He will be checking your wands to

 

ensure that they are in good condition before the

tournament.”

Harry looked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw

an old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by

the window. Harry had met Mr. Ollivander before —

he was the wand-maker from whom Harry had

bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon

Alley.

“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first,

please?” said Mr. Ollivander, stepping into the empty

space in the middle of the room.

Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Ollivander and

handed him her wand.

“Hmmm ...” he said.

He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a

baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold

sparks. Then he held it close to his eyes and

examined it carefully.

“Yes,” he said quietly, “nine and a half inches ...

inflexible . . . rosewood . . . and containing . . . dear me

“An ’air from ze ’ead of a veela,” said Fleur. “One of

my grandmuzzer’s.”

So Fleur was part veela, thought Harry, making a

mental note to tell Ron . . . then he remembered that

Ron wasn’t speaking to him.

“Yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, “yes, I’ve never used veela

hair myself, of course. I find it makes for rather

temperamental wands . . . however, to each his own,

and if this suits you ...”

 

Mr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand,

apparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he

muttered, “ OrchideousV’ and a bunch of flowers burst

from the wand tip.

“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said

Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing

them to Fleur with her wand. “Mr. Diggory, you next.”

Fleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he

passed her.

“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr.

Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric

handed over his wand. “Yes, I remember it well.

Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly

fine male unicorn . . . must have been seventeen

hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked

his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches ... ash ...

pleasantly springy. It’s in fine condition. ... You treat

it regularly?”

“Polished it last night,” said Cedric, grinning.

Harry looked down at his own wand. He could see

finger marks all over it. He gathered a fistful of robe

from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously.

Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur

Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he

desisted.

Mr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings

across the room from the tip of Cedric’s wand,

pronounced himself satisfied, and then said, “Mr.

Krum, if you please.”

Viktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered

and duck-footed, toward Mr. Ollivander. He thrust

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

out his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in

the pockets of his robes.

“Hmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, “this is a Gregorovitch

creation, unless I’m much mistaken? A fine wand-

maker, though the styling is never quite what I . . .

however ...”

He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning

it over and over before his eyes.

“Yes . . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” he shot at

Krum, who nodded. “Rather thicker than one usually

sees . . . quite rigid . . . ten and a quarter inches . . .

Avis'.”

The hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a

number of small, twittering birds flew out of the end

and through the open window into the watery

sunlight.

“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his

wand. “Which leaves ... Mr. Potter.”

Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr.

Ollivander. He handed over his wand.

“Aaaah, yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, his pale eyes

suddenly gleaming. “Yes, yes, yes. How well I

remember.”

Harry could remember too. He could remember it as

though it had happened yesterday. . .

Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had

entered Mr. Ollivander’s shop with Hagrid to buy a

wand. Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements

and then started handing him wands to try. Harry

had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until

 

at last he had found the one that suited him — this

one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and

contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix.

Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry

had been so compatible with this wand. “Curious,” he

had said, “curious,” and not until Harry asked what

was curious had Mr. Ollivander explained that the

phoenix feather in Harry’s wand had come from the

same bird that had supplied the core of Lord

Voldemort’s.

Harry had never shared this piece of information with

anybody. He was very fond of his wand, and as far as

he was concerned its relation to Voldemort’s wand

was something it couldn’t help — rather as he

couldn’t help being related to Aunt Petunia. However,

he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn’t about to

tell the room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita

Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with

excitement if he did.

Mr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry’s

wand than anyone else’s. Eventually, however, he

made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it

back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect

condition.

“Thank you all,” said Dumbledore, standing up at the

judges’ table. “You may go back to your lessons now

— or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to

dinner, as they are about to end — ”

Feeling that at last something had gone right today,

Harry got up to leave, but the man with the black

camera jumped up and cleared his throat.

“Photos, Dumbledore, photos!” cried Bagman

excitedly. “All the judges and champions, what do you

think, Rita?”

 

“Er — yes, let’s do those first,” said Rita Skeeter,

whose eyes were upon Harry again. “And then

perhaps some individual shots.”

The photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime

cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood,

and the photographer couldn’t stand far enough back

to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit

while everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept

twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra

curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would

have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half-

hidden, at the back of the group. The photographer

seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita

Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry

into greater prominence. Then she insisted on

separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were

free to go.

Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn’t there —

he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having

her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table,

then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the

extra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do.

Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron.

“You’ve had an owl,” said Ron brusquely the moment

he walked in. He was pointing at Harry’s pillow. The

school barn owl was waiting for him there.

“Oh — right,” said Harry.

“And we’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night,

Snape’s dungeon,” said Ron.

He then walked straight out of the room, not looking

at Harry. For a moment, Harry considered going after

him — he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to talk to

him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing — but

 

the lure of Sirius’s answer was too strong. Harry

strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg,

and unrolled it.

Harry —

I can’t say everything I would like to in a letter, it’s too

risky in case the owl is intercepted — we need to talk

face-to-face. Can you ensure that you are alone by the

fire in Gryffindor Tower at one o’clock in the morning

on the 22nd of November?

I know better than anyone that you can look after

yourself and while you’re around Dumbledore and

Moody I don’t think anyone will be able to hurt you.

However, someone seems to be having a good try.

Entering you in that tournament would have been very

risky, especially right under Dumbledore’ s nose.

Be on the watch, Harry. I still want to hear about

anything unusual. Let me know about the 22nd of

November as quickly as you can.

Sirius

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL

The prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all

that sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only

bright spot on a horizon that had never looked

darker. The shock of finding himself school champion

had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was

facing him had started to sink in. The first task was

drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were

crouching ahead of him like some horrific monster,

barring his path. He had never suffered nerves like

these; they were way beyond anything he had

experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his

last one against Slytherin, which had decided who

would win the Quidditch Cup. Harry was finding it

hard to think about the future at all; he felt as though

his whole life had been leading up to, and would

finish with, the first task. ...

Admittedly, he didn’t see how Sirius was going to

make him feel any better about having to perform an

unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in

front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a

friendly face would be something at the moment.

 

Harry wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be

beside the common room fire at the time Sirius had

suggested, and he and Hermione spent a long time

going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the

common room on the night in question. If the worst

came to the worst, they were going to drop a bag of

Dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn’t have to

resort to that — Filch would skin them alive.

In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry

within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had

published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament,

and it had turned out to be not so much a report on

the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry.

Much of the front page had been given over to a

picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two,

six, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names

of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions

(misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of

the article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.

The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still

got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach

every time he thought about it. Rita Skeeter had

reported him saying an awful lot of things that he

couldn’t remember ever saying in his life, let alone in

that broom cupboard.

I suppose I get my strength from my parents. I know

they’d be very proud of me if they could see me now.

... Yes, sometimes at night I still cry about them, I’m

not ashamed to admit it. ... I know nothing will hurt

me during the tournament, because they’re watching

over me. ...

But Rita Skeeter had gone even further than

transforming his “er’s” into long, sickly sentences:

She had interviewed other people about him too.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close

friend, Colin Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen

out of the company of one Hermione Granger, a

stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like Harry, is

one of the top students in the school.

From the moment the article had appeared, Harry

had had to endure people — Slytherins, mainly —

quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering

comments.

“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in

Transfiguration?”

“Since when have you been one of the top students in

the school, Potter? Or is this a school you and

Longbottom have set up together?”

“Hey — Harry!”

“Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as

he wheeled around in the corridor, having had just

about enough. “I’ve just been crying my eyes out over

my dead mum, and I’m just off to do a bit more. ...”

“No — it was just — you dropped your quill.”

It was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face.

“Oh — right — sorry,” he muttered, taking the quill

back.

“Er ... good luck on Tuesday,” she said. “I really hope

you do well.”

Which left Harry feeling extremely stupid.

Hermione had come in for her fair share of

unpleasantness too, but she hadn’t yet started yelling

 

at innocent bystanders; in fact, Harry was full of

admiration for the way she was handling the

situation.

“ Stunningly pretty? Her?” Pansy Parkinson had

shrieked the first time she had come face-to-face with

Hermione after Rita’s article had appeared. “What was

she judging against — a chipmunk?”

“Ignore it,” Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding

her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering

Slytherin girls as though she couldn’t hear them.

“Just ignore it, Harry.”

But Harry couldn’t ignore it. Ron hadn’t spoken to

him at all since he had told him about Snape’s

detentions. Harry had half hoped they would make

things up during the two hours they were forced to

pickle rats’ brains in Snape’s dungeon, but that had

been the day Rita’s article had appeared, which

seemed to have confirmed Ron’s belief that Harry was

really enjoying all the attention.

Hermione was furious with the pair of them; she went

from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to

each other, but Harry was adamant: He would talk to

Ron again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn’t put

his name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for

calling him a liar.

“I didn’t start this,” Harry said stubbornly. “It’s his

problem.”

“You miss him!” Hermione said impatiently. “And I

know he misses you — ”

“Miss him?” said Harry. “I don’t miss him. ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione

very much, but she just wasn’t the same as Ron.

There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging

around in the library when Hermione was your best

friend. Harry still hadn’t mastered Summoning

Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a

block about them, and Hermione insisted that

learning the theory would help. They consequently

spent a lot of time poring over books during their

lunchtimes.

Viktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and

Harry wondered what he was up to. Was he studying,

or was he looking for things to help him through the

first task? Hermione often complained about Krum

being there — not that he ever bothered them — but

because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy

on him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione

found the noise distracting.

“He’s not even good-looking!” she muttered angrily,

glaring at Krum’s sharp profile. “They only like him

because he’s famous! They wouldn’t look twice at him

if he couldn’t do that Wonky- Faint thing — ”

“Wronski Feint,” said Harry, through gritted teeth.

Quite apart from liking to get Quidditch terms

correct, it caused him another pang to imagine Ron’s

expression if he could have heard Hermione talking

about Wonky- Faints.

It is a strange thing, but when you are dreading

something, and would give anything to slow down

time, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up. The

days until the first task seemed to slip by as though

someone had fixed the clocks to work at double

speed. Harry’s feeling of barely controlled panic was

with him wherever he went, as everpresent as the

snide comments about the Daily Prophet article.

 

On the Saturday before the first task, all students in

the third year and above were permitted to visit the

village of Hogsmeade. Hermione told Harry that it

would do him good to get away from the castle for a

bit, and Harry didn’t need much persuasion.

“What about Ron, though?” he said. “Don’t you want

to go with him?”

“Oh ... well ...” Hermione went slightly pink. “I

thought we might meet up with him in the Three

Broomsticks. ...”

“No,” said Harry flatly.

“Oh Harry, this is so stupid — ”

“I’ll come, but I’m not meeting Ron, and I’m wearing

my Invisibility Cloak.”

“Oh all right then ...” Hermione snapped, “but I hate

talking to you in that cloak, I never know if I’m

looking at you or not.”

So Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the

dormitory, went back downstairs, and together he

and Hermione set off for Hogsmeade.

Harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak; he

watched other students walking past them as they

entered the village, most of them sporting Support

Cedric Diggory\ badges, but no horrible remarks came

his way for a change, and nobody was quoting that

stupid article.

“People keep looking at me now,” said Hermione

grumpily as they came out of Honeydukes Sweetshop

later, eating large cream-filled chocolates. “They think

I’m talking to myself.”

 

“Don’t move your lips so much then.”

“Come on, please just take off your cloak for a bit, no

one’s going to bother you here.”

“Oh yeah?” said Harry. “Look behind you.”

Rita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just

emerged from the Three Broomsticks pub. Talking in

low voices, they passed right by Hermione without

looking at her. Harry backed into the wall of

Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter from hitting him

with her crocodile-skin handbag. When they were

gone, Harry said, “She’s staying in the village. I bet

she’s coming to watch the first task.”

As he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of

molten panic. He didn’t mention this; he and

Hermione hadn’t discussed what was coming in the

first task much; he had the feeling she didn’t want to

think about it.

“She’s gone,” said Hermione, looking right through

Harry toward the end of the street. “Why don’t we go

and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks, it’s a

bit cold, isn’t it? You don’t have to talk to Ron!” she

added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence.

The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with

Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but

also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw

anywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade

was the only all-wizard village in Britain, it was a bit

of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as

adept as wizards at disguising themselves.

It was very hard to move through crowds in the

Invisibility Cloak, in case you accidentally trod on

someone, which tended to lead to awkward questions.

 

Harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner

while Hermione went to buy drinks. On his way

through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting

with Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge

to give Ron a good hard poke in the back of the head,

he finally reached the table and sat down at it.

Hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him

a butterbeer under his cloak.

“I look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own,” she

muttered. “Lucky I brought something to do.”

And she pulled out a notebook in which she had been

keeping a record of S.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his

and Ron’s names at the top of the very short list. It

seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up

those predictions together, and Hermione had turned

up and appointed them secretary and treasurer.

“You know, maybe I should try and get some of the

villagers involved in S.P.E.W.,” Hermione said

thoughtfully, looking around the pub.

“Yeah, right,” said Harry. He took a swig of butterbeer

under his cloak. “Hermione, when are you going to

give up on this spew stuff?”

“When house-elves have decent wages and working

conditions!” she hissed back. “You know, I’m starting

to think it’s time for more direct action. I wonder how

you get into the school kitchens?”

“No idea, ask Fred and George,” said Harry.

Hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry

drank his butterbeer, watching the people in the pub.

All of them looked cheerful and relaxed. Ernie

Macmillan and Hannah Abbott were swapping

 

Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby table; both of them

sporting Support Cedric Diggory\ badges on their

cloaks. Right over by the door he saw Cho and a large

group of her Ravenclaw friends. She wasn’t wearing a

Cedric badge though. ... This cheered up Harry very

slightly. ...

What wouldn’t he have given to be one of these

people, sitting around laughing and talking, with

nothing to worry about but homework? He imagined

how it would have felt to be here if his name hadn’t

come out of the Goblet of Fire. He wouldn’t be wearing

the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be

sitting with him. The three of them would probably be

happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the

school champions would be facing on Tuesday. He’d

have been really looking forward to it, watching them

do whatever it was . . . cheering on Cedric with

everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands.

He wondered how the other champions were feeling.

Every time he had seen Cedric lately, he had been

surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but

excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to

time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she

always did, haughty and unruffled. And Krum just

sat in the library, poring over books.

Harry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in

his chest seemed to ease slightly. He would be

speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight

was the night they were meeting at the common room

fire — assuming nothing went wrong, as everything

else had done lately. ...

“Look, it’s Hagrid!” said Hermione.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

The back of Hagrid ’s enormous shaggy head — he

had mercifully abandoned his bunches — emerged

over the crowd. Harry wondered why he hadn’t

spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so large, but

standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been

leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had

his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but

Moody was drinking from his hip flask. Madam

Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn’t seem to think

much of this; she was looking askance at Moody as

she collected glasses from tables around them.

Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled

mead, but Harry knew better. Moody had told them

all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts

lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and

drink at all times, as it was so easy for Dark wizards

to poison an unattended cup.

As Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up

to leave. He waved, then remembered that Hagrid

couldn’t see him. Moody, however, paused, his

magical eye on the corner where Harry was standing.

He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being

unable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to

him, and then the pair of them made their way back

across the pub toward Harry and Hermione’s table.

“All right, Hermione?” said Hagrid loudly.

“Hello,” said Hermione, smiling back.

Moody limped around the table and bent down; Harry

thought he was reading the S.P.E.W. notebook, until

he muttered, “Nice cloak, Potter.”

Harry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk

missing from Moody’s nose was particularly obvious

at a few inches’ distance. Moody grinned.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Can your eye — I mean, can you — ?”

“Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,” Moody

said quietly. “And it’s come in useful at times, I can

tell you.”

Hagrid was beaming down at Harry too. Harry knew

Hagrid couldn’t see him, but Moody had obviously

told Hagrid he was there. Hagrid now bent down on

the pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well,

and said in a whisper so low that only Harry could

hear it, “Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me

cabin. Wear that cloak.”

Straightening up, Hagrid said loudly, “Nice ter see

yeh, Hermione,” winked, and departed. Moody

followed him.

“Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?”

Harry said, very surprised.

“Does he?” said Hermione, looking startled. “I wonder

what he’s up to? I don’t know whether you should go,

Harry. ...” She looked nervously around and hissed,

“It might make you late for Sirius.”

It was true that going down to Hagrid ’s at midnight

would mean cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine

indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down to

Hagrid ’s to tell him he couldn’t go — always assuming

she would consent to take the note, of course —

Harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at

whatever Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious

to know what this might be; Hagrid had never asked

Harry to visit him so late at night.

At half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had

pretended to go up to bed early, pulled the Invisibility

Cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs

 

through the common room. Quite a few people were

still in there. The Creevey brothers had managed to

get hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggoryl badges

and were trying to bewitch them to make them say

Support Harry Potter\ instead. So far, however, all they

had managed to do was get the badges stuck on

POTTER STINKS. Harry crept past them to the portrait

hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on

his watch. Then Hermione opened the Fat Lady for

him from outside as they had planned. He slipped

past her with a whispered “Thanks!” and set off

through the castle.

The grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the

lawn toward the lights shining in Hagrid’s cabin. The

inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was

also lit up; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking

inside it as he knocked on Hagrid’s front door.

“You there, Harry?” Hagrid whispered, opening the

door and looking around.

“Yeah,” said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and

pulling the cloak down off his head. “What’s up?”

“Got summat ter show yeh,” said Hagrid.

There was an air of enormous excitement about

Hagrid. He was wearing a flower that resembled an

oversized artichoke in his buttonhole. It looked as

though he had abandoned the use of axle grease, but

he had certainly attempted to comb his hair — Harry

could see the comb’s broken teeth tangled in it.

“What’re you showing me?” Harry said warily,

wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or Hagrid had

managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a

stranger in a pub.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Come with me, keep quiet, an’ keep yerself covered

with that cloak,” said Hagrid. “We won’ take Fang, he

won’ like it. ...”

“Listen, Hagrid, I can’t stay long. ... I’ve got to be back

up at the castle by one o’clock — ”

But Hagrid wasn’t listening; he was opening the cabin

door and striding off into the night. Harry hurried to

follow and found, to his great surprise, that Hagrid

was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.

“Hagrid, what — ?”

“Shhh!” said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on

the door bearing the crossed golden wands.

Madame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk

shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders. She

smiled when she saw Hagrid.

“Ah, ’Agrid ... it is time?”

“Bong-sewer,” said Hagrid, beaming at her, and

holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps.

Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid

offered her his arm, and they set off around the edge

of the paddock containing Madame Maxime ’s giant

winged horses, with Harry, totally bewildered,

running to keep up with them. Had Hagrid wanted to

show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old

time he wanted ... she wasn’t exactly hard to miss. ...

But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the

same treat as Harry, because after a while she said

playfully, “Wair is it you are taking me, ’Agrid?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said Hagrid gruffly, “worth seem’,

trust me. On’y — don’ go tellin’ anyone I showed yeh,

right? Yeh’re not s’posed ter know.”

“Of course not,” said Madame Maxime, fluttering her

long black eyelashes.

And still they walked, Harry getting more and more

irritated as he jogged along in their wake, checking

his watch every now and then. Hagrid had some

harebrained scheme in hand, which might make him

miss Sirius. If they didn’t get there soon, he was going

to turn around, go straight back to the castle, and

leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame

Maxime. ...

But then — when they had walked so far around the

perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake

were out of sight — Harry heard something. Men were

shouting up ahead . . . then came a deafening,

earsplitting roar. . . .

Hagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees

and came to a halt. Harry hurried up alongside them

— for a split second, he thought he was seeing

bonfires, and men darting around them — and then

his mouth fell open.

Dragons.

Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons

were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure

fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and

snorting — torrents of fire were shooting into the dark

sky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above

the ground on their outstretched necks. There was a

silvery-blue one with long, pointed horns, snapping

and snarling at the wizards on the ground; a smooth-

scaled green one, which was writhing and stamping

 

with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine

gold spikes around its face, which was shooting

mushroom-shaped fire clouds into the air; and a

gigantic black one, more lizard-like than the others,

which was nearest to them.

At least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon,

were attempting to control them, pulling on the

chains connected to heavy leather straps around their

necks and legs. Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high

above him, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with

vertical pupils like a cat’s, bulging with either fear or

rage, he couldn’t tell which. ... It was making a

horrible noise, a yowling, screeching scream. ...

“Keep back there, Hagrid!” yelled a wizard near the

fence, straining on the chain he was holding. “They

can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you know! I’ve

seen this Horntail do forty!”

“Is’n’ it beautiful?” said Hagrid softly.

“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard. “Stunning

Spells, on the count of three!”

Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his

wand.

“Stupefy\” they shouted in unison, and the Stunning

Spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets,

bursting in showers of stars on the dragons’ scaly

hides —

Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter

dangerously on its back legs; its jaws stretched wide

in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of

flame, though still smoking — then, very slowly, it

fell. Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn

made the trees behind him quake.

The dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked

forward to their fallen charges, each of which was the

size of a small hill. They hurried to tighten the chains

and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they

forced deep into the ground with their wands.

“Wan’ a closer look?” Hagrid asked Madame Maxime

excitedly. The pair of them moved right up to the

fence, and Harry followed. The wizard who had

warned Hagrid not to come any closer turned, and

Harry realized who it was: Charlie Weasley.

“All right, Hagrid?” he panted, coming over to talk.

“They should be okay now — we put them out with a

Sleeping Draft on the way here, thought it might be

better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet

— but, like you saw, they weren’t happy, not happy at

all — ”

“What breeds you got here, Charlie?” said Hagrid,

gazing at the closest dragon, the black one, with

something close to reverence. Its eyes were still just

open. Harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow

beneath its wrinkled black eyelid.

“This is a Hungarian Horntail,” said Charlie. “There’s

a Common Welsh Green over there, the smaller one —

a Swedish Short-Snout, that blue-gray — and a

Chinese Fireball, that’s the red.”

Charlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling

away around the edge of the enclosure, gazing at the

stunned dragons.

“I didn’t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,” Charlie

said, frowning. “The champions aren’t supposed to

 

know what’s coming — she’s bound to tell her

student, isn’t she?”

“Jus’ thought she’d like ter see ’em,” shrugged Hagrid,

still gazing, enraptured, at the dragons.

“Really romantic date, Hagrid,” said Charlie, shaking

his head.

“Four ...” said Hagrid, “so it’s one fer each o’ the

champions, is it? What’ve they gotta do — fight ’em?”

“Just get past them, I think,” said Charlie. “We’ll be

on hand if it gets nasty, Extinguishing Spells at the

ready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don’t know

why ... but I tell you this, I don’t envy the one who

gets the Horntail. Vicious thing. Its back end’s as

dangerous as its front, look.”

Charlie pointed toward the Horntail’s tail, and Harry

saw long, bronze-colored spikes protruding along it

every few inches.

Five of Charlie’s fellow keepers staggered up to the

Horntail at that moment, carrying a clutch of huge

granite-gray eggs between them in a blanket. They

placed them carefully at the Horntail’s side. Hagrid let

out a moan of longing.

“I’ve got them counted, Hagrid,” said Charlie sternly.

Then he said, “How’s Harry?”

“Fine,” said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.

“Just hope he’s still fine after he’s faced this lot,” said

Charlie grimly, looking out over the dragons’

enclosure. “I didn’t dare tell Mum what he’s got to do

for the first task; she’s already having kittens about

him. ...” Charlie imitated his mother’s anxious voice. “

 

‘ How could they let him enter that tournament, he’s

much too young\ I thought they were all safe, I thought

there was going to he an age limiti ’ She was in floods

after that Daily Prophet article about him. ‘He still

cries about his parents\ Oh bless him, I never knew\ ’ ”

Harry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that

Hagrid wouldn’t miss him, with the attractions of four

dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he

turned silently and began to walk away, back to the

castle.

He didn’t know whether he was glad he’d seen what

was coming or not. Perhaps this way was better. The

first shock was over now. Maybe if he’d seen the

dragons for the first time on Tuesday, he would have

passed out cold in front of the whole school ... but

maybe he would anyway. ... He was going to be armed

with his wand — which, just now, felt like nothing

more than a narrow strip of wood — against a fifty-

foot-high, scaly, spike-ridden, fire-breathing dragon.

And he had to get past it. With everyone watching.

How?

Harry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had

just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside

and talk to Sirius, and he couldn’t remember, ever,

wanting to talk to someone more than he did right

now — when, without warning, he ran into something

very solid.

Harry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the

cloak around him. A voice nearby said, “Ouch! Who’s

there?”

Harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering

him and lay very still, staring up at the dark outline

of the wizard he had hit. He recognized the goatee ...

it was Karkaroff.

 

“Who’s there?” said Karkaroff again, very

suspiciously, looking around in the darkness. Harry

remained still and silent. After a minute or so,

Karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort

of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as

though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back

under the cover of the trees and started to edge

forward toward the place where the dragons were.

Very slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet

and set off again as fast as he could without making

too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back

toward Hogwarts.

He had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up

to. He had sneaked off his ship to try and find out

what the first task was going to be. He might even

have spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off

around the forest together — they were hardly

difficult to spot at a distance . . . and now all Karkaroff

had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like

Madame Maxime, would know what was in store for

the champions.

By the looks of it, the only champion who would be

facing the unknown on Tuesday was Cedric.

Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front

doors, and began to climb the marble stairs; he was

very out of breath, but he didn’t dare slow down. ...

He had less than five minutes to get up to the fire. ...

“Balderdash!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was

snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole.

“If you say so,” she muttered sleepily, without opening

her eyes, and the picture swung forward to admit

him. Harry climbed inside. The common room was

deserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite

 

normal, Hermione had not needed to set off any

Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy.

Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw

himself into an armchair in front of the fire. The room

was in semidarkness; the flames were the only source

of light. Nearby, on a table, the Support Cedric

Diggoryl badges the Creeveys had been trying to

improve were glinting in the firelight. They now read

POTTER REALLY STINKS. Harry looked back into the

flames, and jumped.

Sirius’s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn’t

seen Mr. Diggory do exactly this back in the Weasleys’

kitchen, it would have scared him out of his wits.

Instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had

worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair,

crouched down by the hearth, and said, “Sirius —

how ’re you doing?”

Sirius looked different from Harry’s memory of him.

When they had said good-bye, Sirius’s face had been

gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long,

black, matted hair — but the hair was short and

clean now, Sirius’s face was fuller, and he looked

younger, much more like the only photograph Harry

had of him, which had been taken at the Potters’

wedding.

“Never mind me, how are you?” said Sirius seriously.

“I’m — ” For a second, Harry tried to say “fine” — but

he couldn’t do it. Before he could stop himself, he was

talking more than he’d talked in days — about how

no one believed he hadn’t entered the tournament of

his own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about him

in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn’t walk down a

corridor without being sneered at — and about Ron,

Ron not believing him, Ron’s jealousy ...

 

"... and now Hagrid’s just shown me what’s coming in

the first task, and it’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a

goner,” he finished desperately.

Sirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that

had not yet lost the look that Azkaban had given

them — that deadened, haunted look. He had let

Harry talk himself into silence without interruption,

but now he said, “Dragons we can deal with, Harry,

but we’ll get to that in a minute — I haven’t got long

here ... I’ve broken into a wizarding house to use the

fire, but they could be back at any time. There are

things I need to warn you about.”

“What?” said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further

few notches. ... Surely there could be nothing worse

than dragons coming?

“Karkaroff,” said Sirius. “Harry, he was a Death Eater.

You know what Death Eaters are, don’t you?”

“Yes — he — what?”

“He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he

got released. I’d bet everything that’s why Dumbledore

wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year — to keep an

eye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into

Azkaban in the first place.”

“Karkaroff got released?” Harry said slowly — his

brain seemed to be struggling to absorb yet another

piece of shocking information. “Why did they release

him?”

“He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,” said Sirius

bitterly. “He said he’d seen the error of his ways, and

then he named names ... he put a load of other people

into Azkaban in his place. ... He’s not very popular in

there, I can tell you. And since he got out, from what I

 

can tell, he’s been teaching the Dark Arts to every

student who passes through that school of his. So

watch out for the Durmstrang champion as well.”

“Okay,” said Harry slowly. “But ... are you saying

Karkaroff put my name in the goblet? Because if he

did, he’s a really good actor. He seemed furious about

it. He wanted to stop me from competing.”

“We know he’s a good actor,” said Sirius, “because he

convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn’t

he? Now, I’ve been keeping an eye on the Daily

Prophet, Harry — ”

“ — you and the rest of the world,” said Harry bitterly.

“ — and reading between the lines of that Skeeter

woman’s article last month, Moody was attacked the

night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she

says it was another false alarm,” Sirius said hastily,

seeing Harry about to speak, “but I don’t think so,

somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from

getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job

would be a lot more difficult with him around. And no

one’s going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye’s heard

intruders a bit too often. But that doesn’t mean he

can’t still spot the real thing. Moody was the best

Auror the Ministry ever had.”

“So . . . what are you saying?” said Harry slowly.

“Karkaroff’s trying to kill me? But — why?”

Sirius hesitated.

“I’ve been hearing some very strange things,” he said

slowly. “The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active

than usual lately. They showed themselves at the

Quidditch World Cup, didn’t they? Someone set off

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

the Dark Mark . . . and then — did you hear about that

Ministry of Magic witch who’s gone missing?”

“Bertha Jorkins?” said Harry.

“Exactly ... she disappeared in Albania, and that’s

definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last ...

and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament

was coming up, wouldn’t she?”

“Yeah, but ... it’s not very likely she’d have walked

straight into Voldemort, is it?” said Harry.

“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly.

“She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above

your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very nosy,

but no brains, none at all. It’s not a good

combination, Harry. I’d say she’d be very easy to lure

into a trap.

“So ... so Voldemort could have found out about the

tournament?” said Harry. “Is that what you mean?

You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders?”

“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know

... Karkaroff doesn’t strike me as the type who’d go

back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was

powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put

your name in that goblet did it for a reason, and I

can’t help thinking the tournament would be a very

good way to attack you and make it look like an

accident.”

“Looks like a really good plan from where I’m

standing,” said Harry grinning bleakly. “They’ll just

have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff.”

“Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very

quickly now. “There’s a way, Harry. Don’t be tempted

 

to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong and too

powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single

Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a

time to overcome a dragon — ”

“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry.

“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is a way,

and a simple spell’s all you need. Just — ”

But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart

suddenly pounding as though it would burst. He

could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase

behind him.

“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “Go! There’s someone

coming!”

Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if

someone saw Sirius’s face within the walls of

Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar — the

Ministry would get dragged in — he, Harry, would be

questioned about Sirius’s whereabouts —

Harry heard a tiny pop\ in the fire behind him and

knew Sirius had gone. He watched the bottom of the

spiral staircase. Who had decided to go for a stroll at

one o’clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from

telling him how to get past a dragon?

It was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas,

Ron stopped dead facing Harry across the room, and

looked around.

“Who were you talking to?” he said.

“What’s that got to do with you?” Harry snarled.

“What are you doing down here at this time of night?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I just wondered where you — ” Ron broke off,

shrugging. “Nothing. I’m going back to bed.”

“Just thought you’d come nosing around, did you?”

Harry shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what

he’d walked in on, knew he hadn’t done it on purpose,

but he didn’t care — at this moment he hated

everything about Ron, right down to the several

inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama

trousers.

“Sorry about that,” said Ron, his face reddening with

anger. “Should’ve realized you didn’t want to be

disturbed. I’ll let you get on with practicing for your

next interview in peace.”

Harry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS

badges off the table and chucked it, as hard as he

could, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead

and bounced off.

“There you go,” Harry said. “Something for you to

wear on Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if

you’re lucky. ... That’s what you want, isn’t it?”

He strode across the room toward the stairs; he half

expected Ron to stop him, he would even have liked

Ron to throw a punch at him, but Ron just stood

there in his too-small pajamas, and Harry, having

stormed upstairs, lay awake in bed fuming for a long

time afterward and didn’t hear him come up to bed.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE FIRST TASK

Harry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so

inattentively that it was a while before he realized he

was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his

sock. When he’d finally got all his clothes on the right

parts of his body, he hurried off to find Hermione,

locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall,

where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling

too queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had

swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged

her out onto the grounds. There, he told her all about

the dragons, and about everything Sirius had said,

while they took another long walk around the lake.

Alarmed as she was by Sirius’s warnings about

Karkaroff, Hermione still thought that the dragons

were the more pressing problem.

“Let’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday

evening,” she said desperately, “and then we can

worry about Karkaroff.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

They walked three times around the lake, trying all

the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue

a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so

they retired to the library instead. Here, Harry pulled

down every book he could find on dragons, and both

of them set to work searching through the large pile.

“ ‘Talon-clipping by charms ... treating scale-rot ...’

This is no good, this is for nutters like Hagrid who

want to keep them healthy. ...”

“ ‘Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the

ancient magic that imbues their thick hides, which

none but the most powerful spells can penetrate ...’

But Sirius said a simple one would do it. ...”

“Let’s try some simple spellbooks, then,” said Harry,

throwing aside Men Who Love Dragons Too Much.

He returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set

them down, and began to flick through each in turn,

Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow.

“Well, there are Switching Spells ... but what’s the

point of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs

for wine-gums or something that would make it less

dangerous. ... The trouble is, like that book said, not

much is going to get through a dragon’s hide. ... I’d

say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really

haven’t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall

... unless you’re supposed to put the spell on

yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But

they’re not simple spells, I mean, we haven’t done any

of those in class, I only know about them because I’ve

been doing O.W.L. practice papers. ...”

“Hermione,” Harry said, through gritted teeth, “will

you shut up for a bit, please? I’m trying to

concentrate.”

 

But all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was

that Harry’s brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing,

which didn’t seem to allow room for concentration. He

stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for

the Busy and Vexed. Instant scalping . . . but dragons

had no hair . . . pepper breath . . . that would probably

increase a dragon’s firepower ... horn tongue ... just

what he needed, to give it an extra weapon . . .

“Oh no, he’s back again, why can’t he read on his

stupid ship?” said Hermione irritably as Viktor Krum

slouched in, cast a surly look over at the pair of them,

and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of

books. “Come on, Harry, we’ll go back to the common

room ... his fan club’ll be here in a moment, twittering

away. ...”

And sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of

girls tiptoed past them, one of them wearing a

Bulgaria scarf tied around her waist.

Harry barely slept that night. When he awoke on

Monday morning, he seriously considered for the first

time ever just running away from Hogwarts. But as

he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time,

and thought about what leaving the castle would

mean, he knew he couldn’t do it. It was the only place

he had ever been happy . . . well, he supposed he must

have been happy with his parents too, but he couldn’t

remember that.

Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be

here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive

with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel

slightly calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty

(his throat wasn’t working too well), and as he and

Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the

Hufflepuff table.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Cedric still didn’t know about the dragons ... the only

champion who didn’t, if Harry was right in thinking

that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and

Krum. ...

“Hermione, I’ll see you in the greenhouses,” Harry

said, coming to his decision as he watched Cedric

leaving the Hall. “Go on, I’ll catch you up.”

“Harry, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring — ”

“I’ll catch you up, okay?”

By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble

staircase, Cedric was at the top. He was with a load of

sixth-year friends. Harry didn’t want to talk to Cedric

in front of them; they were among those who had

been quoting Rita Skeeter’s article at him every time

he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance

and saw that he was heading toward the Charms

corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a

distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took

careful aim.

“Diffindol”

Cedric’s bag split. Parchment, quills, and books

spilled out of it onto the floor. Several bottles of ink

smashed.

“Don’t bother,” said Cedric in an exasperated voice as

his friends bent down to help him. “Tell Flitwick I’m

coming, go on. ...”

This was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He

slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until

Cedric’s friends had disappeared into their classroom,

and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of

everyone but himself and Cedric.

 

“Hi,” said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to

Advanced Transfiguration that was now splattered

with ink. “My bag just split ... brand-new and all ...”

“Cedric,” said Harry, “the first task is dragons.”

“What?” said Cedric, looking up.

“Dragons,” said Harry, speaking quickly, in case

Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had

got to. “They’ve got four, one for each of us, and we’ve

got to get past them.”

Cedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic

he’d been feeling since Saturday night flickering in

Cedric’s gray eyes.

“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice.

“Dead sure,” said Harry. “I’ve seen them.”

“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to

know. ...”

“Never mind,” said Harry quickly — he knew Hagrid

would be in trouble if he told the truth. “But I’m not

the only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will know

by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the

dragons too.”

Cedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills,

parchment, and books, his ripped bag dangling off

one shoulder. He stared at Harry, and there was a

puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes.

“Why are you telling me?” he asked.

Harry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric

wouldn’t have asked that if he had seen the dragons

 

himself. Harry wouldn’t have let his worst enemy face

those monsters unprepared — well, perhaps Malfoy or

Snape ...

“It’s just ... fair, isn’t it?” he said to Cedric. “We all

know now ... we’re on an even footing, aren’t we?”

Cedric was still looking at him in a slightly suspicious

way when Harry heard a familiar clunking noise

behind him. He turned around and saw Mad-Eye

Moody emerging from a nearby classroom.

“Come with me, Potter,” he growled. “Diggory, off you

go.”

Harry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he

overheard them?

“Er — Professor, I’m supposed to be in Herbology — ”

“Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please. ...”

Harry followed him, wondering what was going to

happen to him now. What if Moody wanted to know

how he’d found out about the dragons? Would Moody

go to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn

Harry into a ferret? Well, it might be easier to get past

a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he’d

be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty

feet ...

He followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the

door behind them and turned to look at Harry, his

magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one.

“That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,”

Moody said quietly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the

reaction he had expected at all.

“Sit down,” said Moody, and Harry sat, looking

around.

He had visited this office under two of its previous

occupants. In Professor Lockhart’s day, the walls had

been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of

Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived

here, you were more likely to come across a specimen

of some fascinating new Dark creature he had

procured for them to study in class. Now, however,

the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd

objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the

days when he had been an Auror.

On his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked,

glass spinning top; Harry recognized it at once as a

Sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though

it was much smaller than Moody’s. In the corner on a

small table stood an object that looked something like

an extra- squiggly, golden television aerial. It was

humming slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung

opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting

the room. Shadowy figures were moving around

inside it, none of them clearly in focus.

“Like my Dark Detectors, do you?” said Moody, who

was watching Harry closely.

“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly

golden aerial.

“Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects

concealment and lies ... no use here, of course, too

much interference — students in every direction lying

about why they haven’t done their homework. Been

humming ever since I got here. I had to disable my

 

Sneakoscope because it wouldn’t stop whistling. It’s

extra-sensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around. Of

course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff,” he

added in a growl.

“And what’s the mirror for?”

“Oh that’s my Foe-Glass. See them out there,

skulking around? I’m not really in trouble until I see

the whites of their eyes. That’s when I open my

trunk.”

He let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the

large trunk under the window. It had seven keyholes

in a row. Harry wondered what was in there, until

Moody’s next question brought him sharply back to

earth.

“So ... found out about the dragons, have you?”

Harry hesitated. He’d been afraid of this — but he

hadn’t told Cedric, and he certainly wasn’t going to

tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.

“It’s all right,” said Moody, sitting down and

stretching out his wooden leg with a groan.

“Cheating’s a traditional part of the Tri-wizard

Tournament and always has been.”

“I didn’t cheat,” said Harry sharply. “It was — a sort

of accident that I found out.”

Moody grinned. “I wasn’t accusing you, laddie. I’ve

been telling Dumbledore from the start, he can be as

high-minded as he likes, but you can bet old

Karkaroff and Maxime won’t be. They’ll have told their

champions everything they can. They want to win.

They want to beat Dumbledore. They’d like to prove

he’s only human.”

 

Moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye

swiveled around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to

watch it.

“So ... got any ideas how you’re going to get past your

dragon yet?” said Moody.

“No,” said Harry.

“Well, I’m not going to tell you,” said Moody gruffly. “I

don’t show favoritism, me. I’m just going to give you

some good, general advice. And the first bit is — play

to your strengths.”

“I haven’t got any,” said Harry, before he could stop

himself.

“Excuse me,” growled Moody, “you’ve got strengths if I

say you’ve got them. Think now. What are you best

at?”

Harry tried to concentrate. What was he best at?

Well, that was easy, really —

“Quidditch,” he said dully, “and a fat lot of help — ”

“That’s right,” said Moody, staring at him very hard,

his magical eye barely moving at all. “You’re a damn

good flier from what I’ve heard.”

“Yeah, but ...” Harry stared at him. “I’m not allowed a

broom, I’ve only got my wand — ”

“My second piece of general advice,” said Moody

loudly, interrupting him, “is to use a nice, simple

spell that will enable you to get what you need.”

Harry looked at him blankly. What did he need?

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Come on, boy ...” whispered Moody. “Put them

together ... it’s not that difficult. ...”

And it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to

pass the dragon in the air. For that, he needed his

Firebolt. And for his Firebolt, he needed —

“Hermione,” Harry whispered, when he had sped into

greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried

apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her.

“Hermione — I need you to help me.”

“What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?” she

whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the

top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.

“Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning

Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon.”

And so they practiced. They didn’t have lunch, but

headed for a free classroom, where Harry tried with

all his might to make various objects fly across the

room toward him. He was still having problems. The

books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the

room and dropping like stones to the floor.

“Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. ...”

“What d’you think I’m trying to do?” said Harry

angrily. “A great big dragon keeps popping up in my

head for some reason. ... Okay, try again. ...”

He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but

Hermione refused point-blank to skive off

Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying

without her. He therefore had to endure over an hour

of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson

telling everyone that the position of Mars with relation

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

to Saturn at that moment meant that people born in

July were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths.

“Well, that’s good,” said Harry loudly, his temper

getting the better of him, “just as long as it’s not

drawn-out. I don’t want to suffer.”

Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to

laugh; he certainly caught Harry’s eye for the first

time in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful

toward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the lesson

trying to attract small objects toward him under the

table with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom

straight into his hand, though he wasn’t entirely sure

that was his prowess at Summoning Charms —

perhaps the fly was just stupid.

He forced down some dinner after Divination, then

returned to the empty classroom with Hermione,

using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers.

They kept practicing until past midnight. They would

have stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and,

pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown

at him, started chucking chairs across the room.

Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise

attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor

common room, which was now mercifully empty.

At two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the

fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books,

quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of

Gobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in the last

hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning

Charm.

“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione

said, looking exhausted but very pleased.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t

manage a spell,” Harry said, throwing a rune

dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again,

“threaten me with a dragon. Right ...” He raised his

wand once more. “Accio Dictionary !”

The heavy book soared out of Hermione ’s hand, flew

across the room, and Harry caught it.

“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione

delightedly.

“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The

Firebolt’s going to be much farther away than the

stuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m

going to be out there on the grounds. ...”

“That doesn’t matter,” said Hermione firmly “Just as

long as you’re concentrating really, really hard on it,

it’ll come. Harry, we’d better get some sleep ... you’re

going to need it.”

Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the

Summoning Charm that evening that some of his

blind panic had left him. It returned in full measure,

however, on the following morning. The atmosphere

in the school was one of great tension and excitement.

Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the

students time to get down to the dragons’ enclosure

— though of course, they didn’t yet know what they

would find there.

Harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him,

whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing

“ We’ll have a box of tissues ready, Potted as he

passed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced

that he wondered whether he mightn’t just lose his

head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon,

and start trying to curse everyone in sight. Time was

 

behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever,

rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he

seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History

of Magic, and the next, walking into lunch . . . and

then (where had the morning gone? the last of the

dragon-free hours?), Professor McGonagall was

hurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of people

were watching.

“Potter, the champions have to come down onto the

grounds now. ... You have to get ready for your first

task.”

“Okay,” said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto

his plate with a clatter.

“Good luck, Harry,” Hermione whispered. “You’ll be

fine!”

“Yeah,” said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his

own.

He left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She

didn’t seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly

as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the

stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon,

she put her hand on his shoulder.

“Now, don’t panic,” she said, “just keep a cool head.

... We’ve got wizards standing by to control the

situation if it gets out of hand. ... The main thing is

just to do your best, and nobody will think any the

worse of you. ... Are you all right?”

“Yes,” Harry heard himself say. “Yes, I’m fine.”

She was leading him toward the place where the

dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when

they approached the clump of trees behind which the

 

enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a

tent had been erected, its entrance facing them,

screening the dragons from view.

“You’re to go in here with the other champions,” said

Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice,

“and wait for your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in

there ... he’ll be telling you the — the procedure. ...

Good luck.”

“Thanks,” said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left

him at the entrance of the tent. Harry went inside.

Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low

wooden stool. She didn’t look nearly as composed as

usual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Krum

looked even surlier than usual, which Harry

supposed was his way of showing nerves. Cedric was

pacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric

gave him a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling

the muscles in his face working rather hard, as

though they had forgotten how to do it.

“Harry! Good-o!” said Bagman happily, looking

around at him. “Come in, come in, make yourself at

home!”

Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown

cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced

champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again.

“Well, now we’re all here — time to fill you in!” said

Bagman brightly. “When the audience has assembled,

I’m going to be offering each of you this bag” — he

held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at

them — “from which you will each select a small

model of the thing you are about to face! There are

different — er — varieties, you see. And I have to tell

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

you something else too . . . ah, yes . . . your task is to

collect the golden egg\”

Harry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to

show that he understood Bagman’s words, and then

started pacing around the tent again; he looked

slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn’t

reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be

sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly

how Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for

this. ...

And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of

pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their

owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking. ... Harry

felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a

different species. And then — it seemed like about a

second later to Harry — Bagman was opening the

neck of the purple silk sack.

“Ladies first,” he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.

She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out

a tiny, perfect model of a dragon — a Welsh Green. It

had the number two around its neck. And Harry

knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of

surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he

had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what

was coming.

The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the

scarlet Chinese Fireball. It had a number three

around its neck. He didn’t even blink, just sat back

down and stared at the ground.

Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the

blueish-gray Swedish Short-Snout, the number one

tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry

put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the

 

Hungarian Horntail, and the number four. It

stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared

its minuscule fangs.

“Well, there you are!” said Bagman. “You have each

pulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers

refer to the order in which you are to take on the

dragons, do you see? Now, I’m going to have to leave

you in a moment, because I’m commentating. Mr.

Diggory, you’re first, just go out into the enclosure

when you hear a whistle, all right? Now ... Harry ...

could I have a quick word? Outside?”

“Er ... yes,” said Harry blankly, and he got up and

went out of the tent with Bagman, who walked him a

short distance away, into the trees, and then turned

to him with a fatherly expression on his face.

“Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?”

“What?” said Harry. “I — no, nothing.”

“Got a plan?” said Bagman, lowering his voice

conspiratorially. “Because I don’t mind sharing a few

pointers, if you’d like them, you know. I mean,”

Bagman continued, lowering his voice still further,

“you’re the underdog here, Harry. ... Anything I can

do to help ...”

“No,” said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded

rude, “no — I — I know what I’m going to do, thanks.”

“Nobody would know, Harry,” said Bagman, winking

at him.

“No, I’m fine,” said Harry, wondering why he kept

telling people this, and wondering whether he had

ever been less fine. “I’ve got a plan worked out, I — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

A whistle had blown somewhere.

“Good lord, I’ve got to run!” said Bagman in alarm,

and he hurried off.

Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric

emerging from it, greener than ever. Harry tried to

wish him luck as he walked past, but all that came

out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.

Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds

later, they heard the roar of the crowd, which meant

Cedric had entered the enclosure and was now face-

to-face with the living counterpart of his model. ...

It was worse than Harry could ever have imagined,

sitting there and listening. The crowd screamed . . .

yelled . . . gasped like a single many-headed entity, as

Cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the

Swedish Short-Snout. Krum was still staring at the

ground. Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric’s

steps, around and around the tent. And Bagman’s

commentary made everything much, much worse. ...

Horrible pictures formed in Harry’s mind as he heard:

“Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” ... “He’s

taking risks, this one!” ... “Clever move — pity it

didn’t work!”

And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard

the deafening roar that could mean only one thing:

Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the

golden egg.

“Very good indeed!” Bagman was shouting. “And now

the marks from the judges!”

But he didn’t shout out the marks; Harry supposed

the judges were holding them up and showing them

to the crowd.

 

“One down, three to go!” Bagman yelled as the whistle

blew again. “Miss Delacour, if you please!”

Fleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more

warmly toward her than he had done so far as she left

the tent with her head held high and her hand

clutching her wand. He and Krum were left alone, at

opposite sides of the tent, avoiding each other’s gaze.

The same process started again. ... “Oh I’m not sure

that was wise!” they could hear Bagman shouting

gleefully. “Oh . . . nearly! Careful now . . . good lord, I

thought she’d had it then!”

Ten minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into

applause once more. ... Fleur must have been

successful too. A pause, while Fleur’s marks were

being shown . . . more clapping . . . then, for the third

time, the whistle.

“And here comes Mr. Krum!” cried Bagman, and

Krum slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone.

He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very

aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his

fingers tingling with fear ... yet at the same time, he

seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the

tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away.

“Very daring!” Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard

the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek,

while the crowd drew its collective breath. “That’s

some nerve he’s showing — and — yes, he’s got the

egg!”

Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking

glass; Krum had finished — it would be Harry’s turn

any moment.

 

He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be

made of marshmallow. He waited. And then he heard

the whistle blow. He walked out through the entrance

of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside

him. And now he was walking past the trees, through

a gap in the enclosure fence.

He saw everything in front of him as though it was a

very highly colored dream. There were hundreds and

hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands

that had been magicked there since he’d last stood on

this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other

end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of

eggs, her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon

him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her

spiked tail, leaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard

ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise,

but whether friendly or not, Harry didn’t know or

care. It was time to do what he had to do ... to focus

his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that

was his only chance. ...

He raised his wand.

“Accio Firebolti” he shouted.

Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. ... If

it hadn’t worked ... if it wasn’t coming ... He seemed

to be looking at everything around him through some

sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat

haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of

faces around him swim strangely. ...

And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind

him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward

him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the

enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him,

waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making

even more noise. ... Bagman was shouting something

 

... but Harry’s ears were not working properly

anymore ... listening wasn’t important. ...

He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from

the ground. And a second later, something

miraculous happened. ...

As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his

hair, as the crowd’s faces became mere flesh-colored

pinpricks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size

of a dog, he realized that he had left not only the

ground behind, but also his fear. . . . He was back

where he belonged. ...

This was just another Quidditch match, that was all

... just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail

was just another ugly opposing team. ...

He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the

gold one, gleaming against its cement-colored fellows,

residing safely between the dragon’s front legs.

“Okay,” Harry told himself, “diversionary tactics ...

let’s go. ...”

He dived. The Horntail’s head followed him; he knew

what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just

in time; a jet of fire had been released exactly where

he would have been had he not swerved away . . . but

Harry didn’t care ... that was no more than dodging a

Bludger. ...

“Great Scott, he can fly!” yelled Bagman as the crowd

shrieked and gasped. “Are you watching this, Mr.

Krum?”

Harry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still

following his progress; its head revolving on its long

neck — if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy —

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

but better not push it too long, or it would be

breathing fire again —

Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its

mouth, but this time he was less lucky — he missed

the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet

him instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the

long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes —

He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and

groans from the crowd, but the cut didn’t seem to be

deep. ... Now he zoomed around the back of the

Horntail, and a possibility occurred to him. ...

The Horntail didn’t seem to want to take off, she was

too protective of her eggs. Though she writhed and

twisted, furling and unfurling her wings and keeping

those fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid

to move too far from them . . . but he had to persuade

her to do it, or he’d never get near them. ... The trick

was to do it carefully, gradually. . . .

He began to fly, first this way, then the other, not

near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off,

but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept

her eyes on him. Her head swayed this way and that,

watching him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs

bared. ...

He flew higher. The Horntail’s head rose with him, her

neck now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying,

like a snake before its charmer. . . .

Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of

exasperation. He was like a fly to her, a fly she was

longing to swat; her tail thrashed again, but he was

too high to reach now. ... She shot fire into the air,

which he dodged. ... Her jaws opened wide. ...

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Come on,” Harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above

her, “come on, come and get me ... up you get now ...”

And then she reared, spreading her great, black,

leathery wings at last, as wide as those of a small

airplane — and Harry dived. Before the dragon knew

what he had done, or where he had disappeared to,

he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he

could go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her

clawed front legs — he had taken his hands off his

Firebolt — he had seized the golden egg —

And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was

soaring out over the stands, the heavy egg safely

under his uninjured arm, and it was as though

somebody had just turned the volume back up — for

the first time, he became properly aware of the noise

of the crowd, which was screaming and applauding as

loudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup —

“Look at that!” Bagman was yelling. “Will you look at

that! Our youngest champion is quickest to get his

egg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr.

Potter!”

Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to

subdue the Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the

enclosure, Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody,

and Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving

him toward them, their smiles evident even from this

distance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of

the crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in

smoothly to land, his heart lighter than it had been in

weeks. ... He had got through the first task, he had

survived. ...

“That was excellent, Potter!” cried Professor

McGonagall as he got off the Firebolt — which from

her was extravagant praise. He noticed that her hand

 

shook as she pointed at his shoulder. “You’ll need to

see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your

score. ... Over there, she’s had to mop up Diggory

already. ...”

“Yeh did it, Harry!” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Yeh did it!

An’ agains’ the Horntail an’ all, an’ yeh know Charlie

said that was the wors’ — ”

“Thanks, Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid

wouldn’t blunder on and reveal that he had shown

Harry the dragons beforehand.

Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical

eye was dancing in its socket.

“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled.

“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please ...” said

Professor McGonagall.

Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and

saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a

second tent, looking worried.

“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling

Harry inside. The tent was divided into cubicles; he

could make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas,

but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was

sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s

shoulder, talking furiously all the while. “Last year

dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to

bring into this school next? You’re very lucky ... this

is quite shallow ... it’ll need cleaning before I heal it

up, though. ...”

She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid

that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder

with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.

 

“Now, just sit quietly for a minute — sit! And then you

can go and get your score.”

She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next

door and say, “How does it feel now, Diggory?”

Harry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of

adrenaline. He got to his feet, wanting to see what

was going on outside, but before he’d reached the

mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside

— Hermione, followed closely by Ron.

“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily.

There were fingernail marks on her face where she

had been clutching it in fear. “You were amazing! You

really were!”

But Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white

and staring at Harry as though he were a ghost.

“Harry,” he said, very seriously, “whoever put your

name in that goblet — I — I reckon they’re trying to

do you in!”

It was as though the last few weeks had never

happened — as though Harry were meeting Ron for

the first time, right after he’d been made champion.

“Caught on, have you?” said Harry coldly. “Took you

long enough.”

Hermione stood nervously between them, looking

from one to the other. Ron opened his mouth

uncertainly. Harry knew Ron was about to apologize

and suddenly he found he didn’t need to hear it.

“It’s okay,” he said, before Ron could get the words

out. “Forget it.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“No,” said Ron, “I shouldn’t’ve — ”

“ Forget it,” Harry said.

Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned

back.

Hermione burst into tears.

“There’s nothing to cry about!” Harry told her,

bewildered.

“You two are so stupid).” she shouted, stamping her

foot on the ground, tears splashing down her front.

Then, before either of them could stop her, she had

given both of them a hug and dashed away, now

positively howling.

“Barking mad,” said Ron, shaking his head. “Harry,

c’mon, they’ll be putting up your scores. ...”

Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling

more elated than he would have believed possible an

hour ago, Harry ducked out of the tent, Ron by his

side, talking fast.

“You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric

did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on

the ground . . . turned it into a dog ... he was trying to

make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well,

it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort

of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got

burned as well — the dragon changed its mind

halfway through and decided it would rather have

him than the Labrador; he only just got away. And

that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she

was trying to put it into a trance — well, that kind of

worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and

this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught

 

fire — she put it out with a bit of water out of her

wand. And Krum — you won’t believe this, but he

didn’t even think of flying! He was probably the best

after you, though. Hit it with some sort of spell right

in the eye. Only thing is, it went trampling around in

agony and squashed half the real eggs — they took

marks off for that, he wasn’t supposed to do any

damage to them.”

Ron drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of

the enclosure. Now that the Horntail had been taken

away, Harry could see where the five judges were

sitting — right at the other end, in raised seats

draped in gold.

“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” Ron said, and

Harry, squinting up the field, saw the first judge —

Madame Maxime — raise her wand in the air. What

looked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it, which

twisted itself into a large figure eight.

“Not bad!” said Ron as the crowd applauded. “I

suppose she took marks off for your shoulder. ...”

Mr. Crouch came next. He shot a number nine into

the air.

“Looking good!” Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the

back.

Next, Dumbledore. He too put up a nine. The crowd

was cheering harder than ever.

Ludo Bagman — ten.

“Ten?” said Harry in disbelief. “But ... I got hurt. ...

What’s he playing at?”

“Harry, don’t complain!” Ron yelled excitedly.

 

And now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a

moment, and then a number shot out of his wand too

— four.

“What?” Ron bellowed furiously. “Four? You lousy,

biased scumbag, you gave Krum ten!”

But Harry didn’t care, he wouldn’t have cared if

Karkaroff had given him zero; Ron’s indignation on

his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him.

He didn’t tell Ron this, of course, but his heart felt

lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure.

And it wasn’t just Ron ... those weren’t only

Gryffindors cheering in the crowd. When it had come

to it, when they had seen what he was facing, most of

the school had been on his side as well as Cedric’s. ...

He didn’t care about the Slytherins, he could stand

whatever they threw at him now.

“You’re tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!” said

Charlie Weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off

back toward the school. “Listen, I’ve got to run, I’ve

got to go and send Mum an owl, I swore I’d tell her

what happened — but that was unbelievable! Oh yeah

— and they told me to tell you you’ve got to hang

around for a few more minutes. ... Bagman wants a

word, back in the champions’ tent.”

Ron said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent,

which somehow looked quite different now: friendly

and welcoming. He thought back to how he’d felt

while dodging the Horntail, and compared it to the

long wait before he’d walked out to face it. ... There

was no comparison; the wait had been immeasurably

worse.

Fleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One

side of Cedric’s face was covered in a thick orange

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

paste, which was presumably mending his burn. He

grinned at Harry when he saw him.

“Good one, Harry.”

“And you,” said Harry, grinning back.

“Well done, all of you!” said Ludo Bagman, bouncing

into the tent and looking as pleased as though he

personally had just got past a dragon. “Now, just a

quick few words. You’ve got a nice long break before

the second task, which will take place at half past

nine on the morning of February the twenty-fourth —

but we’re giving you something to think about in the

meantime! If you look down at those golden eggs

you’re all holding, you will see that they open ... see

the hinges there? You need to solve the clue inside

the egg — because it will tell you what the second

task is, and enable you to prepare for it! All clear?

Sure? Well, off you go, then!”

Harry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to

walk back around the edge of the forest, talking hard;

Harry wanted to hear what the other champions had

done in more detail. Then, as they rounded the clump

of trees behind which Harry had first heard the

dragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them.

It was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes

today; the Quick-Quotes Quill in her hand blended

perfectly against them.

“Congratulations, Harry!” she said, beaming at him. “I

wonder if you could give me a quick word? How you

felt facing that dragon? How you feel now, about the

fairness of the scoring?”

“Yeah, you can have a word,” said Harry savagely.

“Good-bye.”

 

And he set off back to the castle with Ron.

 

THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT

Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that

evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send

Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get

past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled

Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about

Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that

Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they

entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to

have suspected it all along.

“Fits, doesn’t it?” he said. “Remember what Malfoy

said on the train, about his dad being friends with

Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew each other.

They were probably running around in masks

together at the World Cup. ... I’ll tell you one thing,

though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name

in the goblet, he’s going to be feeling really stupid

now, isn’t he? Didn’t work, did it? You only got a

scratch! Come here — I’ll do it — ”

Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery

he was flying around and around Harry’s head,

 

hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of

the air and held him still while Harry attached the

letter to his leg.

“There’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be

that dangerous, how could they be?” Ron went on as

he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. “You know

what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry,

I’m serious.”

Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up

for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he

appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however,

leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and

frowned at Ron.

“Harry’s got a long way to go before he finishes this

tournament,” she said seriously. “If that was the first

task, I hate to think what’s coming next.”

“Right little ray of sunshine, aren’t you?” said Ron.

“You and Professor Trelawney should get together

sometime.”

He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon

plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull

himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg

was much longer and heavier than usual — Harry

hadn’t been able to resist giving Sirius a blow-by-blow

account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and

dodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon

disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said,

“Well, we’d better get downstairs for your surprise

party, Harry — Fred and George should have nicked

enough food from the kitchens by now.”

Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor

common room it exploded with cheers and yells again.

There were mountains of cakes and flagons of

 

pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee

Jordan had let off some Filibuster’s Fireworks, so that

the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean

Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up

some impressive new banners, most of which depicted

Harry zooming around the Horntail’s head on his

Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his

head on fire.

Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten

what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down

with Ron and Hermione. He couldn’t believe how

happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he’d

gotten through the first task, and he wouldn’t have to

face the second one for three months.

“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up

the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and

weighing it in his hands. “Open it, Harry, go on! Let’s

just see what’s inside it!”

“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,”

Hermione said swiftly. “It’s in the tournament rules.

“I was supposed to work out how to get past the

dragon on my own too,” Harry muttered, so only

Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather

guiltily.

“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed.

Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his

fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around

it and prised it open.

It was hollow and completely empty — but the

moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a

loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The

 

nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost

orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party,

who had all been playing the musical saw.

“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.

“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at

the egg as Harry slammed it shut again. “Sounded

like a banshee. ... Maybe you’ve got to get past one of

those next, Harry!”

“It was someone being tortured!” said Neville, who

had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over

the floor. “You’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus

Curse!”

“Don’t be a prat, Neville, that’s illegal,” said George.

“They wouldn’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the

champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy

singing ... maybe you’ve got to attack him while he’s

in the shower, Harry.”

“Want a jam tart, Hermione?” said Fred.

Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was

offering her. Fred grinned.

“It’s all right,” he said. “I haven’t done anything to

them. It’s the custard creams you’ve got to watch — ”

Neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream,

choked and spat it out. Fred laughed.

“Just my little joke, Neville. ...”

Hermione took a jam tart. Then she said, “Did you get

all this from the kitchens, Fred?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Yep,” said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-

pitched squeak and imitated a house-elf. “ ‘Anything

we can get you, sir, anything at all!’ They’re dead

helpful ... get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.”

“How do you get in there?” Hermione said in an

innocently casual sort of voice.

“Easy,” said Fred, “concealed door behind a painting

of a bowl of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles

and — ” He stopped and looked suspiciously at her.

“Why?”

“Nothing,” said Hermione quickly.

“Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike

now, are you?” said George. “Going to give up all the

leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?”

Several people chortled. Hermione didn’t answer.

“Don’t you go upsetting them and telling them they’ve

got to take clothes and salaries!” said Fred warningly.

“You’ll put them off their cooking!”

Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning

into a large canary.

“Oh — sorry, Neville!” Fred shouted over all the

laughter. “I forgot — it was the custard creams we

hexed — ”

Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and

once his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking

entirely normal. He even joined in laughing.

“Canary Creams!” Fred shouted to the excitable

crowd. “George and I invented them — seven Sickles

each, a bargain!”

 

It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally

went up to the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus,

and Dean. Before he pulled the curtains of his four-

poster shut, Harry set his tiny model of the

Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed,

where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes.

Really, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on

his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point . . . they

were all right, really, dragons. ...

The start of December brought wind and sleet to

Hogwarts. Drafty though the castle always was in

winter, Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls

every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the

lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black

sails billowing against the dark skies. He thought the

Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly

too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame

Maxime’s horses well provided with their preferred

drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from

the trough in the corner of their paddock was enough

to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class

light-headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still

tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits

about them.

“I’m not sure whether they hibernate or not,” Hagrid

told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch

next lesson. “Thought we’d jus’ try an’ see if they

fancied a kip ... we’ll jus’ settle ’em down in these

boxes. ...”

There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their

desire to kill one another had not been exercised out

of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet

in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful,

scuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings

and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the

most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class

 

looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had

brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets.

“Well jus’ lead ’em in here,” Hagrid said, “an’ put the

lids on, and we’ll see what happens.”

But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and

did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes

and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, “Don’ panic,

now, don’ panic!” while the skrewts rampaged around

the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering

wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class — Malfoy,

Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead — had fled into

Hagrid ’s cabin through the back door and barricaded

themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however,

were among those who remained outside trying to

help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and

tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of

numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt

was left.

“Don’ frighten him, now!” Hagrid shouted as Ron and

Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at

the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on

them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. “Jus’

try an’ slip the rope ’round his sting, so he won’ hurt

any o’ the others!”

“Yeah, we wouldn’t want that!” Ron shouted angrily

as he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid ’s

cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks.

“Well, well, well ... this does look like fun.”

Rita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid ’s garden fence,

looking in at the mayhem. She was wearing a thick

magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and

her crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt

that was cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a

blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the

pumpkin plants nearby.

“Who ’re you?” Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he

slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt’s sting and

tightened it.

“Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,” Rita replied,

beaming at him. Her gold teeth glinted.

“Thought Dumbledore said you weren’ allowed inside

the school anymore,” said Hagrid, frowning slightly as

he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started

tugging it over to its fellows.

Rita acted as though she hadn’t heard what Hagrid

had said.

“What are these fascinating creatures called?” she

asked, beaming still more widely.

“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” grunted Hagrid.

“Really?” said Rita, apparently full of lively interest.

“I’ve never heard of them before ... where do they

come from?”

Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of

Hagrid’s wild black beard, and his heart sank. Where

had Hagrid got the skrewts from? Hermione, who

seemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly,

“They’re very interesting, aren’t they? Aren’t they,

Harry?”

“What? Oh yeah ... ouch ... interesting,” said Harry as

she stepped on his foot.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Ah, you’re here, Harry!” said Rita Skeeter as she

looked around. “So you like Care of Magical

Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?”

“Yes,” said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.

“Lovely,” said Rita. “Really lovely. Been teaching

long?” she added to Hagrid.

Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a

nasty cut across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes

were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several

burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where

most of the class stood, their noses pressed against

the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.

“This is o’ny me second year,” said Hagrid.

“Lovely... I don’t suppose you’d like to give an

interview, would you? Share some of your experience

of magical creatures? The Prophet does a zoological

column every Wednesday, as I’m sure you know. We

could feature these — er — Bang-Ended Scoots.”

“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” Hagrid said eagerly. “Er —

yeah, why not?”

Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was

no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita

Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in

silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made

arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a

good long interview later that week. Then the bell

rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson.

“Well, good-bye, Harry!” Rita Skeeter called merrily to

him as he set off with Ron and Hermione. “Until

Friday night, then, Hagrid!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Shell twist everything he says,” Harry said under his

breath.

“Just as long as he didn’t import those skrewts

illegally or anything,” said Hermione desperately.

They looked at one another — it was exactly the sort

of thing Hagrid might do.

“Hagrid’s been in loads of trouble before, and

Dumbledore’s never sacked him,” said Ron

consolingly. “Worst that can happen is Hagrid’ll have

to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry ... did I say worst? I

meant best.”

Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly

more cheerful, went off to lunch.

Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that

afternoon; they were still doing star charts and

predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends

once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again.

Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with

the pair of them when they had been predicting their

own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they

sniggered through her explanation of the various

ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.

“I would think,” she said, in a mystical whisper that

did not conceal her obvious annoyance, “that some of

us” — she stared very meaningfully at Harry —

“might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I

have seen during my crystal gazing last night. As I sat

here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult

the orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself

before it, and I gazed into its crystalline depths . . . and

what do you think I saw gazing back at me?”

“An ugly old bat in outsize specs?” Ron muttered

under his breath.

 

Harry fought hard to keep his face straight.

“Death, my dears.”

Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their

mouths, looking horrified.

“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively,

“it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a

vulture, ever lower ... ever lower over the castle. ...”

She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very

widely and obviously.

“It’d be a bit more impressive if she hadn’t done it

about eighty times before,” Harry said as they finally

regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath

Professor Trelawney’s room. “But if I’d dropped dead

every time she’s told me I’m going to, I’d be a medical

miracle.”

“You’d be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,” said

Ron, chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going

in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring

sinisterly. “At least we didn’t get homework. I hope

Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not

working when she is. ...”

But Hermione wasn’t at dinner, nor was she in the

library when they went to look for her afterward. The

only person in there was Viktor Krum. Ron hovered

behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum,

debating in whispers with Harry whether he should

ask for an autograph — but then Ron realized that six

or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books,

debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his

enthusiasm for the idea.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Wonder where she’s got to?” Ron said as he and

Harry went back to Gryffindor Tower.

“Dunno ... balderdash.”

But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward

when the sound of racing feet behind them

announced Hermione’s arrival.

“Harry!” she panted, skidding to a halt beside him

(the Fat Lady stared down at her, eyebrows raised).

“Harry, you’ve got to come — you’ve got to come, the

most amazing thing’s happened — please — ”

She seized Harry’s arm and started to try to drag him

back along the corridor.

“What’s the matter?” Harry said.

“I’ll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick

Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry,

intrigued.

“Okay,” Harry said, starting off back down the

corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.

“Oh don’t mind me!” the Fat Lady called irritably after

them. “Don’t apologize for bothering me! I’ll just hang

here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?”

“Yeah, thanks!” Ron shouted over his shoulder.

“Hermione, where are we going?” Harry asked, after

she had led them down through six floors, and

started down the marble staircase into the entrance

hall.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione

excitedly.

She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and

hurried toward the door through which Cedric

Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire

had regurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry had

never been through here before. He and Ron followed

Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of

ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the

one that led to Snape’s dungeon, they found

themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with

torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that

were mainly of food.

“Oh hang on ...” said Harry slowly, halfway down the

corridor. “Wait a minute, Hermione. ...”

“What?” She turned around to look at him,

anticipation all over her face.

“I know what this is about,” said Harry.

He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just

behind Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit

bowl.

“Hermione!” said Ron, cottoning on. “You’re trying to

rope us into that spew stuff again!”

“No, no, I’m not!” she said hastily. “And it’s not spew,

Ron — ”

“Changed the name, have you?” said Ron, frowning at

her. “What are we now, then, the House-Elf Liberation

Front? I’m not barging into that kitchen and trying to

make them stop work, I’m not doing it — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

‘Tm not asking you to!” Hermione said impatiently. “I

came down here just now, to talk to them all, and I

found — oh come on, Harry, I want to show you!”

She seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the

picture of the giant fruit bowl, stretched out her

forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear. It began

to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a

large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled

the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back,

forcing him inside.

He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-

ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with

mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped

around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at

the other end, when something small hurtled toward

him from the middle of the room, squealing, “Harry

Potter, sir! Harry Potteri”

Next second all the wind had been knocked out of

him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff,

hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would

break.

“D-Dobby?” Harry gasped.

“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from

somewhere around his navel. “Dobby has been

hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry

Potter has come to see him, sir!”

Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming

up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped

eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked

almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-

shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and

feet — all except the clothes, which were very

different.

 

When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had

always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now,

however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of

garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even

worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the

World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on

which he had pinned a number of bright badges; a tie

patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of

what looked like children’s soccer shorts, and odd

socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one

Harry had removed from his own foot and tricked Mr.

Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free.

The other was covered in pink and orange stripes.

“Dobby, what’re you doing here?” Harry said in

amazement.

“Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!” Dobby

squealed excitedly. “Professor Dumbledore gave

Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!”

“Winky?” said Harry. “She’s here too?”

“Yes, sir, yes!” said Dobby, and he seized Harry’s

hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the

four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of

these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was

positioned exactly beneath the four House tables

above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were

clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed

that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes

that were then sent up through the ceiling to their

counterparts above.

At least a hundred little elves were standing around

the kitchen, beaming, bowing, and curtsying as

Dobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing the

same uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts

crest, and tied, as Winky’s had been, like a toga.

 

Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and

pointed.

“Winky, sir!” he said.

Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike

Dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes. She

was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a

matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large

ears. However, while every one of Dobby ’s strange

collection of garments was so clean and well cared for

that it looked brand-new, Winky was plainly not

taking care of her clothes at all. There were soup

stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.

“Hello, Winky,” said Harry.

Winky’s lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which

spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed

down her front, just as they had done at the

Quidditch World Cup.

“Oh dear,” said Hermione. She and Ron had followed

Harry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. “Winky,

don’t cry, please don’t ...”

But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the

other hand, beamed up at Harry.

“Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?” he squeaked

loudly, over Winky’s sobs.

“Er — yeah, okay,” said Harry.

Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up

behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a

teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a milk

jug, and a large plate of biscuits.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Good service!” Ron said, in an impressed voice.

Hermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked

delighted; they bowed very low and retreated.

“How long have you been here, Dobby?” Harry asked

as Dobby handed around the tea.

“Only a week, Harry Potter, sir!” said Dobby happily.

“Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You

see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has

been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult

indeed — ”

At this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-

tomato of a nose dribbling all down her front, though

she made no effort to stem the flow.

“Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years,

sir, trying to find work!” Dobby squeaked. “But Dobby

hasn’t found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying

now!”

The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been

listening and watching with interest, all looked away

at these words, as though Dobby had said something

rude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said,

“Good for you, Dobby!”

“Thank you, miss!” said Dobby, grinning toothily at

her. “But most wizards doesn’t want a house-elf who

wants paying, miss. That’s not the point of a house-

elf,’ they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby ’s

face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes

and he wants to be paid, Harry Potter. . . . Dobby likes

being free!”

The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging

away from Dobby, as though he were carrying

something contagious. Winky, however, remained

 

where she was, though there was a definite increase

in the volume of her crying.

“And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky,

and finds out Winky has been freed too, sir!” said

Dobby delightedly.

At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and

lay facedown on the flagged stone floor, beating her

tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with

misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees

beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she

said made the slightest difference. Dobby continued

with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky’s

screeches.

“And then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir! Why

doesn’t Dobby and Winky find work together?’ Dobby

says. Where is there enough work for two house-

elves?’ says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes

to him, sir! Hogwarts\ So Dobby and Winky came to

see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor

Dumbledore took us on!”

Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled

in his eyes again.

“And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby,

sir, if Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf,

sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off

a month!”

“That’s not very much!” Hermione shouted

indignantly from the floor, over Winky’s continued

screaming and fist-beating.

“Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a

week, and weekends off,” said Dobby, suddenly giving

a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much

 

leisure and riches were frightening, “but Dobby beat

him down, miss. ... Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he

isn’t wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.”

“And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you,

Winky?” Hermione asked kindly.

If she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she

was wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when

she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her

massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and

suddenly furious.

“Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting

paid!” she squeaked. “Winky is not sunk so low as

that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!”

“Ashamed?” said Hermione blankly. “But — Winky,

come on! It’s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not

you! You didn’t do anything wrong, he was really

horrible to you — ”

But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over

the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she

couldn’t hear a word, and screeched, “You is not

insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr.

Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr.

Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!”

“Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,”

squeaked Dobby confidentially. “Winky forgets she is

not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is allowed to

speak her mind now, but she won’t do it.”

“Can’t house-elves speak their minds about their

masters, then?” Harry asked.

“Oh no, sir, no,” said Dobby, looking suddenly

serious. “ Tis part of the house-elf’s enslavement, sir.

 

We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We

upholds the family’s honor, and we never speaks ill of

them — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he

does not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said

we is free to — to — ”

Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry

closer. Harry bent forward. Dobby whispered, “He

said we is free to call him a — a barmy old codger if

we likes, sir!”

Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.

“But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,” he said,

talking normally again, and shaking his head so that

his ears flapped. “Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore

very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and

our silence for him.”

“But you can say what you like about the Malfoys

now?” Harry asked him, grinning.

A slightly fearful look came into Dobby’s immense

eyes.

“Dobby — Dobby could,” he said doubtfully. He

squared his small shoulders. “Dobby could tell Harry

Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark

wizards'.”

Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-

struck by his own daring — then he rushed over to

the nearest table and began banging his head on it

very hard, squealing, “ Bad Dobby ! Bad Dobby\”

Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled

him away from the table.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Thank you, Harry Potter, thank you,” said Dobby

breathlessly, rubbing his head.

“You just need a bit of practice,” Harry said.

“Practice!” squealed Winky furiously. “You is ought to

be ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way

about your masters!”

“They isn’t my masters anymore, Winky!” said Dobby

defiantly. “Dobby doesn’t care what they think

anymore!”

“Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!” moaned Winky, tears

leaking down her face once more. “My poor Mr.

Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is

needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after

the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it

before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her

...oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was

freed? Oh the shame, the shame!” She buried her face

in her skirt again and bawled.

“Winky,” said Hermione firmly, “I’m quite sure Mr.

Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you.

We’ve seen him, you know — ”

“You is seeing my master?” said Winky breathlessly,

raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more

and goggling at Hermione. “You is seeing him here at

Hogwarts?”

“Yes,” said Hermione, “he and Mr. Bagman are judges

in the Tri-wizard Tournament.”

“Mr. Bagman comes too?” squeaked Winky, and to

Harry’s great surprise (and Ron’s and Hermione’s too,

by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My

master isn’t liking him, oh no, not at all!”

“Bagman — bad?” said Harry.

“Oh yes,” Winky said, nodding her head furiously.

“My master is telling Winky some things! But Winky

is not saying ... Winky — Winky keeps her master’s

secrets. ...”

She dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her

sobbing into her skirt, “Poor master, poor master, no

Winky to help him no more!”

They couldn’t get another sensible word out of Winky.

They left her to her crying and finished their tea,

while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf

and his plans for his wages.

“Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!”

he said happily, pointing at his bare chest.

“Tell you what, Dobby,” said Ron, who seemed to have

taken a great liking to the elf, “I’ll give you the one my

mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from

her. You don’t mind maroon, do you?”

Dobby was delighted.

“We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,” Ron told

him, “but it’ll go well with your tea cozy.”

As they prepared to take their leave, many of the

surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering

snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with

a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and

curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets

with cream cakes and pies.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Thanks a lot!” Harry said to the elves, who had all

clustered around the door to say good night. “See

you, Dobby!”

“Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you

sometimes, sir?” Dobby asked tentatively.

“ ’Course you can,” said Harry, and Dobby beamed.

“You know what?” said Ron, once he, Hermione, and

Harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing

the steps into the entrance hall again. “All these years

I’ve been really impressed with Fred and George,

nicking food from the kitchens — well, it’s not exactly

difficult, is it? They can’t wait to give it away!”

“I think this is the best thing that could have

happened to those elves, you know,” said Hermione,

leading the way back up the marble staircase. “Dobby

coming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see

how happy he is, being free, and slowly it’ll dawn on

them that they want that too!”

“Let’s hope they don’t look too closely at Winky,” said

Harry.

“Oh shell cheer up,” said Hermione, though she

sounded a bit doubtful. “Once the shock’s worn off,

and she’s got used to Hogwarts, she’ll see how much

better off she is without that Crouch man.”

“She seems to love him,” said Ron thickly (he had just

started on a cream cake) .

“Doesn’t think much of Bagman, though, does she?”

said Harry. “Wonder what Crouch says at home about

him?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Probably says he’s not a very good Head of

Department,” said Hermione, “and let’s face it ... he’s

got a point, hasn’t he?”

“I’d still rather work for him than old Crouch,” said

Ron. “At least Bagman’s got a sense of humor.”

“Don’t let Percy hear you saying that,” Hermione said,

smiling slightly.

“Yeah, well, Percy wouldn’t want to work for anyone

with a sense of humor, would he?” said Ron, now

starting on a chocolate eclair. “Percy wouldn’t

recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him

wearing Dobby’s tea cozy.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE UNEXPECTED TASK

“Potter! Weasley! Will you pay attention?”

Professor McGonagall’s irritated voice cracked like a

whip through the Transfiguration class on Thursday,

and Harry and Ron both jumped and looked up.

It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their

work; the guinea fowl they had been changing into

guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on

Professor McGonagall’s desk (Neville’s still had

feathers); they had copied down their homework from

the blackboard (“Describe, with examples, the ways in

which Transforming Spells must be adapted when

performing Cross-Species Switches”). The bell was due

to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who had

been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and

George’s fake wands at the back of the class, looked

up, Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry, a rubber

haddock.

“Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough

to act their age,” said Professor McGonagall, with an

 

angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry’s

haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor — Ron’s

parrot’s beak had severed it moments before — “I

have something to say to you all.

“The Yule Ball is approaching — a traditional part of

the Tri-wizard Tournament and an opportunity for us

to socialize with our foreign guests. Now, the ball will

be open only to fourth years and above — although

you may invite a younger student if you wish — ”

Lavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil

nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working

furiously as she too fought not to giggle. They both

looked around at Harry. Professor McGonagall

ignored them, which Harry thought was distinctly

unfair, as she had just told off him and Ron.

“Dress robes will be worn,” Professor McGonagall

continued, “and the ball will start at eight o’clock on

Christmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great

Hall. Now then — ”

Professor McGonagall stared deliberately around the

class.

“The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er

— let our hair down,” she said, in a disapproving

voice.

Lavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand

pressed hard against her mouth to stifle the sound.

Harry could see what was funny this time: Professor

McGonagall, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as

though she had never let her hair down in any sense.

“But that does NOT mean,” Professor McGonagall

went on, “that we will be relaxing the standards of

behavior we expect from Hogwarts students. I will be

 

most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student

embarrasses the school in any way.”

The bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of

activity as everyone packed their bags and swung

them onto their shoulders.

Professor McGonagall called above the noise, “Potter

— a word, if you please.”

Assuming this had something to do with his headless

rubber haddock, Harry proceeded gloomily to the

teacher’s desk. Professor McGonagall waited until the

rest of the class had gone, and then said, “Potter, the

champions and their partners — ”

“What partners?” said Harry.

Professor McGonagall looked suspiciously at him, as

though she thought he was trying to be funny.

“Your partners for the Yule Ball, Potter,” she said

coldly. “Your dance partners.”

Harry’s insides seemed to curl up and shrivel.

“Dance partners?” He felt himself going red. “I don’t

dance,” he said quickly.

“Oh yes, you do,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.

“That’s what I’m telling you. Traditionally, the

champions and their partners open the ball.”

Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top

hat and tails, accompanied by a girl in the sort of

frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to Uncle

Vernon’s work parties.

“I’m not dancing,” he said.

 

“It is traditional,” said Professor McGonagall firmly.

“You are a Hogwarts champion, and you will do what

is expected of you as a representative of the school.

So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.”

“But — I don’t — ”

“You heard me, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall in

a very final sort of way.

A week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner

for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a

Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done the

latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to

the ball, he thought he’d rather have another round

with the dragon.

Harry had never known so many people to put their

names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he

always did, of course, because the alternative was

usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always

been very much in the minority before now. This year,

however, everyone in the fourth year and above

seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to

be obsessed with the coming ball — or at least all the

girls were, and it was amazing how many girls

Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never

quite noticed that before. Girls giggling and

whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with

laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly

comparing notes on what they were going to wear on

Christmas night. ...

“Why do they have to move in packs?” Harry asked

Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them,

sniggering and staring at Harry. “How’re you

supposed to get one on their own to ask them?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Lasso one?” Ron suggested. “Got any idea who you’re

going to try?”

Harry didn’t answer. He knew perfectly well whom

he’d like to ask, but working up the nerve was

something else. ... Cho was a year older than he was;

she was very pretty; she was a very good Quidditch

player, and she was also very popular.

Ron seemed to know what was going on inside

Harry’s head.

“Listen, you’re not going to have any trouble. You’re a

champion. You’ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I

bet they 11 be queuing up to go with you.”

In tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron

had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare

minimum. Moreover, to Harry’s amazement, he

turned out to be quite right.

A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom

Harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to

the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so

taken aback he said no before he’d even stopped to

consider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather

hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean’s, Seamus’s, and

Ron’s taunts about her all through History of Magic.

The following day, two more girls asked him, a second

year and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked as

though she might knock him out if he refused.

“She was quite good-looking,” said Ron fairly, after

he’d stopped laughing.

“She was a foot taller than me,” said Harry, still

unnerved. “Imagine what I’d look like trying to dance

with her.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Hermione’s words about Krum kept coming back to

him. “They only like him because he’s famous!” Harry

doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked

to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to

the ball with him if he hadn’t been a school

champion. Then he wondered if this would bother

him if Cho asked him.

On the whole, Harry had to admit that even with the

embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him,

life had definitely improved since he had got through

the first task. He wasn’t attracting nearly as much

unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which he

suspected had a lot to do with Cedric — he had an

idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave

Harry alone, in gratitude for Harry’s tip-off about the

dragons. There seemed to be fewer Support Cedric

Diggoryl badges around too. Draco Malfoy, of course,

was still quoting Rita Skeeter’s article to him at every

possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and

fewer laughs out of it — and just to heighten Harry’s

feeling of well-being, no story about Hagrid had

appeared in the Daily Prophet

“She didn’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures,

ter tell yeh the truth,” Hagrid said, when Harry, Ron,

and Hermione asked him how his interview with Rita

Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical

Creatures lesson of the term. To their very great relief,

Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the

skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind

his cabin today, sitting at a trestle table and

preparing a fresh selection of food with which to

tempt the skrewts.

“She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, Harry,”

Hagrid continued in a low voice. “Well, I told her we’d

been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the

Dursleys. ‘Never had to tell him off in four years?’ she

 

said. ‘Never played you up in lessons, has he?’ I told

her no, an’ she didn’ seem happy at all. Yeh’d think

she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry.”

“ ’Course she did,” said Harry, throwing lumps of

dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up

his knife to cut some more. “She can’t keep writing

about what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get boring.”

“She wants a new angle, Hagrid,” said Ron wisely as

he shelled salamander eggs. “You were supposed to

say Harry’s a mad delinquent!”

“But he’s not!” said Hagrid, looking genuinely

shocked.

“She should’ve interviewed Snape,” said Harry grimly.

“He’d give her the goods on me any day. ‘Potter has

been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this

school. . . . ’ ”

“Said that, did he?” said Hagrid, while Ron and

Hermione laughed. “Well, yeh might’ve bent a few

rules, Harry, bu’ yeh’re all righ’ really, aren’ you?”

“Cheers, Hagrid,” said Harry, grinning.

“You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day,

Hagrid?” said Ron.

“Though’ I might look in on it, yeah,” said Hagrid

gruffly. “Should be a good do, I reckon. You’ll be

openin’ the dancin’, won’ yeh, Harry? Who ’re you

takin’?”

“No one, yet,” said Harry, feeling himself going red

again. Hagrid didn’t pursue the subject.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

The last week of term became increasingly boisterous

as it progressed. Rumors about the Yule Ball were

flying everywhere, though Harry didn’t believe half of

them — for instance, that Dumbledore had bought

eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam

Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had

booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the

Weird Sisters were Harry didn’t know, never having

had access to a wizard’s wireless, but he deduced

from the wild excitement of those who had grown up

listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network)

that they were a very famous musical group.

Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick,

gave up trying to teach them much when their minds

were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play

games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of

it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning

Charm Harry had used during the first task of the

Triwizard Tournament. Other teachers were not so

generous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns,

for example, from plowing on through his notes on

goblin rebellions — as Binns hadn’t let his own death

stand in the way of continuing to teach, they

supposed a small thing like Christmas wasn’t going to

put him off. It was amazing how he could make even

bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as

Percy’s cauldron-bottom report. Professors

McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the

very last second of their classes too, and Snape, of

course, would no sooner let them play games in class

than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all,

he informed them that he would be testing them on

poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term.

“Evil, he is,” Ron said bitterly that night in the

Gryffindor common room. “Springing a test on us on

the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole

load of studying.”

 

“Mmm ... you’re not exactly straining yourself,

though, are you?” said Hermione, looking at him over

the top of her Potions notes. Ron was busy building a

card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack — a much

more interesting pastime than with Muggle cards,

because of the chance that the whole thing would

blow up at any second.

“It’s Christmas, Hermione,” said Harry lazily; he was

rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time

in an armchair near the fire.

Hermione looked severely over at him too. “I’d have

thought you’d be doing something constructive,

Harry, even if you don’t want to learn your antidotes!”

“Like what?” Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins

of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle

Bats Chaser.

“That egg!” Hermione hissed.

“Come on, Hermione, I’ve got till February the twenty-

fourth,” Harry said.

He had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and

hadn’t opened it since the celebration party after the

first task. There were still two and a half months to go

until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing

meant, after all.

“But it might take weeks to work it out!” said

Hermione. “You’re going to look a real idiot if everyone

else knows what the next task is and you don’t!”

“Leave him alone, Hermione, he’s earned a bit of a

break,” said Ron, and he placed the last two cards on

top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing

his eyebrows.

 

“Nice look, Ron ... go well with your dress robes, that

will.”

It was Fred and George. They sat down at the table

with Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Ron felt how much

damage had been done.

“Ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?” George asked.

“No, he’s off delivering a letter,” said Ron. “Why?”

“Because George wants to invite him to the ball,” said

Fred sarcastically.

“Because we want to send a letter, you stupid great

prat,” said George.

“Who d’you two keep writing to, eh?” said Ron.

“Nose out, Ron, or I’ll burn that for you too,” said

Fred, waving his wand threateningly. “So ... you lot

got dates for the ball yet?”

“Nope,” said Ron.

“Well, you’d better hurry up, mate, or all the good

ones will be gone,” said Fred.

“Who’re you going with, then?” said Ron.

“Angelina,” said Fred promptly, without a trace of

embarrassment.

“What?” said Ron, taken aback. “You’ve already asked

her?”

“Good point,” said Fred. He turned his head and

called across the common room, “Oi! Angelina!”

 

Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet

near the fire, looked over at him.

“What?” she called back.

“Want to come to the ball with me?”

Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.

“All right, then,” she said, and she turned back to

Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on

her face.

“There you go,” said Fred to Harry and Ron, “piece of

cake.”

He got to his feet, yawning, and said, “We’d better use

a school owl then, George, come on. ...”

They left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and

looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle

at Harry.

“We should get a move on, you know ... ask someone.

He’s right. We don’t want to end up with a pair of

trolls.”

Hermione let out a sputter of indignation.

“A pair of . . . what, excuse me?”

“Well — you know,” said Ron, shrugging. “I’d rather

go alone than with — with Eloise Midgen, say.”

“Her acne’s loads better lately — and she’s really

nice!”

“Her nose is off-center,” said Ron.

 

“Oh I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically,

you’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have

you, even if she’s completely horrible?”

“Er — yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.

“I’m going to bed,” Hermione snapped, and she swept

off toward the girls’ staircase without another word.

The Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire

to impress the visitors from Beauxbatons and

Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at

its best this Christmas. When the decorations went

up, Harry noticed that they were the most stunning

he had yet seen inside the school. Everlasting icicles

had been attached to the banisters of the marble

staircase; the usual twelve Christmas trees in the

Great Hall were bedecked with everything from

luminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls,

and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing

carols whenever anyone passed them. It was quite

something to hear “O Come, All Ye Faithful” sung by

an empty helmet that only knew half the words.

Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract

Peeves from inside the armor, where he had taken to

hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of

his own invention, all of which were very rude.

And still, Harry hadn’t asked Cho to the ball. He and

Ron were getting very nervous now, though as Harry

pointed out, Ron would look much less stupid than

he would without a partner; Harry was supposed to

be starting the dancing with the other champions.

“I suppose there’s always Moaning Myrtle,” he said

gloomily, referring to the ghost who haunted the girls’

toilets on the second floor.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Harry — we’ve just got to grit our teeth and do it,”

said Ron on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested

they were planning the storming of an impregnable

fortress. “When we get back to the common room

tonight, we’ll both have partners — agreed?”

“Er ... okay,” said Harry.

But every time he glimpsed Cho that day — during

break, and then lunchtime, and once on the way to

History of Magic — she was surrounded by friends.

Didn’t she ever go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps

ambush her as she was going into a bathroom? But

no — she even seemed to go there with an escort of

four or five girls. Yet if he didn’t do it soon, she was

bound to have been asked by somebody else.

He found it hard to concentrate on Snape’s Potions

test, and consequently forgot to add the key

ingredient — a bezoar — meaning that he received

bottom marks. He didn’t care, though; he was too

busy screwing up his courage for what he was about

to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and

hurried to the dungeon door.

“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to Ron and

Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs.

He’d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was

all. ... He hurried off through the packed corridors

looking for her, and (rather sooner than he had

expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense

Against the Dark Arts lesson.

“Er — Cho? Could I have a word with you?”

Giggling should be made illegal, Harry thought

furiously, as all the girls around Cho started doing it.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

She didn’t, though. She said, “Okay,” and followed

him out of earshot of her classmates.

Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a

weird lurch as though he had missed a step going

downstairs.

“Er,” he said.

He couldn’t ask her. He couldn’t. But he had to. Cho

stood there looking puzzled, watching him.

The words came out before Harry had quite got his

tongue around them.

“Wangoballwime?”

“Sorry?” said Cho.

“D’you — d’you want to go to the ball with me?” said

Harry. Why did he have to go red now? Why ?

“Oh!” said Cho, and she went red too. “Oh Harry, I’m

really sorry,” and she truly looked it. “I’ve already said

I’ll go with someone else.”

“Oh,” said Harry.

It was odd; a moment before his insides had been

writhing like snakes, but suddenly he didn’t seem to

have any insides at all.

“Oh okay,” he said, “no problem.”

“I’m really sorry,” she said again.

“That’s okay,” said Harry.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho

said, “Well — ”

“Yeah,” said Harry.

“Well, ’bye,” said Cho, still very red. She walked away.

Harry called after her, before he could stop himself.

“Who ’re you going with?”

“Oh — Cedric,” she said. “Cedric Diggory.”

“Oh right,” said Harry.

His insides had come back again. It felt as though

they had been filled with lead in their absence.

Completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly

back up to Gryffindor Tower, Cho’s voice echoing in

his ears with every step he took. “ Cedric — Cedric

Diggory.” He had been starting to quite like Cedric —

prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten

him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular,

and nearly everyone’s favorite champion. Now he

suddenly realized that Cedric was in fact a useless

pretty boy who didn’t have enough brains to fill an

eggcup.

“Fairy lights,” he said dully to the Fat Lady — the

password had been changed the previous day.

“Yes, indeed, dear!” she trilled, straightening her new

tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him.

Entering the common room, Harry looked around,

and to his surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen-faced in

a distant corner. Ginny was sitting with him, talking

to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.

 

“What’s up, Ron?” said Harry, joining them.

Ron looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his

face.

“Why did I do it?” he said wildly. “I don’t know what

made me do it!”

“What?” said Harry.

“He — er — just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the

ball with him,” said Ginny. She looked as though she

was fighting back a smile, but she kept patting Ron’s

arm sympathetically.

“You what?” said Harry.

“I don’t know what made me do it!” Ron gasped again.

“What was I playing at? There were people — all

around — I’ve gone mad — everyone watching! I was

just walking past her in the entrance hall — she was

standing there talking to Diggory — and it sort of

came over me — and I asked her!”

Ron moaned and put his face in his hands. He kept

talking, though the words were barely

distinguishable.

“She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something.

Didn’t even answer. And then — I dunno — I just sort

of came to my senses and ran for it.”

“She’s part veela,” said Harry. “You were right — her

grandmother was one. It wasn’t your fault, I bet you

just walked past when she was turning on the old

charm for Diggory and got a blast of it — but she was

wasting her time. He’s going with Cho Chang.”

Ron looked up.

 

“I asked her to go with me just now,” Harry said dully,

“and she told me.”

Ginny had suddenly stopped smiling.

“This is mad,” said Ron. “We’re the only ones left who

haven’t got anyone — well, except Neville. Hey —

guess who he asked? Hermionel”

“ What?” said Harry, completely distracted by this

startling news.

“Yeah, I know!” said Ron, some of the color coming

back into his face as he started to laugh. “He told me

after Potions! Said she’s always been really nice,

helping him out with work and stuff — but she told

him she was already going with someone. Ha! As if!

She just didn’t want to go with Neville ... I mean, who

would?”

“Don’t!” said Ginny, annoyed. “Don’t laugh — ”

Just then Hermione climbed in through the portrait

hole.

“Why weren’t you two at dinner?” she said, coming

over to join them.

“Because — oh shut up laughing, you two — because

they’ve both just been turned down by girls they

asked to the ball!” said Ginny.

That shut Harry and Ron up.

“Thanks a bunch, Ginny,” said Ron sourly.

“All the good-looking ones taken, Ron?” said

Hermione loftily. “Eloise Midgen starting to look quite

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

pretty now, is she? Well, I’m sure you’ll find someone

somewhere who’ll have you.”

But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly

seeing her in a whole new light.

“Hermione, Neville’s right — you are a girl. ...”

“Oh well spotted,” she said acidly.

“Well — you can come with one of us!”

“No, I can’t,” snapped Hermione.

“Oh come on,” he said impatiently, “we need partners,

we’re going to look really stupid if we haven’t got any,

everyone else has ...”

“I can’t come with you,” said Hermione, now blushing,

“because I’m already going with someone.”

“No, you’re not!” said Ron. “You just said that to get

rid of Neville!”

“Oh did I?” said Hermione, and her eyes flashed

dangerously. “Just because it’s taken you three years

to notice, Ron, doesn’t mean no one else has spotted

I’m a girl!”

Ron stared at her. Then he grinned again.

“Okay, okay, we know you’re a girl,” he said. “That

do? Will you come now?”

“I’ve already told you!” Hermione said very angrily.

“I’m going with someone else!”

And she stormed off toward the girls’ dormitories

again.

 

“She’s lying,” said Ron flatly, watching her go.

“She’s not,” said Ginny quietly.

“Who is it then?” said Ron sharply.

“I’m not telling you, it’s her business,” said Ginny.

“Right,” said Ron, who looked extremely put out, “this

is getting stupid. Ginny, you can go with Harry, and

I’ll just—”

“I can’t,” said Ginny, and she went scarlet too. “I’m

going with — with Neville. He asked me when

Hermione said no, and I thought ... well ... I’m not

going to be able to go otherwise, I’m not in fourth

year.” She looked extremely miserable. “I think I’ll go

and have dinner,” she said, and she got up and

walked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed.

Ron goggled at Harry.

“What’s got into them?” he demanded.

But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come

in through the portrait hole. The time had come for

drastic action.

“Wait here,” he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked

straight up to Parvati, and said, “Parvati? Will you go

to the ball with me?”

Parvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for

them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of

his robes.

“Yes, all right then,” she said finally, blushing

furiously.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Thanks,” said Harry, in relief. “Lavender — will you

go with Ron?”

“She’s going with Seamus,” said Parvati, and the pair

of them giggled harder than ever.

Harry sighed.

“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with Ron?” he

said, lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn’t hear.

“What about Hermione Granger?” said Parvati.

“She’s going with someone else.”

Parvati looked astonished.

“Ooooh — who?” she said keenly.

Harry shrugged. “No idea,” he said. “So what about

Ron?”

“Well ...” said Parvati slowly, “I suppose my sister

might ... Padma, you know ... in Ravenclaw. I’ll ask

her if you like.”

“Yeah, that would be great,” said Harry. “Let me

know, will you?”

And he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball

was a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping

very much that Padma Patil’s nose was dead center.

THE YULE BALL

Despite the very heavy load of homework that the

fourth years had been given for the holidays, Harry

was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent

the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as

fully as possible along with everyone else. Gryffindor

Tower was hardly less crowded now than during

term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as

its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than

usual. Fred and George had had a great success with

their Canary Creams, and for the first couple of days

of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all

over the place. Before long, however, all the

Gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else

offered them with extreme caution, in case it had a

Canary Cream concealed in the center, and George

confided to Harry that he and Fred were now working

on developing something else. Harry made a mental

note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred

and George in future. He still hadn’t forgotten Dudley

and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its

grounds now. The pale blue Beauxbatons carriage

looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the

iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid’s cabin, while

the Durmstrang ship’s portholes were glazed with ice,

the rigging white with frost. The house-elves down in

the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of

rich, warming stews and savory puddings, and only

Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find anything to

complain about.

“It is too ’eavy, all zis ’Ogwarts food,” they heard her

saying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her

one evening (Ron skulking behind Harry, keen not to

be spotted by Fleur). “I will not fit into my dress

robes!”

“Oooh there’s a tragedy,” Hermione snapped as Fleur

went out into the entrance hall. “She really thinks a

lot of herself, that one, doesn’t she?”

“Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?”

said Ron.

He kept springing this question on her, hoping to

startle her into a response by asking it when she least

expected it. However, Hermione merely frowned and

said, “I’m not telling you, you’ll just make fun of me.”

“You’re joking, Weasley!” said Malfoy, behind them.

“You’re not telling me someone’s asked that to the

ball? Not the long-molared Mudblood?”

Harry and Ron both whipped around, but Hermione

said loudly, waving to somebody over Malfoy’s

shoulder, “Hello, Professor Moody!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Malfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking

wildly around for Moody, but he was still up at the

staff table, finishing his stew.

“Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?” said

Hermione scathingly, and she, Harry, and Ron went

up the marble staircase laughing heartily.

“Hermione,” said Ron, looking sideways at her,

suddenly frowning, “your teeth ...”

“What about them?” she said.

“Well, they’re different ... I’ve just noticed. ...”

“Of course they are — did you expect me to keep

those fangs Malfoy gave me?”

“No, I mean, they’re different to how they were before

he put that hex on you. ... They’re all ... straight and

— and normal-sized.”

Hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and

Harry noticed it too: It was a very different smile from

the one he remembered.

“Well ... when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get

them shrunk, she held up a mirror and told me to

stop her when they were back to how they normally

were,” she said. “And I just ... let her carry on a bit.”

She smiled even more widely. “Mum and Dad won’t be

too pleased. I’ve been trying to persuade them to let

me shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry

on with my braces. You know, they’re dentists, they

just don’t think teeth and magic should — look!

Pigwidgeon’s back!”

Ron’s tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the

icicle-laden banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to

 

his leg. People passing him were pointing and

laughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and

said, “Oh look at the weeny owl! Isn’t he cute?”

“Stupid little feathery git!” Ron hissed, hurrying up

the stairs and snatching up Pigwidgeon. “You bring

letters to the addressee! You don’t hang around

showing off!”

Pigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over

Ron’s fist. The third-year girls all looked very

shocked.

“Clear off!” Ron snapped at them, waving the fist

holding Pigwidgeon, who hooted more happily than

ever as he soared through the air. “Here — take it,

Harry,” Ron added in an undertone as the third-year

girls scuttled away looking scandalized. He pulled

Sirius’s reply off Pigwidgeon’s leg, Harry pocketed it,

and they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it.

Everyone in the common room was much too busy in

letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone

else was up to. Ron, Harry, and Hermione sat apart

from everyone else by a dark window that was

gradually filling up with snow, and Harry read out:

Dear Harry,

Congratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever

put your name in that goblet shouldn’t be feeling too

happy right now! I was going to suggest a

Conjunctivitis Curse, as a dragon’s eyes are its

weakest point — “That’s what Krum did!” Hermione

whispered — but your way was better, I’m impressed.

Don’t get complacent, though, Harry. You’ve only done

one task; whoever put you in for the tournament’s got

plenty more opportunity if they’re trying to hurt you.

 

Keep your eyes open — particularly when the person

we discussed is around — and concentrate on keeping

yourself out of trouble.

Keep in touch, I still want to hear about anything

unusual.

Sirius

“He sounds exactly like Moody,” said Harry quietly,

tucking the letter away again inside his robes. “

‘Constant vigilance!’ You’d think I walk around with

my eyes shut, banging off the walls. ...”

“But he’s right, Harry,” said Hermione, “you have still

got two tasks to do. You really ought to have a look at

that egg, you know, and start working out what it

means. ...”

“Hermione, he’s got ages!” snapped Ron. “Want a

game of chess, Harry?”

“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. Then, spotting the look on

Hermione ’s face, he said, “Come on, how’m I

supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on?

I won’t even be able to hear the egg over this lot.”

“Oh I suppose not,” she sighed, and she sat down to

watch their chess match, which culminated in an

exciting checkmate of Ron’s, involving a couple of

recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop.

Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day.

Wondering what had caused his abrupt return to

consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw

something with very large, round, green eyes staring

back at him in the darkness, so close they were

almost nose to nose.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Dobbyl” Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf

so fast he almost fell out of bed. “Don’t do that!”

“Dobby is sorry, sir!” squeaked Dobby anxiously,

jumping backward with his long fingers over his

mouth. “Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter

‘Merry Christmas’ and bring him a present, sir! Harry

Potter did say Dobby could come and see him

sometimes, sir!”

“It’s okay,” said Harry, still breathing rather faster

than usual, while his heart rate returned to normal.

“Just — just prod me or something in future, all right,

don’t bend over me like that. ...”

Harry pulled back the curtains around his four-

poster, took his glasses from his bedside table, and

put them on. His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus,

Dean, and Neville. All of them were peering through

the gaps in their own hangings, heavy-eyed and

tousle-haired.

“Someone attacking you, Harry?” Seamus asked

sleepily.

“No, it’s just Dobby,” Harry muttered. “Go back to

sleep.”

“Nah ... presents!” said Seamus, spotting the large

pile at the foot of his bed. Ron, Dean, and Neville

decided that now they were awake they might as well

get down to some present-opening too. Harry turned

back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next

to Harry’s bed, still looking worried that he had upset

Harry. There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop

on top of his tea cozy.

“Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?” he

squeaked tentatively.

 

“ ’Course you can,” said Harry. “Er ... I’ve got

something for you too.”

It was a lie; he hadn’t bought anything for Dobby at

all, but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a

particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks. They

were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had

once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were

extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to

cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He

pulled out the Sneakoscope and handed the socks to

Dobby, saying, “Sorry, I forgot to wrap them. ...”

But Dobby was utterly delighted.

“Socks are Dobby’s favorite, favorite clothes, sir!” he

said, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle

Vernon’s. “I has seven now, sir. ... But sir ...” he said,

his eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to

their highest extent, so that they reached to the

bottom of his shorts, “they has made a mistake in the

shop, Harry Potter, they is giving you two the same!”

“Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn’t spot that?” said

Ron, grinning over from his own bed, which was now

strewn with wrapping paper. “Tell you what, Dobby —

here you go — take these two, and you can mix them

up properly. And here’s your sweater.”

He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just

unwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs.

Weasley had sent. Dobby looked quite overwhelmed.

“Sir is very kind!” he squeaked, his eyes brimming

with tears again, bowing deeply to Ron. “Dobby knew

sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter’s

greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was

also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“They’re only socks,” said Ron, who had gone slightly

pink around the ears, though he looked rather

pleased all the same. “Wow, Harry — ” He had just

opened Harry’s present, a Chudley Cannon hat.

“Cool!” He jammed it onto his head, where it clashed

horribly with his hair.

Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which

turned out to be — socks.

“Dobby is making them himself, sir!” the elf said

happily. “He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!”

The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of

broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a

pattern of Snitches.

“They’re ... they’re really ... well, thanks, Dobby,” said

Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes

to leak with happiness again.

“Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making

Christmas dinner in the kitchens!” said Dobby, and

he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good-bye to

Ron and the others as he passed.

Harry’s other presents were much more satisfactory

than Dobby’s odd socks — with the obvious exception

of the Dursleys’, which consisted of a single tissue, an

all-time low — Harry supposed they too were

remembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee. Hermione had

given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain

and Ireland ; Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs;

Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock

any lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box

of sweets including all Harry’s favorites: Bertie Bott’s

Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble’s Best

Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees. There was also,

of course, Mrs. Weasley’s usual package, including a

 

new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it —

Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the

Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince

pies.

Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common

room, and they went down to breakfast together. They

spent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower, where

everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned

to the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which

included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas

puddings, and large piles of Cribbage’s Wizarding

Crackers.

They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the

snow was untouched except for the deep channels

made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students

on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to

watch Harry and the Weasleys’ snowball fight rather

than join in, and at five o’clock said she was going

back upstairs to get ready for the ball.

“What, you need three hours?” said Ron, looking at

her incredulously and paying for his lapse in

concentration when a large snowball, thrown by

George, hit him hard on the side of the head. “Who ’re

you going with?” he yelled after Hermione, but she

just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into

the castle.

There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball

included a feast, so at seven o’clock, when it had

become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned

their snowball fight and trooped back to the common

room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her

friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely

tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the

bottom of her picture.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Lairy fights, that’s the one!” she giggled when they

gave the password, and she swung forward to let

them inside.

Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into

their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them

looking very self-conscious, but none as much as

Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the

corner with an appalled look on his face. There was

just no getting around the fact that his robes looked

more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate

attempt to make them look more manly, he used a

Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly

well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn’t

done a very neat job, and the edges still looked

depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.

“I still can’t work out how you two got the best-

looking girls in the year,” muttered Dean.

“Animal magnetism,” said Ron gloomily, pulling stray

threads out of his cuffs.

The common room looked strange, full of people

wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of

black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the

stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of

shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with

gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists.

Harry was relieved to see that she wasn’t giggling.

“You — er — look nice,” he said awkwardly.

“Thanks,” she said. “Padma’s going to meet you in the

entrance hall,” she added to Ron.

“Right,” said Ron, looking around. “Where’s

Hermione?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Parvati shrugged. “Shall we go down then, Harry?”

“Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the

common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed

him on the way out of the portrait hole.

The entrance hall was packed with students too, all

milling around waiting for eight o’clock, when the

doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Those

people who were meeting partners from different

Houses were edging through the crowd trying to find

one another. Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led

her over to Harry and Ron.

“Hi,” said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as

Parvati in robes of bright turquoise. She didn’t look

too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner,

though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and

sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and

down.

“Hi,” said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around

at the crowd. “Oh no ...”

He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry,

because Fleur Delacour was passing, looking

stunning in robes of silver-gray satin, and

accompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch captain,

Roger Davies. When they had disappeared, Ron stood

straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.

“Where is Hermione?” he said again.

A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their

dungeon common room. Malfoy was in front; he was

wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar,

which in Harry’s opinion made him look like a vicar.

Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was

clutching Malfoy’s arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both

 

wearing green; they resembled moss-colored boulders,

and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had

managed to find a partner.

The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to

look as the Durmstrang students entered with

Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the

party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes

Harry didn’t know. Over their heads he saw that an

area of lawn right in front of the castle had been

transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights —

meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting

in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and

fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be

Father Christmas and his reindeer.

Then Professor McGonagall’s voice called,

“Champions over here, please!”

Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and

Harry said “See you in a minute” to Ron and Padma

and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to

let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was

wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a

rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim of her

hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while

everyone else went inside; they were to enter the

Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students

had sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies

stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked

so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a

partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her.

Cedric and Cho were close to Harry too; he looked

away from them so he wouldn’t have to talk to them.

His eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw

dropped.

It was Hermione.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

But she didn’t look like Hermione at all. She had done

something with her hair; it was no longer bushy but

sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot

at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made

of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was

holding herself differently, somehow — or maybe it

was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she

usually had slung over her back. She was also

smiling — rather nervously, it was true — but the

reduction in the size of her front teeth was more

noticeable than ever; Harry couldn’t understand how

he hadn’t spotted it before.

“Hi, Harry!” she said. “Hi, Parvati!”

Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering

disbelief. She wasn’t the only one either; when the

doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum’s fan club from

the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of

deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as

she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn’t seem

to be able to find an insult to throw at her. Ron,

however, walked right past Hermione without looking

at her.

Once everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor

McGonagall told the champions and their partners to

get in line in pairs and to follow her. They did so, and

everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered

and started walking up toward a large round table at

the top of the Hall, where the judges were sitting.

The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling

silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe

and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The House

tables had vanished; instead, there were about a

hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about

a dozen people.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet.

Parvati seemed to be enjoying herself; she was

beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so

forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog

she was putting through its paces. He caught sight of

Ron and Padma as he neared the top table. Ron was

watching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes. Padma

was looking sulky.

Dumbledore smiled happily as the champions

approached the top table, but Karkaroff wore an

expression remarkably like Ron’s as he watched

Krum and Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman,

tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow

stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the

students; and Madame Maxime, who had changed

her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of

lavender silk, was applauding them politely. But Mr.

Crouch, Harry suddenly realized, was not there. The

fifth seat at the table was occupied by Percy Weasley.

When the champions and their partners reached the

table, Percy drew out the empty chair beside him,

staring pointedly at Harry. Harry took the hint and

sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new,

navy-blue dress robes and an expression of such

smugness that Harry thought it ought to be fined.

“I’ve been promoted,” Percy said before Harry could

even ask, and from his tone, he might have been

announcing his election as supreme ruler of the

universe. “I’m now Mr. Crouch’s personal assistant,

and I’m here representing him.”

“Why didn’t he come?” Harry asked. He wasn’t looking

forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all

through dinner.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

‘Tm afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn’t well, not well at all.

Hasn’t been right since the World Cup. Hardly

surprising — overwork. He’s not as young as he was

— though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind

remains as great as it ever was. But the World Cup

was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then, Mr.

Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the

misbehavior of that house-elf of his, Blinky, or

whatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her

immediately afterward, but — well, as I say, he’s

getting on, he needs looking after, and I think he’s

found a definite drop in his home comforts since she

left. And then we had the tournament to arrange, and

the aftermath of the Cup to deal with — that revolting

Skeeter woman buzzing around — no, poor man, he’s

having a well earned, quiet Christmas. I’m just glad

he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take

his place.”

Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch

had stopped calling Percy “Weatherby” yet, but

resisted the temptation.

There was no food as yet on the glittering golden

plates, but small menus were lying in front of each of

them. Harry picked his up uncertainly and looked

around — there were no waiters. Dumbledore,

however, looked carefully down at his own menu,

then said very clearly to his plate, “Pork chops!”

And pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of

the table placed their orders with their plates too.

Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt

about this new and more complicated method of

dining — surely it meant plenty of extra work for the

house-elves? — but for once, Hermione didn’t seem to

be thinking about S.P.E.W. She was deep in talk with

Viktor Krum and hardly seemed to notice what she

was eating.

 

It now occurred to Harry that he had never actually

heard Krum speak before, but he was certainly

talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.

“Veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as

comfortable, I am thinking,” he was telling Hermione.

“Ve have just four floors, and the fires are lit only for

magical purposes. But ve have grounds larger even

than these — though in vinter, ve have very little

daylight, so ve are not enjoying them. But in summer

ve are flying every day, over the lakes and the

mountains — ”

“Now, now, Viktor!” said Karkaroff with a laugh that

didn’t reach his cold eyes, “don’t go giving away

anything else, now, or your charming friend will know

exactly where to find us!”

Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. “Igor, all this

secrecy ... one would almost think you didn’t want

visitors.”

“Well, Dumbledore,” said Karkaroff, displaying his

yellowing teeth to their fullest extent, “we are all

protective of our private domains, are we not? Do we

not jealously guard the halls of learning that have

been entrusted to us? Are we not right to be proud

that we alone know our school’s secrets, and right to

protect them?”

“Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all

Hogwarts’ secrets, Igor,” said Dumbledore amicably.

“Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong

turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself

in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen

before, containing a really rather magnificent

collection of chamber pots. When I went back to

investigate more closely, I discovered that the room

had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it.

 

Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the

morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon

— or when the seeker has an exceptionally full

bladder.”

Harry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy

frowned, but Harry could have sworn Dumbledore

had given him a very small wink.

Meanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the

Hogwarts decorations to Roger Davies.

“Zis is nothing,” she said dismissively, looking around

at the sparkling walls of the Great Hall. “At ze Palace

of Beauxbatons, we ’ave ice sculptures all around ze

dining chamber at Chreestmas. Zey do not melt, of

course . . . zey are like ’uge statues of diamond,

glittering around ze place. And ze food is seemply

superb. And we ’ave choirs of wood nymphs, ’oo

serenade us as we eat. We ’ave none of zis ugly armor

in ze ’alls, and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into

Beauxbatons, ’e would be expelled like zat.” She

slapped her hand onto the table impatiently.

Roger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed

look on his face, and he kept missing his mouth with

his fork. Harry had the impression that Davies was

too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was

saying.

“Absolutely right,” he said quickly, slapping his own

hand down on the table in imitation of Fleur. “Like

that. Yeah.”

Harry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at

one of the other staff tables; he was back in his

horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top

table. Harry saw him give a small wave, and looking

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

around, saw Madame Maxime return it, her opals

glittering in the candlelight.

Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name

properly; he kept calling her “Hermy-own.”

“Her-my-oh-nee,” she said slowly and clearly.

“Herm-own-ninny.”

“Close enough,” she said, catching Harry’s eye and

grinning.

When all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore

stood up and asked the students to do the same.

Then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables zoomed

back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then

he conjured a raised platform into existence along the

right wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a

cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it.

The Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to

wildly enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely

hairy and dressed in black robes that had been

artfully ripped and torn. They picked up their

instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested

in watching them that he had almost forgotten what

was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all

the other tables had gone out, and that the other

champions and their partners were standing up.

“Come on!” Parvati hissed. “We’re supposed to dance!”

Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up.

The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune;

Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor,

carefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye (he could see

Seamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering), and

next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed

 

one around her waist, and was holding the other

tightly in hers.

It wasn’t as bad as it could have been, Harry thought,

revolving slowly on the spot (Parvati was steering) . He

kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching

people, and very soon many of them too had come

onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no

longer the center of attention. Neville and Ginny were

dancing nearby — he could see Ginny wincing

frequently as Neville trod on her feet — and

Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He

was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat

barely tickled her chin; however, she moved very

gracefully for a woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody was

doing an extremely ungainly two-step with Professor

Sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg.

“Nice socks, Potter,” Moody growled as he passed, his

magical eye staring through Harry’s robes.

“Oh — yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for

me,” said Harry, grinning.

“He is so creepy\” Parvati whispered as Moody

clunked away. “I don’t think that eye should be

allowed]”

Harry heard the final, quavering note from the

bagpipe with relief. The Weird Sisters stopped playing,

applause filled the hall once more, and Harry let go of

Parvati at once.

“Let’s sit down, shall we?”

“Oh — but — this is a really good one!” Parvati said

as the Weird Sisters struck up a new song, which was

much faster.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“No, I don’t like it,” Harry lied, and he led her away

from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who

were dancing so exhuberantly that people around

them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to

the table where Ron and Padma were sitting.

“How’s it going?” Harry asked Ron, sitting down and

opening a bottle of butterbeer.

Ron didn’t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and

Krum, who were dancing nearby. Padma was sitting

with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in

time to the music. Every now and then she threw a

disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring

her. Parvati sat down on Harry’s other side, crossed

her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked

to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.

“You don’t mind, do you, Harry?” Parvati said.

“What?” said Harry, who was now watching Cho and

Cedric.

“Oh never mind,” snapped Parvati, and she went off

with the boy from Beauxbatons. When the song

ended, she did not return.

Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati’s empty

chair. She was a bit pink in the face from dancing.

“Hi,” said Harry. Ron didn’t say anything.

“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said Hermione, fanning herself with

her hand. “Viktor’s just gone to get some drinks.”

Ron gave her a withering look. “Viktor?” he said.

“Hasn’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Hermione looked at him in surprise. “What’s up with

you?” she said.

“If you don’t know,” said Ron scathingly, “I’m not

going to tell you.”

Hermione stared at him, then at Harry, who

shrugged.

“Ron, what — ?”

“He’s from Durmstrang!” spat Ron. “He’s competing

against Harry! Against Hogwarts! You — you’re — ”

Ron was obviously casting around for words strong

enough to describe Hermione ’s crime, “ fraternizing

with the enemy, that’s what you’re doing!”

Hermione’s mouth fell open.

“Don’t be so stupid!” she said after a moment. “The

enemy\ Honestly — who was the one who was all

excited when they saw him arrive? Who was the one

who wanted his autograph? Who’s got a model of him

up in their dormitory?”

Ron chose to ignore this. “I s’pose he asked you to

come with him while you were both in the library?”

“Yes, he did,” said Hermione, the pink patches on her

cheeks glowing more brightly. “So what?”

“What happened — trying to get him to join spew,

were you?”

“No, I wasn’t! If you really want to know, he — he said

he’d been coming up to the library every day to try

and talk to me, but he hadn’t been able to pluck up

the courage!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Hermione said this very quickly, and blushed so

deeply that she was the same color as Parvati’s robes.

“Yeah, well — that’s his story,” said Ron nastily.

“And what’s that supposed to mean?”

“Obvious, isn’t it? He’s Karkaroff’s student, isn’t he?

He knows who you hang around with. ... He’s just

trying to get closer to Harry — get inside information

on him — or get near enough to jinx him — ”

Hermione looked as though Ron had slapped her.

When she spoke, her voice quivered.

“For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single

thing about Harry, not one — ”

Ron changed tack at the speed of light.

“Then he’s hoping you’ll help him find out what his

egg means! I suppose you’ve been putting your heads

together during those cozy little library sessions — ”

“I’d never help him work out that egg!” said Hermione,

looking outraged. “Never. How could you say

something like that — I want Harry to win the

tournament, Harry knows that, don’t you, Harry?”

“You’ve got a funny way of showing it,” sneered Ron.

“This whole tournament’s supposed to be about

getting to know foreign wizards and making friends

with them!” said Hermione hotly.

“No it isn’t!” shouted Ron. “It’s about winning!”

People were starting to stare at them.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Ron,” said Harry quietly, “I haven’t got a problem

with Hermione coming with Krum — ”

But Ron ignored Harry too.

“Why don’t you go and find Vicky, he’ll be wondering

where you are,” said Ron.

“Don’t call him Vickyl”

Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across

the dance floor, disappearing into the crowd. Ron

watched her go with a mixture of anger and

satisfaction on his face.

“Are you going to ask me to dance at all?” Padma

asked him.

“No,” said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.

“Fine,” snapped Padma, and she got up and went to

join Parvati and the Beauxbatons boy, who conjured

up one of his friends to join them so fast that Harry

could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a

Summoning Charm.

“Vare is Herm-own-ninny?” said a voice.

Krum had just arrived at their table clutching two

butterbeers.

“No idea,” said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. “Lost

her, have you?”

Krum was looking surly again.

“Veil, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks,” he said,

and he slouched off.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?”

Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together

and looking extremely pompous. “Excellent! That’s

the whole point, you know — international magical

cooperation!”

To Harry’s displeasure, Percy now took Padma’s

vacated seat. The top table was now empty; Professor

Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo

Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime

and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the

dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and

Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next

song ended, everybody applauded once more, and

Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall’s

hand and make his way back through the crowds, at

which point Fred and George accosted him.

“What do they think they’re doing, annoying senior

Ministry members?” Percy hissed, watching Fred and

George suspiciously. “No respect ...”

Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly

quickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and

came over to their table.

“I hope my brothers weren’t bothering you, Mr.

Bagman?” said Percy at once.

“What? Oh not at all, not at all!” said Bagman. “No,

they were just telling me a bit more about those fake

wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on

the marketing. I’ve promised to put them in touch

with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko’s Joke

Shop. ...”

Percy didn’t look happy about this at all, and Harry

was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs.

 

Weasley about this the moment he got home.

Apparently Fred and George’s plans had grown even

more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to

the public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry

something, but Percy diverted him.

“How do you feel the tournament’s going, Mr.

Bagman? Our department’s quite satisfied — the

hitch with the Goblet of Fire” — he glanced at Harry

— “was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to

have gone very smoothly since, don’t you think?”

“Oh yes,” Bagman said cheerfully, “it’s all been

enormous fun. How’s old Barty doing? Shame he

couldn’t come.”

“Oh I’m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no

time,” said Percy importantly, “but in the meantime,

I’m more than willing to take up the slack. Of course,

it’s not all attending balls” — he laughed airily — “oh

no, I’ve had to deal with all sorts of things that have

cropped up in his absence — you heard Ali Bashir

was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets

into the country? And then we’ve been trying to

persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International

Ban on Dueling. I’ve got a meeting with their Head of

Magical Cooperation in the new year — ”

“Let’s go for a walk,” Ron muttered to Harry, “get

away from Percy. ...”

Pretending they wanted more drinks, Harry and Ron

left the table, edged around the dance floor, and

slipped out into the entrance hall. The front doors

stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose

garden winked and twinkled as they went down the

front steps, where they found themselves surrounded

by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large

stone statues. Harry could hear splashing water,

 

which sounded like a fountain. Here and there, people

were sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set off

along one of the winding paths through the

rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way when

they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.

"... don’t see what there is to fuss about, Igor.”

“Severus, you cannot pretend this isn’t happening!”

Karkaroff’s voice sounded anxious and hushed, as

though keen not to be overheard. “It’s been getting

clearer and clearer for months. I am becoming

seriously concerned, I can’t deny it — ”

“Then flee,” said Snape’s voice curtly. “Flee — I will

make your excuses. I, however, am remaining at

Hogwarts.”

Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape

had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart,

his expression most ill-natured. Squeals issued from

many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from

them.

“Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!” Snape snarled

as a girl ran past him. “And ten points from Hufflepuff

too, Stebbins!” as a boy went rushing after her. “And

what are you two doing?” he added, catching sight of

Harry and Ron on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry

saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them

standing there. His hand went nervously to his

goatee, and he began winding it around his finger.

“We’re walking,” Ron told Snape shortly. “Not against

the law, is it?”

“Keep walking, then!” Snape snarled, and he brushed

past them, his long black cloak billowing out behind

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape. Harry and

Ron continued down the path.

“What’s got Karkaroff all worried?” Ron muttered.

“And since when have he and Snape been on first-

name terms?” said Harry slowly.

They had reached a large stone reindeer now, over

which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall

fountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous

people were visible on a stone bench, watching the

water in the moonlight. And then Harry heard Hagrid

speak.

“Momen’ I saw yeh, I knew,” he was saying, in an

oddly husky voice.

Harry and Ron froze. This didn’t sound like the sort of

scene they ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry

looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur

Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in

a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder

and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they

could easily sneak off that way without being noticed

(Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but

Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur,

shook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper

into the shadows behind the reindeer.

“What did you know, ’Agrid?” said Madame Maxime, a

purr in her low voice.

Harry definitely didn’t want to listen to this; he knew

Hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like

this (he certainly would have) — if it had been

possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and

hummed loudly, but that wasn’t really an option.

Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle

 

crawling along the stone reindeer’s back, but the

beetle just wasn’t interesting enough to block out

Hagrid’s next words.

“I jus’ knew ... knew you were like me. ... Was it yer

mother or yer father?”

“I — I don’t know what you mean, ’Agrid. ...”

“It was my mother,” said Hagrid quietly. “She was one

o’ the las’ ones in Britain. ’Course, I can’ remember

her too well ... she left, see. When I was abou’ three.

She wasn’ really the maternal sort. Well ... it’s not in

their natures, is it? Dunno what happened to her ...

might be dead fer all I know. ...”

Madame Maxime didn’t say anything. And Harry, in

spite of himself, took his eyes off the beetle and

looked over the top of the reindeer’s antlers, listening.

. . . He had never heard Hagrid talk about his

childhood before.

“Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen’. Tiny

little bloke, my dad was. By the time I was six I could

lift him up an’ put him on top o’ the dresser if he

annoyed me. Used ter make him laugh. ...” Hagrid’s

deep voice broke. Madame Maxime was listening,

motionless, apparently staring at the silvery fountain.

“Dad raised me ... but he died, o’ course, jus’ after I

started school. Sorta had ter make me own way after

that. Dumbledore was a real help, mind. Very kind ter

me, he was. ...”

Hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief

and blew his nose heavily.

“So ... anyway ... enough abou’ me. What about you?

Which side you got it on?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

But Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.

“It is chilly,” she said — but whatever the weather

was doing, it was nowhere near as cold as her voice.

“I think I will go in now.”

“Eh?” said Hagrid blankly. “No, don’ go! I’ve — I’ve

never met another one before!”

“Anuzzer what, precisely?” said Madame Maxime, her

tone icy.

Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to

answer; he stood there in the shadows gritting his

teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn’t — but it was

no good.

“Another half-giant, o’ course!” said Hagrid.

“ ’Ow dare you!” shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice

exploded through the peaceful night air like a

foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall

out of their rosebush. “I ’ave nevair been more

insulted in my life! ’Alf-giant? Moi? I ’ave — I ’ave big

bones!”

She stormed away; great multicolored swarms of

fairies rose into the air as she passed, angrily pushing

aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the bench,

staring after her. It was much too dark to make out

his expression. Then, after about a minute, he stood

up and strode away, not back to the castle, but off

out into the dark grounds in the direction of his

cabin.

“C’mon,” Harry said, very quietly to Ron. “Let’s go. ...”

But Ron didn’t move.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“What’s up?” said Harry, looking at him.

Ron looked around at Harry, his expression very

serious indeed.

“Did you know?” he whispered. “About Hagrid being

half-giant?”

“No,” Harry said, shrugging. “So what?”

He knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving

him, that he was once again revealing his ignorance

of the wizarding world. Brought up by the Dursleys,

there were many things that wizards took for granted

that were revelations to Harry, but these surprises

had become fewer with each successive year. Now,

however, he could tell that most wizards would not

have said “So what?” upon finding out that one of

their friends had a giantess for a mother.

“I’ll explain inside,” said Ron quietly, “c’mon. ...”

Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably

into a more private clump of bushes. Harry and Ron

returned to the Great Hall. Parvati and Padma were

now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of

Beauxbatons boys, and Hermione was once more

dancing with Krum. Harry and Ron sat down at a

table far removed from the dance floor.

“So?” Harry prompted Ron. “What’s the problem with

giants?”

“Well, they’re ... they’re ...” Ron struggled for words.

"... not very nice,” he finished lamely.

“Who cares?” Harry said. “There’s nothing wrong with

Hagrid!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I know there isn’t, but ... blimey, no wonder he keeps

it quiet,” Ron said, shaking his head. “I always

thought he’d got in the way of a bad Engorgement

Charm when he was a kid or something. Didn’t like to

mention it. ...”

“But what’s it matter if his mother was a giantess?”

said Harry.

“Well ... no one who knows him will care, ’cos they’ll

know he’s not dangerous,” said Ron slowly. “But ...

Harry, they’re just vicious, giants. It’s like Hagrid

said, it’s in their natures, they’re like trolls ... they

just like killing, everyone knows that. There aren’t

any left in Britain now, though.”

“What happened to them?”

“Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got

themselves killed by Aurors. There ’re supposed to be

giants abroad, though. ... They hide out in mountains

mostly. ...”

“I don’t know who Maxime thinks she’s kidding,”

Harry said, watching Madame Maxime sitting alone at

the judges’ table, looking very somber. “If Hagrid ’s

half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones ... the only

thing that’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.”

Harry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing

giants in their corner, neither of them having any

inclination to dance. Harry tried not to watch Cho

and Cedric too much; it gave him a strong desire to

kick something.

When the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight,

everyone gave them a last, loud round of applause

and started to wend their way into the entrance hall.

Many people were expressing the wish that the ball

 

could have gone on longer, but Harry was perfectly

happy to be going to bed; as far as he was concerned,

the evening hadn’t been much fun.

Out in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw

Hermione saying good night to Krum before he went

back to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a very

cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase

without speaking. Harry and Ron followed her, but

halfway up the staircase Harry heard someone calling

him.

“Hey — Harry!”

It was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for

him in the entrance hall below.

“Yeah?” said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs

toward him.

Cedric looked as though he didn’t want to say

whatever it was in front of Ron, who shrugged,

looking bad-tempered, and continued to climb the

stairs.

“Listen ...” Cedric lowered his voice as Ron

disappeared. “I owe you one for telling me about the

dragons. You know that golden egg? Does yours wail

when you open it?”

“Yeah,” said Harry.

“Well ... take a bath, okay?”

“What?”

“Take a bath, and — er — take the egg with you, and

— er — just mull things over in the hot water. It’ll

help you think. ... Trust me.”

 

Harry stared at him.

“Tell you what,” Cedric said, “use the prefects’

bathroom. Fourth door to the left of that statue of

Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password’s

‘pine fresh. ’ Gotta go . . . want to say good night — ”

He grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the

stairs to Cho.

Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That

had been extremely strange advice. Why would a bath

help him to work out what the wailing egg meant?

Was Cedric pulling his leg? Was he trying to make

Harry look like a fool, so Cho would like him even

more by comparison?

The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the

picture over the portrait hole. Harry had to yell “Fairy

lights!” before he woke them up, and when he did,

they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the

common room and found Ron and Hermione having a

blazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they were

bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.

“Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution

is, don’t you?” yelled Hermione; her hair was coming

down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was

screwed up in anger.

“Oh yeah?” Ron yelled back. “What’s that?”

“Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else

does, and not as a last resort!”

Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water

as Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the

girls’ staircase to bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Well,” he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, “well —

that just proves — completely missed the point — ”

Harry didn’t say anything. He liked being back on

speaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind

right now — but he somehow thought that Hermione

had gotten the point much better than Ron had.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

RITA SKEBTER’S SCOOP

Everybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor

common room was much quieter than it had been

lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy

conversations. Hermione’s hair was bushy again; she

confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts

of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for the ball, “but it’s

way too much bother to do every day,” she said

matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks

behind the ears.

Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an

unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument.

They were being quite friendly to each other, though

oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling

Hermione about the conversation they had overheard

between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione

didn’t seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half-

giant nearly as shocking as Ron did.

“Well, I thought he must be,” she said, shrugging. “I

knew he couldn’t be pure giant because they’re about

twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about

 

giants. They can’t all be horrible. ... It’s the same sort

of prejudice that people have toward werewolves. ...

It’s just bigotry, isn’t it?”

Ron looked as though he would have liked to reply

scathingly, but perhaps he didn’t want another row,

because he contented himself with shaking his head

disbelievingly while Hermione wasn’t looking.

It was time now to think of the homework they had

neglected during the first week of the holidays.

Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that

Christmas was over — everybody except Harry, that

is, who was starting (once again) to feel slightly

nervous.

The trouble was that February the twenty-fourth

looked a lot closer from this side of Christmas, and he

still hadn’t done anything about working out the clue

inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the

egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the

dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping

that this time it would make some sense. He strained

to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from

thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything

else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and

opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but

it hadn’t. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting

over all the wailing, but nothing happened. He even

threw the egg across the room — though he hadn’t

really expected that to help.

Harry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had

given him, but his less-than-friendly feelings toward

Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take

his help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seemed to

him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a

hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He,

Harry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in

 

the first task — and Cedric’s idea of a fair exchange

had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn’t

need that sort of rubbishy help — not from someone

who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with

Cho, anyway. And so the first day of the new term

arrived, and Harry set off to lessons, weighed down

with books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also

with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his

stomach, as though he were carrying that around

with him too.

Snow was still thick upon the grounds, and the

greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so

thick that they couldn’t see out of them in Herbology.

Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical

Creatures much in this weather, though as Ron said,

the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely,

either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully

that Hagrid’s cabin would catch fire.

When they arrived at Hagrid’s cabin, however, they

found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair

and a very prominent chin standing before his front

door.

“Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,” she

barked at them as they struggled toward her through

the snow.

“Who ’re you?” said Ron, staring at her. “Where’s

Hagrid?”

“My name is Professor Grubbly-Plank,” she said

briskly. “I am your temporary Care of Magical

Creatures teacher.”

“Where’s Hagrid?” Harry repeated loudly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“He is indisposed,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank

shortly.

Soft and unpleasant laughter reached Harry’s ears.

He turned; Draco Malfoy and the rest of the

Slytherins were joining the class. All of them looked

gleeful, and none of them looked surprised to see

Professor Grubbly-Plank.

“This way, please,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and

she strode off around the paddock where the

Beauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry, Ron, and

Hermione followed her, looking back over their

shoulders at Hagrid’s cabin. All the curtains were

closed. Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill?

“What’s wrong with Hagrid?” Harry said, hurrying to

catch up with Professor Grubbly-Plank.

“Never you mind,” she said as though she thought he

was being nosy.

“I do mind, though,” said Harry hotly. “What’s up with

him?”

Professor Grubbly-Plank acted as though she couldn’t

hear him. She led them past the paddock where the

huge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled

against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the

forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was

tethered.

Many of the girls “ooooohed!” at the sight of the

unicorn.

“Oh it’s so beautiful!” whispered Lavender Brown.

“How did she get it? They’re supposed to be really

hard to catch!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

The unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow

all around look gray. It was pawing the ground

nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back

its horned head.

“Boys keep back!” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank,

throwing out an arm and catching Harry hard in the

chest. “They prefer the woman’s touch, unicorns.

Girls to the front, and approach with care, come on,

easy does it. ...”

She and the girls walked slowly forward toward the

unicorn, leaving the boys standing near the paddock

fence, watching. The moment Professor Grubbly-

Plank was out of earshot, Harry turned to Ron.

“What d’you reckon’s wrong with him? You don’t

think a skrewt — ?”

“Oh he hasn’t been attacked, Potter, if that’s what

you’re thinking,” said Malfoy softly. “No, he’s just too

ashamed to show his big, ugly face.”

“What d’you mean?” said Harry sharply.

Malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes

and pulled out a folded page of newsprint.

“There you go,” he said. “Hate to break it to you,

Potter. ...”

He smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it,

and read it, with Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville

looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped

with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.

DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Albus Dumbledore, eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts

School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been

afraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes

Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. In September of

this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody, the

notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense

Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many

raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic, given

Moody’s well-known habit of attacking anybody who

makes a sudden movement in his presence. Mad-Eye

Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when

set beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to

teach Care of Magical Creatures.

Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from

Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of

gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for

him by Dumbledore. Last year, however, Hagrid used

his mysterious influence over the headmaster to

secure the additional post of Care of Magical

Creatures teacher, over the heads of many better-

qualified candidates.

An alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man,

Hagrid has been using his newfound authority to

terrify the students in his care with a succession of

horrific creatures. While Dumbledore turns a blind

eye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series

of lessons that many admit to being “very

frightening.”

“I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent

Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,” says Draco

Malfoy, a fourth-year student. “We all hate Hagrid,

but we’re just too scared to say anything.”

Hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of

intimidation, however. In conversation with a Daily

Prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding

 

creatures he has dubbed “Blast-Ended Skrewts, ”

highly dangerous crosses between manticores and fire-

crabs. The creation of new breeds of magical creature

is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by

the Department for the Regulation and Control of

Magical Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself

to be above such petty restrictions.

“I was just having some fun,” he says, before hastily

changing the subject.

As if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now

unearthed evidence that Hagrid is not — as he has

always pretended — a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in

fact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively

reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa,

whose whereabouts are currently unknown.

Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought

themselves to the point of extinction by warring

amongst themselves during the last century. The

handful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-

Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some

of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of

terror.

While many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-

Not-Be-Named were killed by Aurors working against

the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is

possible she escaped to one of the giant communities

still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics

during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any

guide, however, Fridwulfa’s son appears to have

inherited her brutal nature.

In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed

a close friendship with the boy who brought around

You-Know- Who’s fall from power — thereby driving

Hagrid ’s own mother, like the rest of You-Know- Who’s

 

supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is

unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large

friend — but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to

ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow

students, is warned about the dangers of associating

with part-giants.

Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose

mouth was hanging open.

“How did she find out?” he whispered.

But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.

“What d’you mean, “we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat

at Malfoy. “What’s this rubbish about him” — he

pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a

flobberworm? They haven’t even got teeth!”

Crabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with

himself.

“Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf’s

teaching career,” said Malfoy, his eyes glinting. “Half-

giant ... and there was me thinking he’d just

swallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young.

... None of the mummies and daddies are going to like

this at all. ... They’ll be worried he’ll eat their kids, ha,

ha. ...”

“You — ”

“Are you paying attention over there?”

Professor Grubbly-Plank’s voice carried over to the

boys; the girls were all clustered around the unicorn

now, stroking it. Harry was so angry that the Daily

Page |486 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to

stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical

properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now

enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could

hear too.

“I hope she stays, that woman!” said Parvati Patil

when the lesson had ended and they were all heading

back to the castle for lunch. “That’s more what I

thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like . . .

proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters. ...”

“What about Hagrid?” Harry said angrily as they went

up the steps.

“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice. “He

can still be gamekeeper, can’t he?”

Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the

ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit

more attention, but she seemed to have had a good

time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody

who would listen that she had made arrangements to

meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the

next weekend trip.

“That was a really good lesson,” said Hermione as

they entered the Great Hall. “I didn’t know half the

things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni — ”

“Look at this!” Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily

Prophet article under Hermione ’s nose.

Hermione ’s mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction

was exactly the same as Ron’s.

“How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You

don’t think Hagrid told her?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“No,” said Harry, leading the way over to the

Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair,

furious. “He never even told us, did he? I reckon she

was so mad he wouldn’t give her loads of horrible

stuff about me, she went ferreting around to get him

back.”

“Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the

ball,” said Hermione quietly.

“We’d have seen her in the garden!” said Ron.

“Anyway, she’s not supposed to come into school

anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her. ...”

“Maybe she’s got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry,

ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing

it everywhere in his anger. “Sort of thing she’d do,

isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.”

“Like you and Ron did, you mean,” said Hermione.

“We weren’t trying to hear him!” said Ron indignantly.

“We didn’t have any choice! The stupid prat, talking

about his giantess mother where anyone could have

heard him!”

“We’ve got to go and see him,” said Harry. “This

evening, after Divination. Tell him we want him back

... you do want him back?” he shot at Hermione.

“I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a

nice change, having a proper Care of Magical

Creatures lesson for once — but I do want Hagrid

back, of course I do!” Hermione added hastily,

quailing under Harry’s furious stare.

So that evening after dinner, the three of them left the

castle once more and went down through the frozen

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

grounds to Hagrid’s cabin. They knocked, and Fang’s

booming barks answered.

“Hagrid, it’s us!” Harry shouted, pounding on the

door. “Open up!

Hagrid didn’t answer. They could hear Fang

scratching at the door, whining, but it didn’t open.

They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even

went and banged on one of the windows, but there

was no response.

“What’s he avoiding us for?” Hermione said when they

had finally given up and were walking back to the

school. “He surely doesn’t think we’d care about him

being half-giant?”

But it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn’t see a

sign of him all week. He didn’t appear at the staff

table at mealtimes, they didn’t see him going about

his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor

Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical

Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every

possible opportunity.

“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to

Harry whenever there was a teacher around, so that

he was safe from Harry’s retaliation. “Missing the

elephant-man?”

There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through

January. Hermione was very surprised that Harry

was going to go.

“I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the

common room being quiet,” she said. “Really get to

work on that egg.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s

about now,” Harry lied.

“Have you really?” said Hermione, looking impressed.

“Well done!”

Harry’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored

them. He still had five weeks to work out that egg

clue, after all, and that was ages ... whereas if he

went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and

get a chance to persuade him to come back.

He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on

Saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds

toward the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang

ship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum

emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but

swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but

apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he

climbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his

arms, and dived, right into the lake.

“He’s mad!” said Harry, staring at Krum’s dark head

as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake. “It must

be freezing, it’s January!”

“It’s a lot colder where he comes from,” said

Hermione. “I suppose it feels quite warm to him.”

“Yeah, but there’s still the giant squid,” said Ron. He

didn’t sound anxious — if anything, he sounded

hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and

frowned.

“He’s really nice, you know,” she said. “He’s not at all

like you’d think, coming from Durmstrang. He likes it

much better here, he told me.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Ron said nothing. He hadn’t mentioned Viktor Krum

since the ball, but Harry had found a miniature arm

under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very

much as though it had been snapped off a small

model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.

Harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all

the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a

visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had

ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.

The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look

around at all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn’t

there. Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with Ron

and Hermione, ordered three butter-beers from

Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he

might just as well have stayed behind and listened to

the egg wailing after all.

“Doesn’t he ever go into the office?” Hermione

whispered suddenly. “Look!”

She pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry

saw Ludo Bagman reflected there, sitting in a

shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins. Bagman was

talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of

whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather

menacing.

It was indeed odd, Harry thought, that Bagman was

here at the Three Broomsticks on a weekend when

there was no Triwizard event, and therefore no

judging to be done. He watched Bagman in the

mirror. He was looking strained again, quite as

strained as he had that night in the forest before the

Dark Mark had appeared. But just then Bagman

glanced over at the bar, saw Harry, and stood up.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“In a moment, in a moment!” Harry heard him say

brusquely to the goblins, and Bagman hurried

through the pub toward Harry, his boyish grin back

in place.

“Harry!” he said. “How are you? Been hoping to run

into you! Everything going all right?”

“Fine, thanks,” said Harry.

“Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?”

said Bagman eagerly. “You couldn’t give us a

moment, you two, could you?”

“Er — okay,” said Ron, and he and Hermione went off

to find a table.

Bagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest

from Madam Rosmerta.

“Well, I just thought I’d congratulate you again on

your splendid performance against that Horntail,

Harry,” said Bagman. “Really superb.”

“Thanks,” said Harry, but he knew this couldn’t be all

that Bagman wanted to say, because he could have

congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione.

Bagman didn’t seem in any particular rush to spill

the beans, though. Harry saw him glance into the

mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all

watching him and Harry in silence through their

dark, slanting eyes.

“Absolute nightmare,” said Bagman to Harry in an

undertone, noticing Harry watching the goblins too.

“Their English isn’t too good ... it’s like being back

with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup ...

but at least they used sign language another human

could recognize. This lot keep gabbling in

 

Gobbledegook . . . and I only know one word of

Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It means ‘pickax.’ I don’t like

to use it in case they think I’m threatening them.”

He gave a short, booming laugh.

“What do they want?” Harry said, noticing how the

goblins were still watching Bagman very closely.

“Er — well ...” said Bagman, looking suddenly

nervous. “They ... er ... they’re looking for Barry

Crouch.”

“Why are they looking for him here?” said Harry. “He’s

at the Ministry in London, isn’t he?”

“Er ... as a matter of fact, I’ve no idea where he is,”

said Bagman. “He’s sort of ... stopped coming to work.

Been absent for a couple of weeks now. Young Percy,

his assistant, says he’s ill. Apparently he’s just been

sending instructions in by owl. But would you mind

not mentioning that to anyone, Harry? Because Rita

Skeeter’s still poking around everywhere she can, and

I’m willing to bet she’d work up Barty’s illness into

something sinister. Probably say he’s gone missing

like Bertha Jorkins.”

“Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?”

Harry asked.

“No,” said Bagman, looking strained again. “I’ve got

people looking, of course ...” (About time, thought

Harry) “and it’s all very strange. She definitely arrived

in Albania, because she met her second cousin there.

And then she left the cousin’s house to go south and

see an aunt . . . and she seems to have vanished

without trace en route. Blowed if I can see where

she’s got to ... she doesn’t seem the type to elope, for

instance ... but still. ... What are we doing, talking

 

about goblins and Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to

ask you” — he lowered his voice — “how are you

getting on with your golden egg?”

“Er ... not bad,” Harry said untruthfully.

Bagman seemed to know he wasn’t being honest.

“Listen, Harry,” he said (still in a very low voice), “I

feel very bad about all this . . . you were thrown into

this tournament, you didn’t volunteer for it... and if

...” (his voice was so quiet now, Harry had to lean

closer to listen) “if I can help at all ... a prod in the

right direction ... I’ve taken a liking to you ... the way

you got past that dragon! ... well, just say the word.”

Harry stared up into Bagman’s round, rosy face and

his wide, baby-blue eyes.

“We’re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren’t

we?” he said, careful to keep his voice casual and not

sound as though he was accusing the head of the

Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking

the rules.

“Well ... well, yes,” said Bagman impatiently, “but —

come on, Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory,

don’t we?”

“Have you offered Cedric help?” Harry said.

The smallest of frowns creased Bagman’s smooth

face. “No, I haven’t,” he said. “I — well, like I say, I’ve

taken a liking to you. Just thought I’d offer ...”

“Well, thanks,” said Harry, “but I think I’m nearly

there with the egg . . . couple more days should crack

it.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

He wasn’t entirely sure why he was refusing

Bagman’s help, except that Bagman was almost a

stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would

feel somehow much more like cheating than asking

advice from Ron, Hermione, or Sirius.

Bagman looked almost affronted, but couldn’t say

much more as Fred and George turned up at that

point.

“Hello, Mr. Bagman,” said Fred brightly. “Can we buy

you a drink?”

“Er ... no,” said Bagman, with a last disappointed

glance at Harry, “no, thank you, boys ...”

Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as

Bagman, who was surveying Harry as though he had

let him down badly.

“Well, I must dash,” he said. “Nice seeing you all.

Good luck, Harry.”

He hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their

chairs and exited after him. Harry went to rejoin Ron

and Hermione.

“What did he want?” Ron said, the moment Harry had

sat down.

“He offered to help me with the golden egg,” said

Harry.

“He shouldn’t be doing that!” said Hermione, looking

very shocked. “He’s one of the judges! And anyway,

you’ve already worked it out — haven’t you?”

“Er ... nearly,” said Harry.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Well, I don’t think Dumbledore would like it if he

knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!”

said Hermione, still looking deeply disapproving. “I

hope he’s trying to help Cedric as much!”

“He’s not, I asked,” said Harry.

“Who cares if Diggory’s getting help?” said Ron. Harry

privately agreed.

“Those goblins didn’t look very friendly,” said

Hermione, sipping her butterbeer. “What were they

doing here?”

“Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman,” said

Harry. “He’s still ill. Hasn’t been into work.”

“Maybe Percy’s poisoning him,” said Ron. “Probably

thinks if Crouch snuffs it he’ll be made head of the

Department of International Magical Cooperation.”

Hermione gave Ron a don’t -joke-about-things-like-

that look, and said, “Funny, goblins looking for Mr.

Crouch. . . . They’d normally deal with the Department

for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.”

“Crouch can speak loads of different languages,

though,” said Harry. “Maybe they need an

interpreter.”

“Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you?”

Ron asked Hermione. “Thinking of starting up

S.P.U.G. or something? Society for the Protection of

Ugly Goblins?”

“Ha, ha, ha,” said Hermione sarcastically. “Goblins

don’t need protection. Haven’t you been listening to

what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin

rebellions?”

 

“No,” said Harry and Ron together.

“Well, they’re quite capable of dealing with wizards,”

said Hermione, taking another sip of butterbeer.

“They’re very clever. They’re not like house-elves, who

never stick up for themselves.”

“Uh-oh,” said Ron, staring at the door.

Rita Skeeter had just entered. She was wearing

banana-yellow robes today; her long nails were

painted shocking pink, and she was accompanied by

her paunchy photographer. She bought drinks, and

she and the photographer made their way through

the crowds to a table nearby, Harry, Ron, and

Hermione glaring at her as she approached. She was

talking fast and looking very satisfied about

something.

"... didn’t seem very keen to talk to us, did he, Bozo?

Now, why would that be, do you think? And what’s he

doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway? Showing

them the sights . . . what nonsense ... he was always a

bad liar. Reckon something’s up? Think we should do

a bit of digging? ‘Disgraced Ex-Head of Magical

Games and Sports, Ludo Bagman ...’ Snappy start to

a sentence, Bozo — we just need to find a story to fit

it — ”

“Trying to ruin someone else’s life?” said Harry loudly.

A few people looked around. Rita Skeeter ’s eyes

widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw

who had spoken.

“Harry!” she said, beaming. “How lovely! Why don’t

you come and join — ?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I wouldn’t come near you with a ten-foot

broomstick,” said Harry furiously. “What did you do

that to Hagrid for, eh?”

Rita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows.

“Our readers have a right to the truth, Harry. I am

merely doing my — ”

“Who cares if he’s half- giant?” Harry shouted. “There’s

nothing wrong with him!”

The whole pub had gone very quiet. Madam Rosmerta

was staring over from behind the bar, apparently

oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling

with mead was overflowing.

Rita Skeeter’s smile flickered very slightly, but she

hitched it back almost at once; she snapped open her

crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out her Quick-Quotes

Quill, and said, “How about giving me an interview

about the Hagrid you know, Harry? The man behind

the muscles? Your unlikely friendship and the

reasons behind it. Would you call him a father

substitute?”

Hermione stood up very abruptly, her butterbeer

clutched in her hand as though it were a grenade.

“You horrible woman,” she said, through gritted teeth,

“you don’t care, do you, anything for a story, and

anyone will do, won’t they? Even Ludo Bagman — ”

“Sit down, you silly little girl, and don’t talk about

things you don’t understand,” said Rita Skeeter

coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on Hermione. “I

know things about Ludo Bagman that would make

your hair curl . . . not that it needs it — ” she added,

eyeing Hermione ’s bushy hair.

 

“Let’s go,” said Hermione, “c’mon, Harry — Ron ...”

They left; many people were staring at them as they

went. Harry glanced back as they reached the door.

Rita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill was out; it was

zooming backward and forward over a piece of

parchment on the table.

“She’ll be after you next, Hermione,” said Ron in a low

and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the

street.

“Let her try!” said Hermione defiantly; she was

shaking with rage. “I’ll show her! Silly little girl, am I?

Oh, I’ll get her back for this. First Harry, then Hagrid

“You don’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,” said

Ron nervously. “I’m serious, Hermione, she’ll dig up

something on you — ”

“My parents don’t read the Daily Prophet She can’t

scare me into hiding!” said Hermione, now striding

along so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could do to

keep up with her. The last time Harry had seen

Hermione in a rage like this, she had hit Draco Malfoy

around the face. “And Hagrid isn’t hiding anymore!

He should never have let that excuse for a human

being upset him! Come on!”

Breaking into a run, she led them all the way back up

the road, through the gates flanked by winged boars,

and up through the grounds to Hagrid ’s cabin.

The curtains were still drawn, and they could hear

Fang barking as they approached.

“Hagrid!” Hermione shouted, pounding on his front

door. “Hagrid, that’s enough! We know you’re in there!

 

Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess, Hagrid!

You can’t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you!

Hagrid, get out here, you’re just being — ”

The door opened. Hermione said, “About t — !” and

then stopped, very suddenly, because she had found

herself face-to-face, not with Hagrid, but with Albus

Dumbledore.

“Good afternoon,” he said pleasantly, smiling down at

them.

“We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid,” said Hermione

in a rather small voice.

“Yes, I surmised as much,” said Dumbledore, his eyes

twinkling. “Why don’t you come in?”

“Oh ... um ... okay,” said Hermione.

She, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang

launched himself upon Harry the moment he entered,

barking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry

fended off Fang and looked around.

Hagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two

large mugs of tea. He looked a real mess. His face was

blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the

other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from

trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of

tangled wire.

“Hi, Hagrid,” said Harry.

Hagrid looked up.

“ ’Lo,” he said in a very hoarse voice.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“More tea, I think,” said Dumbledore, closing the door

behind Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his

wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared

in midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore

magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat

down. There was a slight pause, and then

Dumbledore said, “Did you by any chance hear what

Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?”

Hermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled

at her and continued, “Hermione, Harry, and Ron still

seem to want to know you, judging by the way they

were attempting to break down the door.”

“Of course we still want to know you!” Harry said,

staring at Hagrid. “You don’t think anything that

Skeeter cow — sorry, Professor,” he added quickly,

looking at Dumbledore.

“I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea

what you said, Harry,” said Dumbledore, twiddling

his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.

“Er — right,” said Harry sheepishly. “I just meant —

Hagrid, how could you think we’d care what that —

woman — wrote about you?”

Two fat tears leaked out of Hagrid ’s beetle-black eyes

and fell slowly into his tangled beard.

“Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, Hagrid,”

said Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the

ceiling. “I have shown you the letters from the

countless parents who remember you from their own

days here, telling me in no uncertain terms that if I

sacked you, they would have something to say about

it — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Not all of ’em,” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Not all of ’em

wan’ me ter stay.”

“Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal

popularity, I’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a

very long time,” said Dumbledore, now peering sternly

over his half-moon spectacles. “Not a week has

passed since I became headmaster of this school

when I haven’t had at least one owl complaining

about the way I run it. But what should I do?

Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to

anybody?”

“Yeh — yeh’re not half-giant!” said Hagrid croakily.

“Hagrid, look what I’ve got for relatives!” Harry said

furiously. “Look at the Dursleys!”

“An excellent point,” said Professor Dumbledore. “My

own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing

inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the

papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He

held his head high and went about his business as

usual! Of course, I’m not entirely sure he can read, so

that may not have been bravery. ...”

“Come back and teach, Hagrid,” said Hermione

quietly, “please come back, we really miss you.”

Hagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks

and into his tangled beard.

Dumbledore stood up. “I refuse to accept your

resignation, Hagrid, and I expect you back at work on

Monday,” he said. “You will join me for breakfast at

eight-thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good

afternoon to you all.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Dumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch

Fang’s ears. When the door had shut behind him,

Hagrid began to sob into his dustbin-lid-sized hands.

Hermione kept patting his arm, and at last, Hagrid

looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, “Great

man, Dumbledore ... great man ...”

“Yeah, he is,” said Ron. “Can I have one of these

cakes, Hagrid?”

“Help yerself,” said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the

back of his hand. “Ar, he’s righ’, o’ course — yeh’re all

righ’ ... I bin stupid ... my ol’ dad woulda bin

ashamed o’ the way I’ve bin behavin’. ...” More tears

leaked out, but he wiped them away more forcefully,

and said, “Never shown you a picture of my old dad,

have I? Here ...”

Hagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a

drawer, and pulled out a picture of a short wizard

with Hagrid’s crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat

on top of Hagrid’s shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven

or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him,

but his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth

— he looked hardly older than eleven.

“Tha’ was taken jus’ after I got inter Hogwarts,”

Hagrid croaked. “Dad was dead chuffed ... thought I

migh’ not be a wizard, see, ’cos me mum ... well,

anyway. ’Course, I never was great shakes at magic,

really ... but at least he never saw me expelled. Died,

see, in me second year. ...

“Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after

Dad went. Got me the gamekeeper job ... trusts

people, he does. Gives ’em second chances ... tha’s

what sets him apar’ from other heads, see. He’ll

accept anyone at Hogwarts, s’long as they’ve got the

talent. Knows people can turn out okay even if their

 

families weren’ ... well ... all tha’ respectable. But

some don’ understand that. There’s some who’d

always hold it against yeh ... there’s some who’d even

pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up

an’ say — I am what I am, an’ I’m not ashamed.

‘Never be ashamed,’ my ol’ dad used ter say, ‘there’s

some wholl hold it against you, but they’re not worth

botherin’ with.’ An’ he was right. I’ve bin an idiot. I’m

not botherin’ with her no more, I promise yeh that.

Big bones ... I’ll give her big bones.”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another

nervously; Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast-

Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid that

he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime,

but Hagrid was still talking, apparently unaware that

he had said anything odd.

“Yeh know wha’, Harry?” he said, looking up from the

photograph of his father, his eyes very bright, “when I

firs’ met you, you reminded me o’ me a bit. Mum an’

Dad gone, an’ you was feelin’ like yeh wouldn’ fit in at

Hogwarts, remember? Not sure yeh were really up to

it ... an’ now look at yeh, Harry! School champion!”

He looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very

seriously, “Yeh know what I’d love, Harry? I’d love yeh

ter win, I really would. It’d show ’em all ... yeh don’

have ter be pureblood ter do it. Yeh don’ have ter be

ashamed of what yeh are. It’d show ’em Dumbledore’s

the one who’s got it righ’, lettin’ anyone in as long as

they can do magic. How you doin’ with that egg,

Harry?”

“Great,” said Harry. “Really great.”

Hagrid ’s miserable face broke into a wide, watery

smile.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Tha’s my boy ... you show ’em, Harry, you show ’em.

Beat ’em all.”

Lying to Hagrid wasn’t quite like lying to anyone else.

Harry went back to the castle later that afternoon

with Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the image

of the happy expression on Hagrid’s whiskery face as

he had imagined Harry winning the tournament. The

incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever

on Harry’s conscience that evening, and by the time

he had got into bed, he had made up his mind — it

was time to shelve his pride and see if Cedric’s hint

was worth anything.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE EGG AND THE EYE

As Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need

to work out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to

do it at night, when he would be able to take as much

time as he wanted. Reluctant though he was to accept

more favours from Cedric, he also decided to use the

prefects’ bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in

there, so it was much less likely that he would be

disturbed.

Harry planned his excursion carefully, because he

had been caught out of bed and out-of-bounds by

Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once

before, and had no desire to repeat the experience.

The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential,

and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would

take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the cloak,

was the most useful aid to rule-breaking Harry

owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts,

including its many shortcuts and secret passageways

and, most important of all, it revealed the people

inside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving

around the corridors, so that Harry would be

 

forewarned if somebody was approaching the

bathroom.

On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on

the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had

done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the

dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This

time it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat

Lady the password (“banana fritters”). “Good luck,”

Ron muttered, climbing into the room as Harry crept

out past him.

It was awkward moving under the cloak tonight,

because Harry had the heavy egg under one arm and

the map held in front of his nose with the other.

However, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent,

and by checking the map at strategic intervals, Harry

was able to ensure that he wouldn’t run into anyone

he wanted to avoid. When he reached the statue of

Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his

gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door,

leaned close to it, and muttered the password, “Pine

fresh,” just as Cedric had told him.

The door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted

the door behind him, and pulled off the Invisibility

Cloak, looking around.

His immediate reaction was that it would be worth

becoming a prefect just to be able to use this

bathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled

chandelier, and everything was made of white marble,

including what looked like an empty, rectangular

swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor.

About a hundred golden taps stood all around the

pool’s edges, each with a differently colored jewel set

into its handle. There was also a diving board. Long

white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile

of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a

 

single golden-framed painting on the wall. It featured

a blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her

long hair over her face. It fluttered every time she

snored.

Harry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps

echoing off the walls. Magnificent though the

bathroom was — and quite keen though he was to try

out a few of those taps — now he was here he

couldn’t quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might

have been having him on. How on earth was this

supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg?

Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, the

cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the

swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and

turned on a few of the taps.

He could tell at once that they carried different sorts

of bubble bath mixed with the water, though it wasn’t

bubble bath as Harry had ever experienced it. One

tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of

footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that

Harry thought it would have supported his weight if

he’d cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed

purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water.

Harry amused himself for a while turning the taps on

and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose

jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs.

Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam,

and bubbles, which took a very short time

considering its size, Harry turned off all the taps,

pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown,

and slid into the water.

It was so deep that his feet barely touched the

bottom, and he actually did a couple of lengths before

swimming back to the side and treading water,

staring at the egg. Highly enjoyable though it was to

swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different-

 

colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of

brilliance came to him, no sudden burst of

understanding.

Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet

hands, and opened it. The wailing, screeching sound

filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the

marble walls, but it sounded just as

incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the

echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the

sound would attract Filch, wondering whether that

hadn’t been Cedric’s plan — and then, making him

jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which

clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone

spoke.

“I’d try putting it in the water, if I were you.”

Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of

bubbles in shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw

the ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-

legged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning

Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S-

bend of a toilet three floors below.

“Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage, “I’m — I’m not

wearing anything!”

The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but

he had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on

him from out of one of the taps ever since he had

arrived.

“I closed my eyes when you got in,” she said, blinking

at him through her thick spectacles. “You haven’t

been to see me for ages.”

“Yeah ... well ...” said Harry, bending his knees

slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn’t

 

see anything but his head, “I’m not supposed to come

into your bathroom, am I? It’s a girls’ one.”

“You didn’t used to care,” said Myrtle miserably. “You

used to be in there all the time.”

This was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and

Hermione had found Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a

convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret —

a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into

living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so

that they could sneak into the Slytherin common

room.

“I got told off for going in there,” said Harry, which

was half-true; Percy had once caught him coming out

of Myrtle’s bathroom. “I thought I’d better not come

back after that.”

“Oh ... I see ...” said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her

chin in a morose sort of way. “Well... anyway ... I’d try

the egg in the water. That’s what Cedric Diggory did.”

“Have you been spying on him too?” said Harry

indignantly. “What d’you do, sneak up here in the

evenings to watch the prefects take baths?”

“Sometimes,” said Myrtle, rather slyly, “but I’ve never

come out to speak to anyone before.”

“I’m honored,” said Harry darkly. “You keep your eyes

shut!”

He made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered

before hoisting himself out of the bath, wrapping the

towel firmly around his waist, and going to retrieve

the egg. Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered

through her fingers and said, “Go on, then . . . open it

under the water!”

 

Harry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and

opened it ... and this time, it did not wail. A gurgling

song was coming out of it, a song whose words he

couldn’t distinguish through the water.

“You need to put your head under too,” said Myrtle,

who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him

around. “Go on!”

Harry took a great breath and slid under the surface

— and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the

bubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices

singing to him from the open egg in his hands:

“Come seek us where our voices sound,

We cannot sing above the ground,

And while you’re searching ponder this:

We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss,

An hour long you’ll have to look,

And to recover what we took,

But past an hour — the prospect’s black,

Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.”

Harry let himself float back upward and broke the

bubbly surface, shaking his hair out of his eyes.

“Hear it?” said Myrtle.

“Yeah ... ‘Come seek us where our voices sound ...’

and if I need persuading . . . hang on, I need to listen

again. ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

He sank back beneath the water. It took three more

underwater renditions of the egg’s song before Harry

had it memorized; then he trod water for a while,

thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him.

“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their

voices above the ground. ...” he said slowly. “Er ...

who could that be?”

“Slow, aren’t you?”

He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart

from the day when a dose of Polyjuice Potion had

given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat. Harry

stared around the bathroom, thinking ... if the voices

could only be heard underwater, then it made sense

for them to belong to underwater creatures. He ran

this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.

“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay

there talking to himself for ages about it. Ages and

ages ... nearly all the bubbles had gone. ...”

“Underwater ...” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle ... what

lives in the lake, apart from the giant squid?”

“Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there

... sometimes don’t have any choice, if someone

flushes my toilet when I’m not expecting it. ...”

Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming

down a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet,

Harry said, “Well, does anything in there have a

human voice? Hang on — ”

Harry’s eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing

mermaid on the wall.

“Myrtle, there aren’t merpeople in there, are there?”

 

“Oooh, very good,” she said, her thick glasses

twinkling, “it took Diggory much longer than that!

And that was with her awake too” — Myrtle jerked her

head toward the mermaid with an expression of great

dislike on her glum face — “giggling and showing off

and flashing her fins. ...”

“That’s it, isn’t it?” said Harry excitedly. “The second

task’s to go and find the merpeople in the lake and . . .

and ...”

But he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he

felt the excitement drain out of him as though

someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach. He

wasn’t a very good swimmer; he’d never had much

practice. Dudley had had lessons in his youth, but

Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping

that Harry would drown one day, hadn’t bothered to

give him any. A couple of lengths of this bath were all

very well, but that lake was very large, and very deep

. . . and merpeople would surely live right at the

bottom. ...

“Myrtle,” Harry said slowly, “how am I supposed to

breathe ?”

At this, Myrtle’s eyes filled with sudden tears again.

“Tactless!” she muttered, groping in her robes for a

handkerchief.

“What’s tactless?” said Harry, bewildered.

“Talking about breathing in front of me!” she said

shrilly, and her voice echoed loudly around the

bathroom. “When I can’t ... when I haven’t ... not for

ages ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed

loudly. Harry remembered how touchy Myrtle had

always been about being dead, but none of the other

ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it.

“Sorry,” he said impatiently. “I didn’t mean — I just

forgot ...”

“Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle’s dead,” said

Myrtle, gulping, looking at him out of swollen eyes.

“Nobody missed me even when I was alive. Took them

hours and hours to find my body — I know, I was

sitting there waiting for them. Olive Hornby came into

the bathroom — ‘Are you in here again, sulking,

Myrtle?’ she said, ‘because Professor Dippet asked me

to look for you — ’ And then she saw my body . . .

ooooh, she didn’t forget it until her dying day, I made

sure of that . . . followed her around and reminded her,

I did. I remember at her brother’s wedding — ”

But Harry wasn’t listening; he was thinking about the

merpeople’s song again. “We’ve taken what you’ll

sorely miss.” That sounded as though they were going

to steal something of his, something he had to get

back. What were they going to take?

“ — and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of

Magic to stop me stalking her, so I had to come back

here and live in my toilet.”

“Good,” said Harry vaguely. “Well, I’m a lot further on

than I was. ... Shut your eyes again, will you? I’m

getting out.”

He retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath,

climbed out, dried himself, and pulled on his pajamas

and dressing gown again.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again

sometime?” Moaning Myrtle asked mournfully as

Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.

“Er ... I’ll try,” Harry said, though privately thinking

the only way he’d be visiting Myrtle’s bathroom again

was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked. “See

you, Myrtle ... thanks for your help.”

“ ’Bye, ’bye,” she said gloomily, and as Harry put on

the Invisibility Cloak he saw her zoom back up the

tap.

Out in the dark corridor, Harry examined the

Marauder’s Map to check that the coast was still

clear. Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his cat,

Mrs. Norris, were safely in their office ... nothing else

seemed to be moving apart from Peeves, though he

was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor

above. ... Harry had taken his first step back toward

Gryffindor Tower when something else on the map

caught his eye ... something distinctly odd.

Peeves was not the only thing that was moving. A

single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom

left-hand corner — Snape’s office. But the dot wasn’t

labeled “Severus Snape” ... it was Bartemius Crouch.

Harry stared at the dot. Mr. Crouch was supposed to

be too ill to go to work or to come to the Yule Ball —

so what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one

o’clock in the morning? Harry watched closely as the

dot moved around and around the room, pausing

here and there. ...

Harry hesitated, thinking . . . and then his curiosity got

the better of him. He turned and set off in the

opposite direction toward the nearest staircase. He

was going to see what Crouch was up to.

 

Harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible,

though the faces in some of the portraits still turned

curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of

his pajamas. He crept along the corridor below,

pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and

proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that

would take him down two floors. He kept glancing

down at the map, wondering ... It just didn’t seem in

character, somehow, for correct, law-abiding Mr.

Crouch to be sneaking around somebody else’s office

this late at night. ...

And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking

about what he was doing, not concentrating on

anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch,

Harry’s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step

Neville always forgot to jump. He gave an ungainly

wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath,

slipped from under his arm. He lurched forward to try

and catch it, but too late; the egg fell down the long

staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on

every step — the Invisibility Cloak slipped — Harry

snatched at it, and the Marauder’s Map fluttered out

of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in

the step to above his knee, he couldn’t reach it.

The golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom

of the staircase, burst open, and began wailing loudly

in the corridor below. Harry pulled out his wand and

struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it

blank, but it was too far away to reach —

Pulling the cloak back over himself Harry

straightened up, listening hard with his eyes screwed

up with fear ... and, almost immediately —

“PEEVES!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

It was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the

caretaker. Harry could hear his rapid, shuffling

footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice

raised in fury.

“What’s this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will

you? I’ll have you, Peeves, I’ll have you, you’ll ... and

what is this?”

Filch ’s footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on

metal and the wailing stopped — Filch had picked up

the egg and closed it. Harry stood very still, one leg

still jammed tightly in the magical step, listening. Any

moment now, Filch was going to pull aside the

tapestry, expecting to see Peeves . . . and there would

be no Peeves ... but if he came up the stairs, he would

spot the Marauder’s Map ... and Invisibility Cloak or

not, the map would show “Harry Potter” standing

exactly where he was.

“Egg?” Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. “My

sweet!” — Mrs. Norris was obviously with him — “This

is a Triwizard clue! This belongs to a school

champion!”

Harry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast —

“PEEVES!” Filch roared gleefully. “You’ve been

stealing!”

He ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his

horrible, pouchy face and bulging, pale eyes staring

up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase.

“Hiding, are you?” he said softly. “I’m coming to get

you, Peeves. ... You’ve gone and stolen a Tri wizard

clue, Peeves. ... Dumbledore’ll have you out of here

for this, you filthy, pilfering poltergeist. ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Filch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-

colored cat at his heels. Mrs. Norris’s lamp-like eyes,

so very like her master’s, were fixed directly upon

Harry. He had had occasion before now to wonder

whether the Invisibility Cloak worked on cats. ... Sick

with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer

and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown — he

tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free, but it

merely sank a few more inches — any second now,

Filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him

“Filch? What’s going on?”

Filch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At

the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could

make Harry’s situation worse: Snape. He was wearing

a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid.

“It’s Peeves, Professor,” Filch whispered malevolently.

“He threw this egg down the stairs.”

Snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped

beside Filch. Harry gritted his teeth, convinced his

loudly thumping heart would give him away at any

second. ...

“Peeves?” said Snape softly, staring at the egg in

Filch’s hands. “But Peeves couldn’t get into my office.

“This egg was in your office, Professor?”

“Of course not,” Snape snapped. “I heard banging and

wailing — ”

“Yes, Professor, that was the egg — ”

“ — I was coming to investigate — ”

 

“ — Peeves threw it, Professor — ”

“ — and when I passed my office, I saw that the

torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar!

Somebody has been searching it!”

“But Peeves couldn’t — ”

“I know he couldn’t, Filch!” Snape snapped again. “I

seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could

break!” Snape looked up the stairs, straight through

Harry, and then down into the corridor below. “I want

you to come and help me search for the intruder,

Filch.”

“I — yes, Professor — but — ”

Filch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through

Harry, who could see that he was very reluctant to

forgo the chance of cornering Peeves. Go, Harry

pleaded with him silently, go with Snape ... go ... Mrs.

Norris was peering around Filch ’s legs. ... Harry had

the distinct impression that she could smell him. ...

Why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed

foam?

“The thing is, Professor,” said Filch plaintively, “the

headmaster will have to listen to me this time. Peeves

has been stealing from a student, it might be my

chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and

for all — ”

“Filch, I don’t give a damn about that wretched

poltergeist; it’s my office that’s — ”

Clunk. Clunk. Clunk.

Snape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch

both looked down at the foot of the stairs. Harry saw

 

Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow

gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old

traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his

staff as usual.

“Pajama party, is it?” he growled up the stairs.

“Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,” said

Filch at once. “Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things

around as usual — and then Professor Snape

discovered that someone had broken into his off — ”

“Shut up!” Snape hissed to Filch.

Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs.

Harry saw Moody’s magical eye travel over Snape, and

then, unmistakably, onto himself.

Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see

through Invisibility Cloaks ... he alone could see the

full strangeness of the scene: Snape in his nightshirt,

Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the

stairs behind them. Moody’s lopsided gash of a mouth

opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry

stared straight into each other’s eyes. Then Moody

closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape

again.

“Did I hear that correctly, Snape?” he asked slowly.

“Someone broke into your office?”

“It is unimportant,” said Snape coldly.

“On the contrary,” growled Moody, “it is very

important. Who’d want to break into your office?”

“A student, I daresay,” said Snape. Harry could see a

vein flickering horribly on Snape ’s greasy temple. “It

has happened before. Potion ingredients have gone

 

missing from my private store cupboard ... students

attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt. ...”

“Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?” said

Moody. “Not hiding anything else in your office, are

you?”

Harry saw the edge of Snape ’s sallow face turn a

nasty brick color, the vein in his temple pulsing more

rapidly.

“You know I’m hiding nothing, Moody,” he said in a

soft and dangerous voice, “as you’ve searched my

office pretty thoroughly yourself.”

Moody’s face twisted into a smile. “Auror’s privilege,

Snape. Dumbledore told me to keep an eye — ”

“Dumbledore happens to trust me,” said Snape

through clenched teeth. “I refuse to believe that he

gave you orders to search my office!”

“ ’Course Dumbledore trusts you,” growled Moody.

“He’s a trusting man, isn’t he? Believes in second

chances. But me — I say there are spots that don’t

come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d’you

know what I mean?”

Snape suddenly did something very strange. He

seized his left forearm convulsively with his right

hand, as though something on it had hurt him.

Moody laughed. “Get back to bed, Snape.”

“You don’t have the authority to send me anywhere!”

Snape hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry

with himself. “I have as much right to prowl this

school after dark as you do!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Prowl away,” said Moody, but his voice was full of

menace. “I look forward to meeting you in a dark

corridor some time. ... You’ve dropped something, by

the way. ...”

With a stab of horror, Harry saw Moody point at the

Marauder’s Map, still lying on the staircase six steps

below him. As Snape and Filch both turned to look at

it, Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised his

arms under the cloak and waved furiously at Moody

to attract his attention, mouthing “It’s mine! Mine!”

Snape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of

dawning comprehension on his face —

“Accio Parchments

The map flew up into the air, slipped through Snape ’s

outstretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into

Moody’s hand.

“My mistake,” Moody said calmly. “It’s mine —

must’ve dropped it earlier — ”

But Snape ’s black eyes were darting from the egg in

Filch’s arms to the map in Moody’s hand, and Harry

could tell he was putting two and two together, as

only Snape could. ...

“Potter,” he said quietly.

“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map

and pocketing it.

“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his

head and stared right at the place where Harry was,

as though he could suddenly see him. “That egg is

Potter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Potter. I have seen it before, I recognize it! Potter is

here! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!”

Snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and

began to move up the stairs; Harry could have sworn

his over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff

Harry out — trapped, Harry leaned backward, trying

to avoid Snape’s fingertips, but any moment now —

“There’s nothing there, Snape!” barked Moody, “but

I’ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your

mind jumped to Harry Potter!”

“Meaning what?” Snape turned again to look at

Moody, his hands still outstretched, inches from

Harry’s chest.

“Meaning that Dumbledore’s very interested to know

who’s got it in for that boy!” said Moody, limping

nearer still to the foot of the stairs. “And so am I,

Snape ... very interested. ...” The torchlight flickered

across his mangled face, so that the scars, and the

chunk missing from his nose, looked deeper and

darker than ever.

Snape was looking down at Moody, and Harry

couldn’t see the expression on his face. For a

moment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape

slowly lowered his hands.

“I merely thought,” said Snape, in a voice of forced

calm, “that if Potter was wandering around after

hours again ... it’s an unfortunate habit of his ... he

should be stopped. For — for his own safety.”

“Ah, I see,” said Moody softly. “Got Potter’s best

interests at heart, have you?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

There was a pause. Snape and Moody were still

staring at each other. Mrs. Norris gave a loud meow,

still peering around Filch’s legs, looking for the source

of Harry’s bubble-bath smell.

“I think I will go back to bed,” Snape said curtly.

“Best idea you’ve had all night,” said Moody. “Now,

Filch, if you’ll just give me that egg — ”

“No!” said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were

his firstborn son. “Professor Moody, this is evidence of

Peeves’ treachery!”

“It’s the property of the champion he stole it from,”

said Moody. “Hand it over, now.”

Snape swept downstairs and passed Moody without

another word. Filch made a chirruping noise to Mrs.

Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few more

seconds before turning and following her master. Still

breathing very fast, Harry heard Snape walking away

down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and

disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris.

“Never mind, my sweet ... we’ll see Dumbledore in the

morning ... tell him what Peeves was up to. ...”

A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at

Moody, who placed his staff on the bottommost stair

and started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull

clunk on every other step.

“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.

“Yeah ... I — er ... thanks,” said Harry weakly.

“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the

Marauders Map out of his pocket and unfolding it.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was

going to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg

was really hurting him.

“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the

map, his magical eye going haywire. “This ... this is

some map, Potter!”

“Yeah, it’s ... quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were

starting to water from the pain. “Er — Professor

Moody, d’you think you could help me — ?”

“What? Oh! Yes ... yes, of course ...”

Moody took hold of Harry’s arms and pulled; Harry’s

leg came free of the trick step, and he climbed onto

the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the map.

“Potter ...” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any

chance, to see who broke into Snape’s office, did you?

On this map, I mean?”

“Er ... yeah, I did ...” Harry admitted. “It was Mr.

Crouch.”

Moody’s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of

the map. He looked suddenly alarmed.

“Crouch?” he said. “You’re — you’re sure, Potter?”

“Positive,” said Harry.

“Well, he’s not here anymore,” said Moody, his eye

still whizzing over the map. “Crouch ... that’s very —

very interesting. ...”

He said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at

the map. Harry could tell that this news meant

something to Moody and very much wanted to know

 

what it was. He wondered whether he dared ask.

Moody scared him slightly ... yet Moody had just

helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble. ...

“Er ... Professor Moody ... why d’you reckon Mr.

Crouch wanted to look around S nape’s office?”

Moody’s magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering,

upon Harry. It was a penetrating glare, and Harry had

the impression that Moody was sizing him up,

wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to

tell him.

“Put it this way, Potter,” Moody muttered finally, “they

say old Mad-Eye’s obsessed with catching Dark

wizards ... but I’m nothing — nothing — compared to

Barty Crouch.”

He continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning

to know more.

“Professor Moody?” he said again. “D’you think ...

could this have anything to do with . . . maybe Mr.

Crouch thinks there’s something going on. ...”

“Like what?” said Moody sharply.

Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn’t

want Moody to guess that he had a source of

information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to

tricky questions about Sirius.

“I don’t know,” Harry muttered, “odd stuff’s been

happening lately, hasn’t it? It’s been in the Daily

Prophet ... the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the

Death Eaters and everything. ...”

Both of Moody’s mismatched eyes widened.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You’re a sharp boy, Potter,” he said. His magical eye

roved back to the Marauder’s Map. “Crouch could be

thinking along those lines,” he said slowly. “Very

possible ... there have been some funny rumors flying

around lately — helped along by Rita Skeeter, of

course. It’s making a lot of people nervous, I reckon.”

A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth. “Oh if

there’s one thing I hate,” he muttered, more to himself

than to Harry, and his magical eye was fixed on the

left-hand corner of the map, “it’s a Death Eater who

walked free. ...”

Harry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean

what Harry thought he meant?

“And now I want to ask you a question, Potter,” said

Moody in a more businesslike tone.

Harry’s heart sank; he had thought this was coming.

Moody was going to ask where he had got this map,

which was a very dubious magical object — and the

story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated

not only him, but his own father, Fred and George

Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defense

Against the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the map

in front of Harry, who braced himself —

“Can I borrow this?”

“Oh!” said Harry.

He was very fond of his map, but on the other hand,

he was extremely relieved that Moody wasn’t asking

where he’d got it, and there was no doubt that he

owed Moody a favor.

“Yeah, okay.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Good boy,” growled Moody. “I can make good use of

this ... this might be exactly what I’ve been looking

for. ... Right, bed, Potter, come on, now. ...”

They climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody

still examining the map as though it was a treasure

the like of which he had never seen before. They

walked in silence to the door of Moody’s office, where

he stopped and looked up at Harry.

“You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?”

“No,” said Harry, taken aback.

“You want to consider it,” said Moody, nodding and

looking at Harry thoughtfully. “Yes, indeed ... and

incidentally ... I’m guessing you weren’t just taking

that egg for a walk tonight?”

“Er — no,” said Harry, grinning. “I’ve been working

out the clue.”

Moody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire

again.

“Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas,

Potter. ... See you in the morning. ...”

He went back into his office, staring down at the

Marauder’s Map again, and closed the door behind

him.

Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in

thought about Snape, and Crouch, and what it all

meant. ... Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he

could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to?

What did he think Snape was concealing in his office?

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

And Moody thought he, Harry, ought to be an Auror!

Interesting idea . . . but somehow, Harry thought, as

he got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later,

the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, he

thought he’d like to check how scarred the rest of

them were before he chose it as a career.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE SECOND TASK

“You said you’d already worked out that egg clue!”

said Hermione indignantly.

“Keep your voice down!” said Harry crossly. “I just

need to — sort of fine-tune it, all right?”

He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back

of the Charms class with a table to themselves. They

were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the

Summoning Charm today — the Banishing Charm.

Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when

objects kept flying across the room, Professor Flitwick

had given each student a stack of cushions on which

to practice, the theory being that these wouldn’t hurt

anyone if they went off target. It was a good theory,

but it wasn’t working very well. Neville’s aim was so

poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier

things flying across the room — Professor Flitwick, for

instance.

“Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?” Harry

hissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly

 

past them, landing on top of a large cabinet. “I’m

trying to tell you about Snape and Moody. ...”

This class was an ideal cover for a private

conversation, as everyone was having far too much

fun to pay them any attention. Harry had been

recounting his adventures of the previous night in

whispered installments for the last half hour.

“Snape said Moody’s searched his office as well?” Ron

whispered, his eyes alight with interest as he

Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it

soared into the air and knocked Parvati’s hat off).

“What ... d’you reckon Moody’s here to keep an eye on

Snape as well as Karkaroff?”

“Well, I dunno if that’s what Dumbledore asked him

to do, but he’s definitely doing it,” said Harry, waving

his wand without paying much attention, so that his

cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk.

“Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here

because he’s giving him a second chance or

something. ...”

“What?” said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion

spinning high into the air, ricocheting off the

chandelier, and dropping heavily onto Flitwick’s desk.

“Harry . . . maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name

in the Goblet of Fire!”

“Oh Ron,” said Hermione, shaking her head

sceptically, “we thought Snape was trying to kill

Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry’s

life, remember?”

She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room

and landed in the box they were all supposed to be

aiming at. Harry looked at Hermione, thinking ... it

was true that Snape had saved his life once, but the

 

odd thing was, Snape definitely loathed him, just as

he’d loathed Harry’s father when they had been at

school together. Snape loved taking points from

Harry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity

to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he

should be suspended from the school.

“I don’t care what Moody says,” Hermione went on.

“Dumbledore’s not stupid. He was right to trust

Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of

people wouldn’t have given them jobs, so why

shouldn’t he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a

bit — ”

“ — evil,” said Ron promptly. “Come on, Hermione,

why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his

office, then?”

“Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?” said

Hermione, ignoring Ron. “It’s a bit funny, isn’t it, that

he can’t manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can

get up here in the middle of the night when he wants

to?”

“You just don’t like Crouch because of that elf,

Winky,” said Ron, sending a cushion soaring into the

window.

“You just want to think Snape’s up to something,”

said Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly

into the box.

“I just want to know what Snape did with his first

chance, if he’s on his second one,” said Harry grimly,

and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew

straight across the room and landed neatly on top of

Hermione ’s.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Obedient to Sirius’s wish of hearing about anything

odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown

owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch

breaking into Snape’s office, and Moody and Snape’s

conversation. Then Harry turned his attention in

earnest to the most urgent problem facing him: how

to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-

fourth of February.

Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning

Charm again — Harry had explained about Aqua-

Lungs, and Ron couldn’t see why Harry shouldn’t

Summon one from the nearest Muggle town.

Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in

the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how

to operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an

hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the

International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it was too

much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-

Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.

“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to

Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something,”

Hermione said. “If only we’d done human

Transfiguration already! But I don’t think we start

that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you

don’t know what you’re doing. ...”

“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope

sticking out of my head,” said Harry. “I s’pose I could

always attack someone in front of Moody; he might do

it for me. ...”

“I don’t think he’d let you choose what you wanted to

be turned into, though,” said Hermione seriously.

“No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm.”

So Harry, thinking that he would soon have had

enough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried

 

himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking

for any spell that might enable a human to survive

without oxygen. However, though he, Ron, and

Hermione searched through their lunchtimes,

evenings, and whole weekends — though Harry asked

Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use

the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable,

vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help — they

found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to

spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.

Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb

Harry now, and he was finding it difficult to

concentrate in class again. The lake, which Harry had

always taken for granted as just another feature of

the grounds, drew his eyes whenever he was near a

classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly

water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to

seem as distant as the moon.

Just as it had before he faced the Horntail, time was

slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the

clocks to go extra-fast. There was a week to go before

February the twenty-fourth (there was still time) ...

there were five days to go (he was bound to find

something soon) ... three days to go (please let me find

something . . . please) . . .

With two days left, Harry started to go off food again.

The only good thing about breakfast on Monday was

the return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius. He

pulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the

shortest letter Sirius had ever written to him.

Send date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl.

Harry turned the parchment over and looked at the

back, hoping to see something else, but it was blank.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Weekend after next,” whispered Hermione, who had

read the note over Harry’s shoulder. “Here — take my

quill and send this owl back straight away.”

Harry scribbled the dates down on the back of

Sirius’s letter, tied it onto the brown owl’s leg, and

watched it take flight again. What had he expected?

Advice on how to survive underwater? He had been so

intent on telling Sirius all about Snape and Moody he

had completely forgotten to mention the egg’s clue.

“What’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade

weekend for?” said Ron.

“Dunno,” said Harry dully. The momentary happiness

that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had

died. “Come on ... Care of Magical Creatures.”

Whether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast-

Ended Skrewts, or because there were now only two

skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he

could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank

could, Harry didn’t know, but Hagrid had been

continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he’d

returned to work. It turned out that Hagrid knew

quite as much about unicorns as he did about

monsters, though it was clear that he found their lack

of poisonous fangs disappointing.

Today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals.

Unlike full-grown unicorns, they were pure gold.

Parvati and Lavender went into transports of delight

at the sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had

to work hard to conceal how much she liked them.

“Easier ter spot than the adults,” Hagrid told the

class. “They turn silver when they’re abou’ two years

old, an’ they grow horns at aroun’ four. Don’ go pure

white till they’re full grown, ’round about seven.

 

They’re a bit more trustin’ when they’re babies ... don’

mind boys so much. ... C’mon, move in a bit, yeh can

pat ’em if yeh want ... give ’em a few o’ these sugar

lumps. ...

“You okay, Harry?” Hagrid muttered, moving aside

slightly, while most of the others swarmed around the

baby unicorns.

“Yeah,” said Harry.

“Jus’ nervous, eh?” said Hagrid.

“Bit,” said Harry.

“Harry,” said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his

shoulder, so that Harry’s knees buckled under its

weight, “I’d’ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on

tha’ Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin’ yeh

set yer mind ter. I’m not worried at all. Yeh’re goin’ ter

be fine. Got yer clue worked out, haven’ yeh?”

Harry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge

to confess that he didn’t have any idea how to survive

at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him.

He looked up at Hagrid — perhaps he had to go into

the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it?

He looked after everything else on the grounds, after

all —

“Yeh’re goin’ ter win,” Hagrid growled, patting Harry’s

shoulder again, so that Harry actually felt himself

sink a couple of inches into the soft ground. “I know

it. I can feel it. Yeh’re goin’ ter win, Harry.”

Harry just couldn’t bring himself to wipe the happy,

confident smile off Hagrid ’s face. Pretending he was

interested in the young unicorns, he forced a smile in

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

return, and moved forward to pat them with the

others.

By the evening before the second task, Harry felt as

though he were trapped in a nightmare. He was fully

aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed to

find a suitable spell, he’d have a real job mastering it

overnight. How could he have let this happen? Why

hadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner? Why

had he ever let his mind wander in class — what if a

teacher had once mentioned how to breathe

underwater?

He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the

sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after

page of spells, hidden from one another by the

massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of

them. Harry’s heart gave a huge leap every time he

saw the word “water” on a page, but more often than

not it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a

pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt ...”

“I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly

from the other side of the table. “There’s nothing.

Nothing. Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and

ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere

near powerful enough to drain the lake.”

“There must be something,” Hermione muttered,

moving a candle closer to her. Her eyes were so tired

she was poring over the tiny print of Olde and

Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose

about an inch from the page. “They’d never have set a

task that was undoable.”

“They have,” said Ron. “Harry, just go down to the

lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the

merpeople to give back whatever they’ve nicked, and

see if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate.”

 

“There’s a way of doing it!” Hermione said crossly.

“There just has to be!”

She seemed to be taking the library’s lack of useful

information on the subject as a personal insult; it had

never failed her before.

“I know what I should have done,” said Harry, resting,

facedown, on Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts. “I

should’ve learned to be an Animagus like Sirius.”

An Animagus was a wizard who could transform into

an animal.

“Yeah, you could’ve turned into a goldfish any time

you wanted!” said Ron.

“Or a frog,” yawned Harry. He was exhausted.

“It takes years to become an Animagus, and then you

have to register yourself and everything,” said

Hermione vaguely, now squinting down the index of

Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their Solutions.

“Professor McGonagall told us, remember ... you’ve

got to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic

Office ... what animal you become, and your

markings, so you can’t abuse it. ...”

“Hermione, I was joking,” said Harry wearily. “I know I

haven’t got a chance of turning into a frog by

tomorrow morning. ...”

“Oh this is no use,” Hermione said, snapping shut

Weird Wizarding Dilemmas. “Who on earth wants to

make their nose hair grow into ringlets?”

“I wouldn’t mind,” said Fred Weasley’s voice. “Be a

talking point, wouldn’t it?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Fred and

George had just emerged from behind some

bookshelves.

“What’re you two doing here?” Ron asked.

“Looking for you,” said George. “McGonagall wants

you, Ron. And you, Hermione.”

“Why?” said Hermione, looking surprised.

“Dunno ... she was looking a bit grim, though,” said

Fred.

“We’re supposed to take you down to her office,” said

George.

Ron and Hermione stared at Harry, who felt his

stomach drop. Was Professor McGonagall about to tell

Ron and Hermione off? Perhaps she’d noticed how

much they were helping him, when he ought to be

working out how to do the task alone?

“Well meet you back in the common room,” Hermione

told Harry as she got up to go with Ron — both of

them looked very anxious. “Bring as many of these

books as you can, okay?”

“Right,” said Harry uneasily.

By eight o’clock, Madam Pince had extinguished all

the lamps and came to chivvy Harry out of the library.

Staggering under the weight of as many books as he

could carry, Harry returned to the Gryffindor common

room, pulled a table into a corner, and continued to

search. There was nothing in Madcap Magic for

Wacky Warlocks . . . nothing in A Guide to Medieval

Sorcery . . . not one mention of underwater exploits in

An Anthology of Eighteenth-Century Charms, or in

 

Dreadful Denizens of the Deep, or Powers You Never

Knew You Had and What to Do with Them Now You’ve

Wised Up.

Crookshanks crawled into Harry’s lap and curled up,

purring deeply. The common room emptied slowly

around Harry. People kept wishing him luck for the

next morning in cheery, confident voices like Hagrid’s,

all of them apparently convinced that he was about to

pull off another stunning performance like the one he

had managed in the first task. Harry couldn’t answer

them, he just nodded, feeling as though there were a

golfball stuck in his throat. By ten to midnight, he

was alone in the room with Crookshanks. He had

searched all the remaining books, and Ron and

Hermione had not come back.

It’s over, he told himself. You can’t do it. You’ll just

have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell

the judges. ...

He imagined himself explaining that he couldn’t do

the task. He pictured Bagman’s look of round-eyed

surprise, Karkaroff’s satisfied, yellow-toothed smile.

He could almost hear Fleur Delacour saying “I knew it

... ’e is too young, ’e is only a little boy.” He saw Malfoy

flashing his POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the

crowd, saw Hagrid’s crestfallen, disbelieving face. ...

Forgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap, Harry

stood up very suddenly; Crookshanks hissed angrily

as he landed on the floor, gave Harry a disgusted

look, and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the

air, but Harry was already hurrying up the spiral

staircase to his dormitory. . . . He would grab the

Invisibility Cloak and go back to the library, he’d stay

there all night if he had to. ...

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Lumos,” Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he

opened the library door.

Wand tip alight, he crept along the bookshelves,

pulling down more books — books of hexes and

charms, books on merpeople and water monsters,

books on famous witches and wizards, on magical

inventions, on anything at all that might include one

passing reference to underwater survival. He carried

them over to a table, then set to work, searching them

by the narrow beam of his wand, occasionally

checking his watch. ...

One in the morning . . . two in the morning . . . the only

way he could keep going was to tell himself, over and

over again, next book ...in the next one . . . the next one

The mermaid in the painting in the prefects’

bathroom was laughing. Harry was bobbing like a

cork in bubbly water next to her rock, while she held

his Firebolt over his head.

“Come and get it!” she giggled maliciously. “Come on,

jump!”

“I can’t,” Harry panted, snatching at the Firebolt, and

struggling not to sink. “Give it to me!”

But she just poked him painfully in the side with the

end of the broomstick, laughing at him.

“That hurts — get off — ouch — ”

“Harry Potter must wake up, sir!”

“Stop poking me — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Dobby must poke Harry Potter, sir, he must wake

up!”

Harry opened his eyes. He was still in the library; the

Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he’d

slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages

of Where There’s a Wand, There’s a Way. He sat up,

straightening his glasses, blinking in the bright

daylight.

“Harry Potter needs to hurry!” squeaked Dobby. “The

second task starts in ten minutes, and Harry Potter

“Ten minutes?” Harry croaked. “Ten — ten minutes?”

He looked down at his watch. Dobby was right. It was

twenty past nine. A large, dead weight seemed to fall

through Harry’s chest into his stomach.

“Hurry, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, plucking at

Harry’s sleeve. “You is supposed to be down by the

lake with the other champions, sir!”

“It’s too late, Dobby,” Harry said hopelessly. “I’m not

doing the task, I don’t know how — ”

“Harry Potter will do the task!” squeaked the elf.

“Dobby knew Harry had not found the right book, so

Dobby did it for him!”

“What?” said Harry. “But you don’t know what the

second task is — ”

“Dobby knows, sir! Harry Potter has to go into the

lake and find his Wheezy — ”

“Find my what?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“ — and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!”

“What’s a Wheezy?”

“Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy — Wheezy who is

giving Dobby his sweater!”

Dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he

was now wearing over his shorts.

“What?” Harry gasped. “They’ve got ... they’ve got

Ron?”

“The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked

Dobby. “ ‘But past an hour — ’ ”

“ — ‘the prospect’s black,’ ” Harry recited, staring,

horror-struck, at the elf. “ ‘Too late, it’s gone, it won’t

come back.’ Dobby — what’ve I got to do?”

“You has to eat this, sir!” squeaked the elf, and he put

his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a

ball of what looked like slimy, grayish-green rat tails.

“Right before you go into the lake, sir — gillyweed!”

“What’s it do?” said Harry, staring at the gillyweed.

“It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!”

“Dobby,” said Harry frantically, “listen — are you sure

about this?”

He couldn’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had

tried to “help” him, he had ended up with no bones in

his right arm.

“Dobby is quite sure, sir!” said the elf earnestly.

“Dobby hears things, sir, he is a house-elf, he goes all

over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the

 

floors. Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and

Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the

next task. . . . Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his

Wheezy!”

Harry’s doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he

pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag,

grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then

tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.

“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby

squealed as they burst into the corridor. “Dobby will

be missed — good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!”

“See you later, Dobby!” Harry shouted, and he

sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three

at a time.

The entrance hall contained a few last-minute

stragglers, all leaving the Great Hall after breakfast

and heading through the double oak doors to watch

the second task. They stared as Harry flashed past,

sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt

down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly

grounds.

As he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats

that had encircled the dragons’ enclosure in

November were now ranged along the opposite bank,

rising in stands that were packed to the bursting

point and reflected in the lake below. The excited

babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water

as Harry ran flat-out around the other side of the lake

toward the judges, who were sitting at another gold-

draped table at the water’s edge. Cedric, Fleur, and

Krum were beside the judges’ table, watching Harry

sprint toward them.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

‘Tm ... here ...” Harry panted, skidding to a halt in

the mud and accidentally splattering Fleur’s robes.

“Where have you been?” said a bossy, disapproving

voice. “The task’s about to start!”

Harry looked around. Percy Weasley was sitting at the

judges’ table — Mr. Crouch had failed to turn up

again.

“Now, now, Percy!” said Ludo Bagman, who was

looking intensely relieved to see Harry. “Let him catch

his breath!”

Dumbledore smiled at Harry, but Karkaroff and

Madame Maxime didn’t look at all pleased to see him.

... It was obvious from the looks on their faces that

they had thought he wasn’t going to turn up.

Harry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for

breath; he had a stitch in his side that felt as though

he had a knife between his ribs, but there was no

time to get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving

among the champions, spacing them along the bank

at intervals of ten feet. Harry was on the very end of

the line, next to Krum, who was wearing swimming

trunks and was holding his wand ready.

“All right, Harry?” Bagman whispered as he moved

Harry a few feet farther away from Krum. “Know what

you’re going to do?”

“Yeah,” Harry panted, massaging his ribs.

Bagman gave Harry’s shoulder a quick squeeze and

returned to the judges’ table; he pointed his wand at

his throat as he had done at the World Cup, said,

“Sonorusl” and his voice boomed out across the dark

water toward the stands.

 

“Well, all our champions are ready for the second

task, which will start on my whistle. They have

precisely an hour to recover what has been taken

from them. On the count of three, then. One ... two ...

three!”

The whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the

stands erupted with cheers and applause; without

looking to see what the other champions were doing,

Harry pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the

handful of gillyweed out of his pocket, stuffed it into

his mouth, and waded out into the lake.

It was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as

though this were fire, not icy water. His sodden robes

weighed him down as he walked in deeper; now the

water was over his knees, and his rapidly numbing

feet were slipping over silt and flat, slimy stones. He

was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he

could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like

octopus tentacles. Waist-deep in the freezing water he

stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to

happen.

He could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he

must look stupid, walking into the lake without

showing any sign of magical power. The part of him

that was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half

immersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze lifting his

hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided

looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming

louder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the

Slytherins. ...

Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an

invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and

nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head

spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a

piercing pain on either side of his neck —

 

Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt

two large slits just below his ears, flapping in the cold

air. ... He had gills. Without pausing to think, he did

the only thing that made sense — he flung himself

forward into the water.

The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of

life. His head had stopped spinning; he took another

great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through

his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He

stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at

them. They looked green and ghostly under the water,

and they had become webbed. He twisted around and

looked at his bare feet — they had become elongated

and the toes were webbed too: It looked as though he

had sprouted flippers.

The water didn’t feel icy anymore either ... on the

contrary, he felt pleasantly cool and very light. ...

Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and

fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the

water, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how

he no longer seemed to need to blink. He had soon

swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see

the bottom. He flipped over and dived into its depths.

Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a

strange, dark, foggy landscape. He could only see ten

feet around him, so that as he sped through the water

new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the

oncoming darkness: forests of rippling, tangled black

weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull,

glimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out

toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring

through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the

shadows beyond, where the water became opaque.

Small fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or

twice he thought he saw something larger moving

 

ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered

it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense

clump of weed. There was no sign of any of the other

champions, merpeople, Ron — nor, thankfully, the

giant squid.

Light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he

could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very

overgrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly

ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the

gloom . . . and then, without warning, something

grabbed hold of his ankle.

Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a

small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed,

its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry’s leg, its

pointed fangs bared — Harry stuck his webbed hand

quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand. By

the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had

risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry’s

robes, and were attempting to drag him down.

“Relashio\” Harry shouted, except that no sound came

out. ... A large bubble issued from his mouth, and his

wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows,

pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling

water, for where it struck them, angry red patches

appeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his ankle

out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he

could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water

over his shoulder at random; every now and then he

felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again,

and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot

connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw

the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while

its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back

into the weed.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back

inside his robes, and looked around, listening again.

He turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing

harder than ever against his eardrums. He knew he

must be even deeper in the lake now, but nothing was

moving but the rippling weed.

“How are you getting on?”

Harry thought he was having a heart attack. He

whipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating

hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her

thick, pearly glasses.

“Myrtle!” Harry tried to shout — but once again,

nothing came out of his mouth but a very large

bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled.

“You want to try over there!” she said, pointing. “I

won’t come with you. ... I don’t like them much, they

always chase me when I get too close. ...”

Harry gave her the thumbs-up to show his thanks

and set off once more, careful to swim a bit higher

over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that

might be lurking there.

He swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes.

He was passing over vast expanses of black mud now,

which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water.

Then, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting

mersong.

“An hour long you’ll have to look,

And to recover what we took ...”

Harry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge

out of the muddy water ahead. It had paintings of

 

merpeople on it; they were carrying spears and

chasing what looked like the giant squid. Harry swam

on past the rock, following the mersong.

"... your time’s half gone, so tarry not

Lest what you seek stays here to rot. ...”

A cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae

loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides. Here

and there at the dark windows, Harry saw faces ...

faces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting

of the mermaid in the prefects’ bathroom. ...

The merpeople had grayish skin and long, wild, dark

green hair. Their eyes were yellow, as were their

broken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles

around their necks. They leered at Harry as he swam

past; one or two of them emerged from their caves to

watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails

beating the water, spears clutched in their hands.

Harry sped on, staring around, and soon the

dwellings became more numerous; there were

gardens of weed around some of them, and he even

saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door.

Merpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching

him eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills,

talking behind their hands to one another. Harry sped

around a corner and a very strange sight met his

eyes.

A whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of

the houses that lined what looked like a mer-version

of a village square. A choir of merpeople was singing

in the middle, calling the champions toward them,

and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a

gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people

were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.

 

Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang.

There was also a girl who looked no older than eight,

whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that

she was Fleur Delacour’s sister. All four of them

appeared to be in a very deep sleep. Their heads were

lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of

bubbles kept issuing from their mouths.

Harry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the

merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him,

but they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the

hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very

strong. For a fleeting second he thought of the knife

Sirius had bought him for Christmas — locked in his

trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to

him whatsoever.

He looked around. Many of the merpeople

surrounding them were carrying spears. He swam

swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long

green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to

mime a request to borrow the spear. The merman

laughed and shook his head.

“We do not help,” he said in a harsh, croaky voice.

“Come ON\” Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles

issued from his mouth), and he tried to pull the spear

away from the merman, but the merman yanked it

back, still shaking his head and laughing.

Harry swirled around, staring about. Something

sharp ... anything ...

There were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived

and snatched up a particularly jagged one and

returned to the statue. He began to hack at the ropes

binding Ron, and after several minutes’ hard work,

they broke apart. Ron floated, unconscious, a few

 

inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the

ebb of the water.

Harry looked around. There was no sign of any of the

other champions. What were they playing at? Why

didn’t they hurry up? He turned back to Hermione,

raised the jagged rock, and began to hack at her

bindings too —

At once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized

him. Half a dozen mermen were pulling him away

from Hermione, shaking their green-haired heads,

and laughing.

“You take your own hostage,” one of them said to

him. “Leave the others ...”

“No way!” said Harry furiously — but only two large

bubbles came out.

“Your task is to retrieve your own friend . . . leave the

others ...”

“She’s my friend too!” Harry yelled, gesturing toward

Hermione, an enormous silver bubble emerging

soundlessly from his lips. “And I don’t want them to

die either!”

Cho’s head was on Hermione ’s shoulder; the small

silver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale. Harry

struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed

harder than ever, holding him back. Harry looked

wildly around. Where were the other champions?

Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and

come back down for Hermione and the others? Would

he be able to find them again? He looked down at his

watch to see how much time was left — it had

stopped working.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

But then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly

over his head. Harry looked up and saw Cedric

swimming toward them. There was an enormous

bubble around his head, which made his features

look oddly wide and stretched.

“Got lost!” he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. “Fleur

and Krum’re coming now!”

Feeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric

pull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free. He

pulled her upward and out of sight.

Harry looked around, waiting. Where were Fleur and

Krum? Time was getting short, and according to the

song, the hostages would be lost after an hour. . . .

The merpeople started screeching animatedly. Those

holding Harry loosened their grip, staring behind

them. Harry turned and saw something monstrous

cutting through the water toward them: a human

body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark. . . .

It was Krum. He appeared to have transfigured

himself — but badly.

The shark-man swam straight to Hermione and began

snapping and biting at her ropes; the trouble was that

Krum’s new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for

biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and Harry

was quite sure that if Krum wasn’t careful, he was

going to rip Hermione in half. Darting forward, Harry

hit Krum hard on the shoulder and held up the

jagged stone. Krum seized it and began to cut

Hermione free. Within seconds, he had done it; he

grabbed Hermione around the waist, and without a

backward glance, began to rise rapidly with her

toward the surface.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Now what? Harry thought desperately. If he could be

sure that Fleur was coming. ... But still no sign.

There was nothing to be done except . . .

He snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped,

but the mermen now closed in around Ron and the

little girl, shaking their heads at him. Harry pulled

out his wand.

“Get out of the way!”

Only bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the

distinct impression that the mermen had understood

him, because they suddenly stopped laughing. Their

yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry’s wand, and

they looked scared. There might be a lot more of them

than there were of him, but Harry could tell, by the

looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic

than the giant squid did.

“You’ve got until three!” Harry shouted; a great

stream of bubbles burst from him, but he held up

three fingers to make sure they got the message. “One

...” (he put down a finger) “two ...” (he put down a

second one) —

They scattered. Harry darted forward and began to

hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue,

and at last she was free. He seized the little girl

around the waist, grabbed the neck of Ron’s robes,

and kicked off from the bottom.

It was very slow work. He could no longer use his

webbed hands to propel himself forward; he worked

his flippers furiously, but Ron and Fleur’s sister were

like potato-filled sacks dragging him back down. ...

He fixed his eyes skyward, though he knew he must

still be very deep, the water above him was so dark.

 

Merpeople were rising with him. He could see them

swirling around him with ease, watching him struggle

through the water. ... Would they pull him back down

to the depths when the time was up? Did they

perhaps eat humans? Harry’s legs were seizing up

with the effort to keep swimming; his shoulders were

aching horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and

the girl. ...

He was drawing breath with extreme difficulty. He

could feel pain on the sides of his neck again ... he

was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in

his mouth . . . yet the darkness was definitely thinning

now ... he could see daylight above him. ...

He kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that

they were nothing more than feet . . . water was

flooding through his mouth into his lungs ... he was

starting to feel dizzy, but he knew light and air were

only ten feet above him ... he had to get there ... he

had to . . .

Harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as

though his muscles were screaming in protest; his

very brain felt waterlogged, he couldn’t breathe, he

needed oxygen, he had to keep going, he could not

stop —

And then he felt his head break the surface of the

lake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making his wet

face sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he

had never breathed properly before, and, panting,

pulled Ron and the little girl up with him. All around

him, wild, green-haired heads were emerging out of

the water with him, but they were smiling at him.

The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of

noise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be

on their feet; Harry had the impression they thought

 

that Ron and the little girl might be dead, but they

were wrong ... both of them had opened their eyes;

the girl looked scared and confused, but Ron merely

expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright

light, turned to Harry, and said, “Wet, this, isn’t it?”

Then he spotted Fleur’s sister. “What did you bring

her for?”

“Fleur didn’t turn up, I couldn’t leave her,” Harry

panted.

“Harry, you prat,” said Ron, “you didn’t take that song

thing seriously, did you? Dumbledore wouldn’t have

let any of us drown!”

“The song said — ”

“It was only to make sure you got back inside the time

limit!” said Ron. “I hope you didn’t waste time down

there acting the hero!”

Harry felt both stupid and annoyed. It was all very

well for Ron; he’d been asleep, he hadn’t felt how

eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear-

carrying merpeople who’d looked more than capable

of murder.

“C’mon,” Harry said shortly, “help me with her, I don’t

think she can swim very well.”

They pulled Fleur’s sister through the water, back

toward the bank where the judges stood watching,

twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of

honor, singing their horrible screechy songs.

Harry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over

Hermione, Krum, Cedric, and Cho, all of whom were

wrapped in thick blankets. Dumbledore and Ludo

Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the

 

bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked

very white and somehow much younger than usual,

came splashing out to meet them. Meanwhile

Madame Maxime was trying to restrain Fleur

Delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and

nail to return to the water.

“Gabrielle! Gabrielle\ Is she alive ? Is she ’urt?”

“She’s fine!” Harry tried to tell her, but he was so

exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout.

Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the

bank (“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); Dumbledore and

Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken

free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.

“It was ze grindylows . . . zey attacked me ... oh

Gabrielle, I thought ... I thought ...”

“Come here, you,” said Madam Pomfrey. She seized

Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the

others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he

felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a

measure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam

gushed out of his ears.

“Harry, well done!” Hermione cried. “You did it, you

found out how all by yourself!”

“Well — ” said Harry. He would have told her about

Dobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching

him. He was the only judge who had not left the table;

the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and

relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur’s sister had got back

safely. “Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, raising his

voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-

ninny,” said Krum. Harry had the impression that

Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself;

perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her

from the lake, but Hermione brushed away the beetle

impatiently and said, “You’re well outside the time

limit, though, Harry. . . . Did it take you ages to find

us?”

“No ... I found you okay. ...”

Harry’s feeling of stupidity was growing. Now he was

out of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that

Dumbledore’s safety precautions wouldn’t have

permitted the death of a hostage just because their

champion hadn’t turned up. Why hadn’t he just

grabbed Ron and gone? He would have been first

back. ... Cedric and Krum hadn’t wasted time

worrying about anyone else; they hadn’t taken the

mersong seriously. ...

Dumbledore was crouching at the water’s edge, deep

in conversation with what seemed to be the chief

merperson, a particularly wild and ferocious-looking

female. He was making the same sort of screechy

noises that the merpeople made when they were

above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak

Mermish. Finally he straightened up, turned to his

fellow judges, and said, “A conference before we give

the marks, I think.”

The judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had

gone to rescue Ron from Percy’s clutches; she led him

over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and

some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and

her sister. Fleur had many cuts on her face and arms

and her robes were torn, but she didn’t seem to care,

nor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Look after Gabrielle,” she told her, and then she

turned to Harry. “You saved ’er,” she said

breathlessly. “Even though she was not your ’ostage.”

“Yeah,” said Harry, who was now heartily wishing

he’d left all three girls tied to the statue.

Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek

(he felt his face burn and wouldn’t have been

surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again),

then said to Ron, “And you too — you ’elped — ”

“Yeah,” said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, “yeah, a

bit — ”

Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him.

Hermione looked simply furious, but just then, Ludo

Bagman’s magically magnified voice boomed out

beside them, making them all jump, and causing the

crowd in the stands to go very quiet.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision.

Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what

happened at the bottom of the lake, and we have

therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each

of the champions, as follows. ...

“Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent

use of the Bubble-Head Charm, was attacked by

grindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to

retrieve her hostage. We award her twenty-five

points.”

Applause from the stands.

“I deserved zero,” said Fleur throatily, shaking her

magnificent head.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head

Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though

he returned one minute outside the time limit of an

hour.” Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the

crowd; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look. “We

therefore award him forty-seven points.”

Harry’s heart sank. If Cedric had been outside the

time limit, he most certainly had been.

“Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of

Transfiguration, which was nevertheless effective, and

was second to return with his hostage. We award him

forty points.”

Karkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very

superior.

“Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect,” Bagman

continued. “He returned last, and well outside the

time limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess

informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the

hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to

his determination to return all hostages to safety, not

merely his own.”

Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half-exasperated,

half-commiserating looks.

“Most of the judges,” and here, Bagman gave

Karkaroff a very nasty look, “feel that this shows

moral fiber and merits full marks. However ... Mr.

Potter’s score is forty-five points.”

Harry’s stomach leapt — he was now tying for first

place with Cedric. Ron and Hermione, caught by

surprise, stared at Harry, then laughed and started

applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“There you go, Harry!” Ron shouted over the noise.

“You weren’t being thick after all — you were showing

moral fiber!”

Fleur was clapping very hard too, but Krum didn’t

look happy at all. He attempted to engage Hermione

in conversation again, but she was too busy cheering

Harry to listen.

“The third and final task will take place at dusk on

the twenty-fourth of June,” continued Bagman. “The

champions will be notified of what is coming precisely

one month beforehand. Thank you all for your

support of the champions.”

It was over, Harry thought dazedly, as Madam

Pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages

back to the castle to get into dry clothes ... it was

over, he had got through ... he didn’t have to worry

about anything now until June the twenty-fourth. ...

Next time he was in Hogsmeade, Harry decided as he

walked back up the stone steps into the castle, he

was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day

of the year.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

PADFOOT RETURNS

One of the best things about the aftermath of the

second task was that everybody was very keen to hear

details of what had happened down in the lake, which

meant that Ron was getting to share Harry’s limelight

for once. Harry noticed that Ron’s version of events

changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave

what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with

Hermione’s story, anyway — Dumbledore had put all

the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor

McGonagall’s office, first assuring them that they

would be quite safe, and would awake when they were

back above the water. One week later, however, Ron

was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he

struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed

merpeople who had to beat him into submission

before tying him up.

“But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,” he assured

Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron

now that he was getting so much attention and was

making a point of talking to him every time they

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

passed in the corridors. “I could’ve taken those mer-

idiots any time I wanted.”

“What were you going to do, snore at them?” said

Hermione waspishly. People had been teasing her so

much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would

most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.

Ron’s ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the

bewitched sleep version of events.

As they entered March the weather became drier, but

cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time

they went out onto the grounds. There were delays in

the post because the owls kept being blown off

course. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius

with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up

at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers

sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn

off Sirius’s reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it

was going to be sent outside again.

Sirius’s letter was almost as short as the previous

one.

Be at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past

Dervish and Banges) at two o’clock on Saturday

afternoon. Bring as much food as you can.

“He hasn’t come back to Hogsmeade?” said Ron

incredulously.

“It looks like it, doesn’t it?” said Hermione.

“I can’t believe him,” said Harry tensely, “if he’s

caught ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Made it so far, though, hasn’t he?” said Ron. “And

it’s not like the place is swarming with dementors

anymore.”

Harry folded up the letter, thinking. If he was honest

with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He

therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon

— double Potions — feeling considerably more

cheerful than he usually did when descending the

steps to the dungeons.

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle

outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson’s

gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at

something Harry couldn’t see and sniggering heartily.

Pansy’s pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle ’s

broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.

“There they are, there they are!” she giggled, and the

knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy

had a magazine in her hands — Witch Weekly. The

moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired

witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large

sponge cake with her wand.

“You might find something to interest you in there,

Granger!” Pansy said loudly, and she threw the

magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking

startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened,

and Snape beckoned them all inside.

Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the

back of the dungeon as usual. Once Snape had

turned his back on them to write up the ingredients

of today’s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily

rifled through the magazine under the desk. At last,

in the center pages, Hermione found what they were

looking for. Harry and Ron leaned in closer. A color

photograph of Harry headed a short piece entitled:

 

Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache

A boy like no other, perhaps — yet a boy suffering all

the usual pangs of adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter.

Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents,

fourteen-year-old Harry Potter thought he had found

solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle-

born Hermione Granger. Little did he know that he

would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow

in a life already littered with personal loss.

Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to

have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone

cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor

Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World

Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with

both boys’ affections. Krum, who is openly smitten

with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited

her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays,

and insists that he has “never felt this way about any

other girl.”

However, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful

natural charms that have captured these unfortunate

boys’ interest.

“She’s really ugly,” says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty

and vivacious fourth-year student, “but she’d be well

up to making a Love Potion, she’s quite brainy. I

think that’s how she’s doing it.”

Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and

no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate

these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potter’s well-

wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his

heart on a worthier candidate.

“I told you!” Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared

down at the article. “I told you not to annoy Rita

 

Skeeter! She’s made you out to be some sort of — of

scarlet woman!”

Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted

with laughter. “ Scarlet woman?” she repeated,

shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked

around at Ron.

“It’s what my mum calls them,” Ron muttered, his

ears going red.

“If that’s the best Rita can do, she’s losing her touch,”

said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch

Weekly onto the empty chair beside her. “What a pile

of old rubbish.”

She looked over at the Slytherins, who were all

watching her and Harry closely across the room to see

if they had been upset by the article. Hermione gave

them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry,

and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they

would need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion.

“There’s something funny, though,” said Hermione

ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over

a bowl of scarab beetles. “How could Rita Skeeter

have known ... ?”

“Known what?” said Ron quickly. “You haven’t been

mixing up Love Potions, have you?”

“Don’t be stupid,” Hermione snapped, starting to

pound up her beetles again. “No, it’s just ... how did

she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the

summer?”

Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and

determinedly avoided Ron’s eyes.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“What?” said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud

clunk.

“He asked me right after he’d pulled me out of the

lake,” Hermione muttered. “After he’d got rid of his

shark’s head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets

and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges

so they wouldn’t hear, and he said, if I wasn’t doing

anything over the summer, would I like to — ”

“And what did you say?” said Ron, who had picked up

his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six

inches from his bowl, because he was looking at

Hermione.

“And he did say he’d never felt the same way about

anyone else,” Hermione went on, going so red now

that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from

her, “but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him?

She wasn’t there ... or was she? Maybe she has got an

Invisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the

grounds to watch the second task. ...”

“And what did you say?” Ron repeated, pounding his

pestle down so hard that it dented the desk.

“Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry

were okay to — ”

“Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is,

Miss Granger,” said an icy voice right behind them,

and all three of them jumped, “I must ask you not to

discuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor.”

Snape had glided over to their desk while they were

talking. The whole class was now looking around at

them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER

STINKS across the dungeon at Harry.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?”

Snape added, snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly.

“A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of

course ...” Snape’s black eyes glittered as they fell on

Rita Skeeter’s article. “Potter has to keep up with his

press cuttings. ...”

The dungeon rang with the Slytherins’ laughter, and

an unpleasant smile curled Snape’s thin mouth. To

Harry’s fury, he began to read the article aloud.

“ ‘Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache . . . dear, dear,

Potter, what’s ailing you now? ‘A boy like no other,

perhaps ...’ ”

Harry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing

at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a

hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse

when read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing

scarlet now.

“ ‘. . . Harry Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next

time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.’

How very touching,” sneered Snape, rolling up the

magazine to continued gales of laughter from the

Slytherins. “Well, I think I had better separate the

three of you, so you can keep your minds on your

potions rather than on your tangled love lives.

Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there,

beside Miss Parkinson. Potter — that table in front of

my desk. Move. Now.”

Furious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into

his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the

dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down

at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron.

Determined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the

mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to

have Snape’s face.

 

“All this press attention seems to have inflated your

already over-large head, Potter,” said Snape quietly,

once the rest of the class had settled down again.

Harry didn’t answer. He knew Snape was trying to

provoke him; he had done this before. No doubt he

was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points

from Gryffindor before the end of the class.

“You might be laboring under the delusion that the

entire wizarding world is impressed with you,” Snape

went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him

(Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even

though he had already reduced them to a very fine

powder), “but I don’t care how many times your

picture appears in the papers. To me, Potter, you are

nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to

be beneath him.”

Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron

and started cutting up his ginger roots. His hands

were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his

eyes down, as though he couldn’t hear what Snape

was saying to him.

“So I give you fair warning, Potter,” Snape continued

in a softer and more dangerous voice, “pint-sized

celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my

office one more time — ”

“I haven’t been anywhere near your office!” said Harry

angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness.

“Don’t lie to me,” Snape hissed, his fathomless black

eyes boring into Harry’s. “Boomslang skin. Gillyweed.

Both come from my private stores, and I know who

stole them.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink

or to look guilty. In truth, he hadn’t stolen either of

these things from Snape. Hermione had taken the

boomslang skin back in their second year — they had

needed it for the Polyjuice Potion — and while Snape

had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been

able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the

gillyweed.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry lied

coldly.

“You were out of bed on the night my office was

broken into!” Snape hissed. “I know it, Potter! Now,

Mad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but

I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime

stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay!”

“Right,” said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger

roots. “I’ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go

in there.”

Snape’s eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the

inside of his black robes. For one wild moment, Harry

thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and

curse him — then he saw that Snape had drawn out a

small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry

stared at it.

“Do you know what this is, Potter?” Snape said, his

eyes glittering dangerously again.

“No,” said Harry, with complete honesty this time.

“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that

three drops would have you spilling your innermost

secrets for this entire class to hear,” said Snape

viciously. “Now, the use of this potion is controlled by

very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch

 

your step, you might just find that my hand slips” —

he shook the crystal bottle slightly — “right over your

evening pumpkin juice. And then, Potter ... then we’ll

find out whether you’ve been in my office or not.”

Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger

roots once more, picked up his knife, and started

slicing them again. He didn’t like the sound of that

Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to

slip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought

of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape

did it . . . quite apart from landing a whole lot of people

in trouble — Hermione and Dobby for a start — there

were all the other things he was concealing . . . like the

fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . and — his

insides squirmed at the thought — how he felt about

Cho. ... He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron

too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out

of Moody’s book and start drinking only from a

private hip flask.

There was a knock on the dungeon door.

“Enter,” said Snape in his usual voice.

The class looked around as the door opened.

Professor Karkaroff came in. Everyone watched him

as he walked up toward Snape ’s desk. He was

twisting his finger around his goatee and looking

agitated.

“We need to talk,” said Karkaroff abruptly when he

had reached Snape. He seemed so determined that

nobody should hear what he was saying that he was

barely opening his lips; it was as though he were a

rather poor ventriloquist. Harry kept his eyes on his

ginger roots, listening hard.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I’ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,” Snape

muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him.

“I want to talk now, while you can’t slip off, Severus.

You’ve been avoiding me.”

“After the lesson,” Snape snapped.

Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to

see if he’d poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry

sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them.

Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked

angry.

Karkaroff hovered behind Snape ’s desk for the rest of

the double period. He seemed intent on preventing

Snape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen to

hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately

knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two

minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse

to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while

the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door.

“What’s so urgent?” he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff.

“This,” said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the

edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left-

hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on

his inner forearm.

“Well?” said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to

move his lips. “Do you see? It’s never been this clear,

never since — ”

“Put it away!” snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping

the classroom.

“But you must have noticed — ” Karkaroff began in an

agitated voice.

 

“We can talk later, Karkaroff!” spat Snape. “Potter!

What are you doing?”

“Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,” said Harry

innocently, straightening up and showing Snape the

sodden rag he was holding.

Karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the

dungeon. He looked both worried and angry. Not

wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry

Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back

into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and

Hermione what he had just witnessed.

They left the castle at noon the next day to find a

weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds. The

weather was milder than it had been all year, and by

the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them

had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their

shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was

in Harry’s bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken

legs, a loaf of bread, and a flask of pumpkin juice

from the lunch table.

They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present

for Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most

lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned

with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that

screamed loudly when they became too smelly. Then,

at half past one, they made their way up the High

Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the

edge of the village.

Harry had never been in this direction before. The

winding lane was leading them out into the wild

countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were

fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were

walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose

shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner

 

and saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for

them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very

large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some

newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . .

“Hello, Sirius,” said Harry when they had reached

him.

The black dog sniffed Harry’s bag eagerly, wagged its

tail once, then turned and began to trot away from

them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to

meet the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron, and

Hermione climbed over the stile and followed.

Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain,

where the ground was covered with boulders and

rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but

Harry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath.

They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain

itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep,

winding, and stony path, following Sirius’s wagging

tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of

Harry’s bag cutting into his shoulders.

Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when

they reached the place where he had vanished, they

saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into

it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave.

Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a

large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray

horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak’s fierce orange eye

flashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed

low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a

moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and

allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his

feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the

black dog, which had just turned into his godfather.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Sirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones

he had been wearing when he had left Azkaban. His

black hair was longer than it had been when he had

appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted

once more. He looked very thin.

“Chicken!” he said hoarsely after removing the old

Daily Prophets from his mouth and throwing them

down onto the cave floor.

Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the

bundle of chicken legs and bread.

“Thanks,” said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a

drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing

off a large chunk with his teeth. “I’ve been living off

rats mostly. Can’t steal too much food from

Hogsmeade; I’d draw attention to myself.”

He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin

only reluctantly.

“What’re you doing here, Sirius?” he said.

“Fulfilling my duty as godfather,” said Sirius, gnawing

on the chicken bone in a very doglike way. “Don’t

worry about it, I’m pretending to be a lovable stray.”

He was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in

Harry’s face, said more seriously, “I want to be on the

spot. Your last letter ... well, let’s just say things are

getting fishier. I’ve been stealing the paper every time

someone throws one out, and by the looks of things,

I’m not the only one who’s getting worried.”

He nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave

floor, and Ron picked them up and unfolded them.

Harry, however, continued to stare at Sirius.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“What if they catch you? What if you’re seen?”

“You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around

here who know I’m an Animagus,” said Sirius,

shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg.

Ron nudged Harry and passed him the Daily

Prophets. There were two: The first bore the headline

Mystery Illness of Bartemius Crouch, the second,

Ministry Witch Still Missing — Minister of Magic Now

Personally Involved.

Harry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases

jumped out at him: hasn’t been seen in public since

November ... house appears deserted ... St. Mungo’s

Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline

comment . . . Ministry refuses to confirm rumors of

critical illness. . . .

“They’re making it sound like he’s dying,” said Harry

slowly. “But he can’t be that ill if he managed to get

up here. ...”

“My brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant,” Ron

informed Sirius. “He says Crouch is suffering from

overwork.”

“Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up

close,” said Harry slowly, still reading the story. “The

night my name came out of the goblet. ...”

“Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn’t

he?” said Hermione, an edge to her voice. She was

stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius’s

chicken bones. “I bet he wishes he hadn’t done it now

— bet he feels the difference now she’s not there to

look after him.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Hermione’s obsessed with house-elfs,” Ron muttered

to Sirius, casting Hermione a dark look. Sirius,

however, looked interested.

“Crouch sacked his house-elf?”

“Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,” said Harry, and

he launched into the story of the Dark Mark’s

appearance, and Winky being found with Harry’s

wand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch’s fury.

When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet again

and had started pacing up and down the cave.

“Let me get this straight,” he said after a while,

brandishing a fresh chicken leg. “You first saw the elf

in the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?”

“Right,” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.

“But Crouch didn’t turn up for the match?”

“No,” said Harry. “I think he said he’d been too busy.”

Sirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he

said, “Harry, did you check your pockets for your

wand after you’d left the Top Box?”

“Erm ...” Harry thought hard. “No,” he said finally. “I

didn’t need to use it before we got in the forest. And

then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in

there were my Omnioculars.” He stared at Sirius. “Are

you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand

in the Top Box?”

“It’s possible,” said Sirius.

“Winky didn’t steal that wand!” Hermione insisted.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“The elf wasn’t the only one in that box,” said Sirius,

his brow furrowed as he continued to pace. “Who else

was sitting behind you?”

“Loads of people,” said Harry. “Some Bulgarian

ministers ... Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ...”

“The Malfoys!” said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his

voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak

tossed his head nervously. “I bet it was Lucius

Malfoy!”

“Anyone else?” said Sirius.

“No one,” said Harry.

“Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,” Hermione

reminded him.

“Oh yeah ...”

“I don’t know anything about Bagman except that he

used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,” said

Sirius, still pacing. “What’s he like?”

“He’s okay,” said Harry. “He keeps offering to help me

with the Triwizard Tournament.”

“Does he, now?” said Sirius, frowning more deeply. “I

wonder why he’d do that?”

“Says he’s taken a liking to me,” said Harry.

“Hmm,” said Sirius, looking thoughtful.

“We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark

appeared,” Hermione told Sirius. “Remember?” she

said to Harry and Ron.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Yeah, but he didn’t stay in the forest, did he?” said

Ron. “The moment we told him about the riot, he

went off to the campsite.”

“How d’you know?” Hermione shot back. “How d’you

know where he Disapparated to?”

“Come off it,” said Ron incredulously. “Are you saying

you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?”

“It’s more likely he did it than Winky,” said Hermione

stubbornly.

“Told you,” said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius,

“told you she’s obsessed with house — ”

But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron.

“When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf

had been discovered holding Harry’s wand, what did

Crouch do?”

“Went to look in the bushes,” said Harry, “but there

wasn’t anyone else there.”

“Of course,” Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, “of

course, he’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf

. . . and then he sacked her?”

“Yes,” said Hermione in a heated voice, “he sacked

her, just because she hadn’t stayed in her tent and let

herself get trampled — ”

“Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!” said

Ron.

Sirius shook his head and said, “She’s got the

measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at

how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”

He ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently

thinking hard.

“All these absences of Barty Crouch’s ... he goes to

the trouble of making sure his house-elf saves him a

seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn’t bother

to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate

the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to

that too. ... It’s not like Crouch. If he’s ever taken a

day off work because of illness before this, I’ll eat

Buckbeak.”

“D’you know Crouch, then?” said Harry.

Sirius’s face darkened. He suddenly looked as

menacing as he had the night when Harry first met

him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a

murderer.

“Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was

the one who gave the order for me to be sent to

Azkaban — without a trial.”

“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.

“You’re kidding!” said Harry.

“No, I’m not,” said Sirius, taking another great bite of

chicken. “Crouch used to be Head of the Department

of Magical Law Enforcement, didn’t you know?”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads.

“He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,” said

Sirius. “He’s a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully

magical — and power-hungry. Oh never a Voldemort

 

supporter,” he said, reading the look on Harry’s face.

“No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against

the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were

against the Dark Side ... well, you wouldn’t

understand ... you’re too young. ...”

“That’s what my dad said at the World Cup,” said

Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice. “Try us,

why don’t you?”

A grin flashed across Sirius’s thin face.

“All right, I’ll try you. ...” He walked once up the cave,

back again, and then said, “Imagine that Voldemort’s

powerful now. You don’t know who his supporters

are, you don’t know who’s working for him and who

isn’t; you know he can control people so that they do

terrible things without being able to stop themselves.

You’re scared for yourself, and your family, and your

friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths,

more disappearances, more torturing ... the Ministry

of Magic’s in disarray, they don’t know what to do,

they’re trying to keep everything hidden from the

Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too.

Terror everywhere ... panic ... confusion ... that’s how

it used to be.

“Well, times like that bring out the best in some

people and the worst in others. Crouch’s principles

might’ve been good in the beginning — I wouldn’t

know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he

started ordering very harsh measures against

Voldemort’s supporters. The Aurors were given new

powers — powers to kill rather than capture, for

instance. And I wasn’t the only one who was handed

straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought

violence with violence, and authorized the use of the

Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he

became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark

 

Side. He had his supporters, mind you — plenty of

people thought he was going about things the right

way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards

clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic.

When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a

matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then

something rather unfortunate happened. ...” Sirius

smiled grimly. “Crouch’s own son was caught with a

group of Death Eaters who’d managed to talk their

way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to

find Voldemort and return him to power.”

“Crouch’s son was caught?” gasped Hermione.

“Yep,” said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to

Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground

beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. “Nasty

little shock for old Barty, I’d imagine. Should have

spent a bit more time at home with his family,

shouldn’t he? Ought to have left the office early once

in a while ... gotten to know his own son.”

He began to wolf down large pieces of bread.

“ Was his son a Death Eater?” said Harry.

“No idea,” said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. “I was

in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is

mostly stuff I’ve found out since I got out. The boy

was definitely caught in the company of people I’d bet

my life were Death Eaters — but he might have been

in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the

house-elf.”

“Did Crouch try and get his son off?” Hermione

whispered.

Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a

bark.

 

“Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the

measure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened

to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated

his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw

him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she

associated him with the Dark Mark again — doesn’t

that tell you what he’s like? Crouch’s fatherly

affection stretched just far enough to give his son a

trial, and by all accounts, it wasn’t much more than

an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the

boy ... then he sent him straight to Azkaban.”

“He gave his own son to the dementors?” asked Harry

quietly.

“That’s right,” said Sirius, and he didn’t look remotely

amused now. “I saw the dementors bringing him in,

watched them through the bars in my cell door. He

can’t have been more than nineteen. They took him

into a cell near mine. He was screaming for his

mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days,

though . . . they all went quiet in the end . . . except

when they shrieked in their sleep. ...”

For a moment, the deadened look in Sirius’s eyes

became more pronounced than ever, as though

shutters had closed behind them.

“So he’s still in Azkaban?” Harry said.

“No,” said Sirius dully. “No, he’s not in there anymore.

He died about a year after they brought him in.”

“He died?”

“He wasn’t the only one,” said Sirius bitterly. “Most go

mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They

lose the will to live. You could always tell when a

death was coming, because the dementors could

 

sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty

sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important

Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a

deathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty

Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died

herself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted

away just like the boy. Crouch never came for his

son’s body. The dementors buried him outside the

fortress; I watched them do it.”

Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his

mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin

juice and drained it.

“So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he

had it made,” he continued, wiping his mouth with

the back of his hand. “One moment, a hero, poised to

become Minister of Magic . . . next, his son dead, his

wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I’ve

heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once

the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more

sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a

nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly

astray. The conclusion was that his father never

cared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top

job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the

Department of International Magical Cooperation.”

There was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the

way Crouch’s eyes had bulged as he’d looked down at

his disobedient house-elf back in the wood at the

Quidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been

why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found

beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back

memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall

from grace at the Ministry.

“Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark

wizards,” Harry told Sirius.

 

“Yeah, I’ve heard it’s become a bit of a mania with

him,” said Sirius, nodding. “If you ask me, he still

thinks he can bring back the old popularity by

catching one more Death Eater.”

“And he sneaked up here to search Snape’s office!”

said Ron triumphantly, looking at Hermione.

“Yes, and that doesn’t make sense at all,” said Sirius.

“Yeah, it does!” said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook

his head.

“Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why

hasn’t he been coming to judge the tournament? It

would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to

Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.”

“So you think Snape could be up to something, then?”

asked Harry, but Hermione broke in.

“Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts

Snape — ”

“Oh give it a rest, Hermione,” said Ron impatiently. “I

know Dumbledore ’s brilliant and everything, but that

doesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn’t fool

him — ”

“Why did Snape save Harry’s life in the first year,

then? Why didn’t he just let him die?”

“I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would

kick him out — ”

“What d’you think, Sirius?” Harry said loudly, and

Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I think they’ve both got a point,” said Sirius, looking

thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. “Ever since I

found out Snape was teaching here, I’ve wondered

why Dumbledore hired him. Snape ’s always been

fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at

school. Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was,” Sirius

added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other.

“Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school

than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of

a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be

Death Eaters.”

Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off

names.

“Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors

the year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges —

they’re a married couple — they’re in Azkaban. Avery

— from what I’ve heard he wormed his way out of

trouble by saying he’d been acting under the Imperius

Curse — he’s still at large. But as far as I know,

Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater

— not that that means much. Plenty of them were

never caught. And Snape ’s certainly clever and

cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.”

“Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to

keep that quiet,” said Ron.

“Yeah, you should’ve seen Snape’s face when

Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!” said Harry

quickly. “Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says

Snape’s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really

worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but

I couldn’t see what it was.”

“He showed Snape something on his arm?” said

Sirius, looking frankly bewildered. He ran his fingers

distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged

 

again. “Well, I’ve no idea what that’s about ... but if

Karkaroff’s genuinely worried, and he’s going to

Snape for answers ...”

Sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of

frustration.

“There’s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape,

and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other

people wouldn’t, but I just can’t see him letting Snape

teach at Hogwarts if he’d ever worked for Voldemort.”

“Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into

Snape ’s office then?” said Ron stubbornly.

“Well,” said Sirius slowly, “I wouldn’t put it past Mad-

Eye to have searched every single teacher’s office

when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense

Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I’m not sure

he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he’s seen,

it’s not surprising. I’ll say this for Moody, though, he

never killed if he could help it. Always brought people

in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never

descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch,

though ... he’s a different matter ... is he really ill? If

he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to

Snape ’s office? And if he’s not ... what’s he up to?

What was he doing at the World Cup that was so

important he didn’t turn up in the Top Box? What’s

he been doing while he should have been judging the

tournament?”

Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave

wall. Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky

floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked.

Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You say your brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant?

Any chance you could ask him if he’s seen Crouch

lately?”

“I can try,” said Ron doubtfully. “Better not make it

sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy,

though. Percy loves Crouch.”

“And you might try and find out whether they’ve got

any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you’re at it,” said

Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily

Prophet.

“Bagman told me they hadn’t,” said Harry.

“Yes, he’s quoted in the article in there,” said Sirius,

nodding at the paper. “Blustering on about how bad

Bertha’s memory is. Well, maybe she’s changed since

I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn’t forgetful at

all — quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she

had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her

into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her

mouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at

the Ministry of Magic ... maybe that’s why Bagman

didn’t bother to look for her for so long. ...”

Sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his

shadowed eyes.

“What’s the time?”

Harry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn’t

been working since it had spent over an hour in the

lake.

“It’s half past three,” said Hermione.

“You’d better get back to school,” Sirius said, getting

to his feet. “Now listen ...” He looked particularly hard

 

at Harry. “I don’t want you lot sneaking out of school

to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still

want to hear about anything odd. But you’re not to go

leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an

ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.”

“No one’s tried to attack me so far, except a dragon

and a couple of grindylows,” Harry said, but Sirius

scowled at him.

“I don’t care ... I’ll breathe freely again when this

tournament’s over, and that’s not until June. And

don’t forget, if you’re talking about me among

yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?”

He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and

went to pat Buckbeak good-bye. “I’ll walk to the edge

of the village with you,” said Sirius, “see if I can

scrounge another paper.”

He transformed into the great black dog before they

left the cave, and they walked back down the

mountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn

ground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of

them to pat him on the head, before turning and

setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into

Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts.

“Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?”

Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle.

“But maybe he doesn’t care ... it’d probably just make

him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves

rules. He’d just say Crouch was refusing to break

them for his own son.”

“Percy would never throw any of his family to the

dementors,” said Hermione severely.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I don’t know,” said Ron. “If he thought we were

standing in the way of his career . . . Percy’s really

ambitious, you know. ...”

They walked up the stone steps into the entrance

hall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted

toward them from the Great Hall.

“Poor old Snuffles,” said Ron, breathing deeply. “He

must really like you, Harry. ... Imagine having to live

off rats.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE MADNESS OF MR. CROUCH

Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery

after breakfast on Sunday to send a letter to Percy,

asking, as Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen

Mr. Crouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had

been so long since she’d had a job. When they had

watched her fly out of sight through the Owlery

window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give

Dobby his new socks.

The house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome,

bowing and curtsying and bustling around making

tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present.

“Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!” he squeaked,

wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes.

“You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you

really did,” said Harry.

“No chance of more of those eclairs, is there?” said

Ron, who was looking around at the beaming and

bowing house-elves.

 

“You’ve just had breakfast!” said Hermione irritably,

but a great silver platter of eclairs was already

zooming toward them, supported by four elves.

“We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,”

Harry muttered.

“Good idea,” said Ron. “Give Pig something to do. You

couldn’t give us a bit of extra food, could you?” he

said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed

delightedly and hurried off to get some more.

“Dobby, where’s Winky?” said Hermione, who was

looking around.

“Winky is over there by the fire, miss,” said Dobby

quietly, his ears drooping slightly.

“Oh dear,” said Hermione as she spotted Winky.

Harry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was

sitting on the same stool as last time, but she had

allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not

immediately distinguishable from the smoke-

blackened brick behind her. Her clothes were ragged

and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of

butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring

into the fire. As they watched her, she gave an

enormous hiccup.

“Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,”

Dobby whispered to Harry.

“Well, it’s not strong, that stuff,” Harry said.

But Dobby shook his head. “ Tis strong for a house-

elf, sir,” he said.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Winky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the

eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned

to work.

“Winky is pining, Harry Potter,” Dobby whispered

sadly. “Winky wants to go home. Winky still thinks

Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby

says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is

her master now.”

“Hey, Winky,” said Harry, struck by a sudden

inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down,

“you don’t know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do

you? Because he’s stopped turning up to judge the

Triwizard Tournament.”

Winky’s eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused

on Harry. She swayed slightly again and then said, “M

— Master is stopped — hie — coming?”

“Yeah,” said Harry, “we haven’t seen him since the

first task. The Daily Prophet’s saying he’s ill.”

Winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.

“Master — hie — ill?”

Her bottom lip began to tremble.

“But we’re not sure if that’s true,” said Hermione

quickly.

“Master is needing his — hie — Winky!” whimpered

the elf. “Master cannot — hie — manage — hie — all

by himself. ...”

“Other people manage to do their own housework,

you know, Winky,” Hermione said severely.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Winky — hie — is not only — hie — doing housework

for Mr. Crouch!” Winky squeaked indignantly,

swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer

down her already heavily stained blouse. “Master is —

hie — trusting Winky with — hie — the most

important — hie — the most secret — ”

“What?” said Harry.

But Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more

butterbeer down herself.

“Winky keeps — hie — her master’s secrets,” she said

mutinously, swaying very heavily now, frowning up at

Harry with her eyes crossed. “You is — hie — nosing,

you is.”

“Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!” said

Dobby angrily. “Harry Potter is brave and noble and

Harry Potter is not nosy!”

“He is nosing — hie — into my master’s — hie —

private and secret — hie — Winky is a good house-elf

— hie — Winky keeps her silence — hie — people

trying to — hie — pry and poke — hie — ”

Winky’s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without

warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring

loudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away

across the stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen house-

elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted. One

of them picked up the bottle; the others covered

Winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the

ends in neatly, hiding her from view.

“We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!”

squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking

very ashamed. “We is hoping you will not judge us all

by Winky, sirs and miss!”

 

“She’s unhappy!” said Hermione, exasperated. “Why

don’t you try and cheer her up instead of covering her

up?”

“Begging your pardon, miss,” said the house-elf,

bowing deeply again, “but house-elves has no right to

be unhappy when there is work to be done and

masters to be served.”

“Oh for heaven’s sake!” Hermione cried. “Listen to me,

all of you! You’ve got just as much right as wizards to

be unhappy! You’ve got the right to wages and

holidays and proper clothes, you don’t have to do

everything you’re told — look at Dobby!”

“Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,” Dobby

mumbled, looking scared. The cheery smiles had

vanished from the faces of the house-elves around the

kitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as

though she were mad and dangerous.

“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at Harry’s

elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and

some fruit into Harry’s arms. “Good-bye!”

The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and

Hermione and began shunting them out of the

kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of

their backs.

“Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!” Dobby called

miserably from the hearth, where he was standing

next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky.

“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you,

Hermione?” said Ron angrily as the kitchen door

slammed shut behind them. “They won’t want us

visiting them now! We could’ve tried to get more stuff

out of Winky about Crouch!”

 

“Oh as if you care about that!” scoffed Hermione. “You

only like coming down here for the food!”

It was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so

tired of Ron and Hermione sniping at each other over

their homework in the common room that he took

Sirius’s food up to the Owlery that evening on his

own.

Pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire

ham up to the mountain by himself, so Harry enlisted

the help of two school screech owls as well. When

they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd

carrying the large package between them, Harry

leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds,

at the dark, rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest,

and the rippling sails of the Durmstrang ship. An

eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from

Hagrid’s chimney; it soared toward the castle, around

the Owlery, and out of sight. Looking down, Harry

saw Hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin.

Harry wondered what he was doing; it looked as

though he were making a new vegetable patch. As he

watched, Madame Maxime emerged from the

Beauxbatons carriage and walked over to Hagrid. She

appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation.

Hagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen

to prolong their talk, because Madame Maxime

returned to the carriage shortly afterward.

Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to

Ron and Hermione snarling at each other, Harry

watched Hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed

him and the owls around Harry began to awake,

swooshing past him into the night.

By breakfast the next day Ron’s and Hermione’s bad

moods had burnt out, and to Harry’s relief, Ron’s

dark predictions that the house-elves would send

 

substandard food up to the Gryffindor table because

Hermione had insulted them proved false; the bacon,

eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.

When the post owls arrived, Hermione looked up

eagerly; she seemed to be expecting something.

“Percy won’t’ve had time to answer yet,” said Ron. “We

only sent Hedwig yesterday.”

“No, it’s not that,” said Hermione. “I’ve taken out a

subscription to the Daily Prophet I’m getting sick of

finding everything out from the Slytherins.”

“Good thinking!” said Harry, also looking up at the

owls. “Hey, Hermione, I think you’re in luck — ”

A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.

“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking

disappointed. “It’s — ”

But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front

of her plate, closely followed by four barn owls, a

brown owl, and a tawny.

“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said

Harry, seizing Hermione ’s goblet before it was

knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were

jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter

first.

“What on earth — ?” Hermione said, taking the letter

from the gray owl, opening it, and starting to read.

“Oh really!” she sputtered, going rather red.

“What’s up?” said Ron.

“It’s — oh how ridiculous — ”

 

She thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was

not handwritten, but composed from pasted letters

that seemed to have been cut out of the Daily Prophet.

You are a WickEd giRL. HarRy PotTER desErves

BeTteR. GO back wherE you cAMe from mUGgle.

“They’re all like it!” said Hermione desperately,

opening one letter after another. “ ‘Harry Potter can do

much better than the likes of you. ...’ ‘You deserve to

be boiled in frog spawn. ...’ Ouch!”

She had opened the last envelope, and yellowish-

green liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over

her hands, which began to erupt in large yellow boils.

“Undiluted bubotuber pus!” said Ron, picking up the

envelope gingerly and sniffing it.

“Ow!” said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she

tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin, but

her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful

sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair

of thick, knobbly gloves.

“You’d better get up to the hospital wing,” said Harry

as the owls around Hermione took flight. “We’ll tell

Professor Sprout where you’ve gone. ...”

“I warned her!” said Ron as Hermione hurried out of

the Great Hall, cradling her hands. “I warned her not

to annoy Rita Skeeter! Look at this one ...” He read

out one of the letters Hermione had left behind: “ ‘I

read in Witch Weekly about how you are playing

Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough

hardship and I will be sending you a curse by next

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.’

Blimey, she’d better watch out for herself.”

Hermione didn’t turn up for Herbology. As Harry and

Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical

Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle

descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy

Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them

with her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of

Harry, Pansy called, “Potter, have you split up with

your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?”

Harry ignored her; he didn’t want to give her the

satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch

Weekly article had caused.

Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had

finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside

his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his

feet. Harry’s heart sank at the sight of the crates —

surely not another skrewt hatching? — but when he

got near enough to see inside, he found himself

looking at a number of fluffy black creatures with

long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like

spades, and they were blinking up at the class,

looking politely puzzled at all the attention.

“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had

gathered around. “Yeh find ’em down mines mostly.

They like sparkly stuff. ... There yeh go, look.”

One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and

attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson’s watch off her

wrist. She shrieked and jumped backward.

“Useful little treasure detectors,” said Hagrid happily.

“Thought we’d have some fun with ’em today. See over

there?” He pointed at the large patch of freshly turned

earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery

 

window. “I’ve buried some gold coins. I’ve got a prize

fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most. Jus’

take off all yer valuables, an’ choose a niffler, an’ get

ready ter set ’em loose.”

Harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing

out of habit, as it didn’t work anymore, and stuffed it

into his pocket. Then he picked up a niffler. It put its

long snout in Harry’s ear and sniffed enthusiastically.

It was really quite cuddly.

“Hang on,” said Hagrid, looking down into the crate,

“there’s a spare niffler here ... who’s missin’? Where’s

Hermione?”

“She had to go to the hospital wing,” said Ron.

“Well explain later,” Harry muttered; Pansy

Parkinson was listening.

It was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care

of Magical Creatures. The nifflers dived in and out of

the patch of earth as though it were water, each

scurrying back to the student who had released it and

spitting gold into their hands. Ron’s was particularly

efficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins.

“Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?” he asked

excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil,

splattering his robes.

“Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, Ron,” said Hagrid,

grinning. “They wreck houses, nifflers. I reckon

they’ve nearly got the lot, now,” he added, pacing

around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued

to dive. “I on’y buried a hundred coins. Oh there

y’are, Hermione!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Hermione was walking toward them across the lawn.

Her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked

miserable. Pansy Parkinson was watching her

beadily.

“Well, let’s check how yeh’ve done!” said Hagrid.

“Count yer coins! An’ there’s no point tryin’ ter steal

any, Goyle,” he added, his beetle-black eyes

narrowed. “It’s leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a few

hours.”

Goyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky. It

turned out that Ron’s niffler had been most

successful, so Hagrid gave him an enormous slab of

Honeydukes chocolate for a prize. The bell rang

across the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set

off back to the castle, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione

stayed behind to help Hagrid put the nifflers back in

their boxes. Harry noticed Madame Maxime watching

them out of her carriage window.

“What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?” said

Hagrid, looking concerned.

Hermione told him about the hate mail she had

received that morning, and the envelope full of

bubotuber pus.

“Aaah, don’ worry,” said Hagrid gently, looking down

at her. “I got some o’ those letters an’ all, after Rita

Skeeter wrote abou’ me mum. ‘Yeh’re a monster an’

yeh should be put down.’ ‘Yer mother killed innocent

people an’ if you had any decency you’d jump in a

lake. ’ ”

“No!” said Hermione, looking shocked.

“Yeah,” said Hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by

his cabin wall. “They’re jus’ nutters, Hermione. Don’

 

open ’em if yeh get any more. Chuck ’em straigh’ in

the fire.”

“You missed a really good lesson,” Harry told

Hermione as they headed back toward the castle.

“They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they, Ron?”

Ron, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid

had given him. He looked thoroughly put out about

something.

“What’s the matter?” said Harry. “Wrong flavor?”

“No,” said Ron shortly. “Why didn’t you tell me about

the gold?”

“What gold?” said Harry.

“The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,”

said Ron. “The leprechaun gold I gave you for my

Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn’t you tell me

it disappeared?”

Harry had to think for a moment before he realized

what Ron was talking about.

“Oh ...” he said, the memory coming back to him at

last. “I dunno ... I never noticed it had gone. I was

more worried about my wand, wasn’t I?”

They climbed the steps into the entrance hall and

went into the Great Hall for lunch.

“Must be nice,” Ron said abruptly, when they had sat

down and started serving themselves roast beef and

Yorkshire puddings. “To have so much money you

don’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!” said

Harry impatiently. “We all did, remember?”

“I didn’t know leprechaun gold vanishes,” Ron

muttered. “I thought I was paying you back. You

shouldn’t ’ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat for

Christmas.”

“Forget it, all right?” said Harry.

Ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork,

glaring at it. Then he said, “I hate being poor.”

Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Neither of

them really knew what to say.

“It’s rubbish,” said Ron, still glaring down at his

potato. “I don’t blame Fred and George for trying to

make some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a

niffler.”

“Well, we know what to get you next Christmas,” said

Hermione brightly. Then, when Ron continued to look

gloomy, she said, “Come on, Ron, it could be worse.

At least your fingers aren’t full of pus.” Hermione was

having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork,

her fingers were so stiff and swollen. “I hate that

Skeeter woman!” she burst out savagely. “I’ll get her

back for this if it’s the last thing I do!”

Hate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the

following week, and although she followed Hagrid’s

advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill-

wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the

Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the

whole Hall to hear. Even those people who didn’t read

Witch Weekly knew all about the supposed Harry-

 

Krum-Hermione triangle now. Harry was getting sick

of telling people that Hermione wasn’t his girlfriend.

“It’ll die down, though,” he told Hermione, “if we just

ignore it. ... People got bored with that stuff she wrote

about me last time — ”

“I want to know how she’s listening into private

conversations when she’s supposed to be banned

from the grounds!” said Hermione angrily.

Hermione hung back in their next Defense Against

the Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody

something. The rest of the class was very eager to

leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of

hex-deflection that many of them were nursing small

injuries. Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears,

he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he

walked away from the class.

“Well, Rita’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!”

Hermione panted five minutes later, catching up with

Harry and Ron in the entrance hall and pulling

Harry’s hand away from one of his wiggling ears so

that he could hear her. “Moody says he didn’t see her

anywhere near the judges’ table at the second task, or

anywhere near the lake!”

“Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop

this?” said Ron.

“No!” said Hermione stubbornly. “I want to know how

she heard me talking to Viktor! And how she found

out about Hagrid’s mum!”

“Maybe she had you bugged,” said Harry.

“Bugged?” said Ron blankly. “What ... put fleas on her

or something?”

 

Harry started explaining about hidden microphones

and recording equipment. Ron was fascinated, but

Hermione interrupted them.

“Aren’t you two ever going to read Hogwarts, A

History?”

“What’s the point?” said Ron. “You know it by heart,

we can just ask you.”

“All those substitutes for magic Muggles use —

electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things

— they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there’s too

much magic in the air. No, Rita’s using magic to

eavesdrop, she must be. ... If I could just find out

what it is ... ooh, if it’s illegal, I’ll have her ...”

“Haven’t we got enough to worry about?” Ron asked

her. “Do we have to start a vendetta against Rita

Skeeter as well?”

“I’m not asking you to help!” Hermione snapped. “I’ll

do it on my own!”

She marched back up the marble staircase without a

backward glance. Harry was quite sure she was going

to the library.

“What’s the betting she comes back with a box of /

Hate Rita Skeeter badges?” said Ron.

Hermione, however, did not ask Harry and Ron to

help her pursue vengeance against Rita Skeeter, for

which they were both grateful, because their workload

was mounting ever higher in the days before the

Easter holidays. Harry frankly marveled at the fact

that Hermione could research magical methods of

eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to

do. He was working flat-out just to get through all

 

their homework, though he made a point of sending

regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain

for Sirius; after last summer, Harry had not forgotten

what it felt like to be continually hungry. He enclosed

notes to Sirius, telling him that nothing out of the

ordinary had happened, and that they were still

waiting for an answer from Percy.

Hedwig didn’t return until the end of the Easter

holidays. Percy’s letter was enclosed in a package of

Easter eggs that Mrs. Weasley had sent. Both Harry’s

and Ron’s were the size of dragon eggs and full of

homemade toffee. Hermione’s, however, was smaller

than a chicken egg. Her face fell when she saw it.

“Your mum doesn’t read Witch Weekly, by any

chance, does she, Ron?” she asked quietly.

“Yeah,” said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee.

“Gets it for the recipes.”

Hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg.

“Don’t you want to see what Percy’s written?” Harry

asked her hastily.

Percy’s letter was short and irritated.

As I am constantly telling the Daily Prophet, Mr.

Crouch is taking a well-deserved break. He is sending

in regular owls with instructions. No, I haven’t actually

seen him, but I think I can be trusted to know my own

superior’s handwriting. I have quite enough to do at

the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous

rumors. Please don’t bother me again unless it’s

something important. Happy Easter.

The start of the summer term would normally have

meant that Harry was training hard for the last

 

Quidditch match of the season. This year, however, it

was the third and final task in the Triwizard

Tournament for which he needed to prepare, but he

still didn’t know what he would have to do. Finally, in

the last week of May, Professor McGonagall held him

back in Transfiguration.

“You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at

nine o’clock, Potter,” she told him. “Mr. Bagman will

be there to tell the champions about the third task.”

So at half past eight that night, Harry left Ron and

Hermione in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs.

As he crossed the entrance hall, Cedric came up from

the Hufflepuff common room.

“What d’you reckon it’s going to be?” he asked Harry

as they went together down the stone steps, out into

the cloudy night. “Fleur keeps going on about

underground tunnels; she reckons we’ve got to find

treasure.”

“That wouldn’t be too bad,” said Harry, thinking that

he would simply ask Hagrid for a niffler to do the job

for him.

They walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch

stadium, turned through a gap in the stands, and

walked out onto the field.

“What’ve they done to it?” Cedric said indignantly,

stopping dead.

The Quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat. It

looked as though somebody had been building long,

low walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in

every direction.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“They’re hedges!” said Harry, bending to examine the

nearest one.

“Hello there!” called a cheery voice.

Ludo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field

with Krum and Fleur. Harry and Cedric made their

way toward them, climbing over the hedges. Fleur

beamed at Harry as he came nearer. Her attitude

toward him had changed completely since he had

saved her sister from the lake.

“Well, what d’you think?” said Bagman happily as

Harry and Cedric climbed over the last hedge.

“Growing nicely, aren’t they? Give them a month and

Hagrid’ll have them twenty feet high. Don’t worry,” he

added, grinning, spotting the less-than-happy

expressions on Harry’s and Cedric’s faces, “you’ll have

your Quidditch field back to normal once the task is

over! Now, I imagine you can guess what we’re

making here?”

No one spoke for a moment. Then —

“Maze,” grunted Krum.

“That’s right!” said Bagman. “A maze. The third task’s

really very straightforward. The Triwizard Cup will be

placed in the center of the maze. The first champion

to touch it will receive full marks.”

“We seemply ’ave to get through the maze?” said

Fleur.

“There will be obstacles,” said Bagman happily,

bouncing on the balls of his feet. “Hagrid is providing

a number of creatures . . . then there will be spells that

must be broken ... all that sort of thing, you know.

Now, the champions who are leading on points will

 

get a head start into the maze.” Bagman grinned at

Harry and Cedric. “Then Mr. Krum will enter ... then

Miss Delacour. But you 11 all be in with a fighting

chance, depending how well you get past the

obstacles. Should be fun, eh?”

Harry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures

that Hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this,

thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all. However,

he nodded politely like the other champions.

“Very well ... if you haven’t got any questions, we’ll go

back up to the castle, shall we, it’s a bit chilly. ...”

Bagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to

wend their way out of the growing maze. Harry had

the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to

help him again, but just then, Krum tapped Harry on

the shoulder.

“Could I haff a vord?”

“Yeah, all right,” said Harry, slightly surprised.

“Vill you valk vith me?”

“Okay,” said Harry curiously.

Bagman looked slightly perturbed.

“I’ll wait for you, Harry, shall I?”

“No, it’s okay, Mr. Bagman,” said Harry, suppressing

a smile, “I think I can find the castle on my own,

thanks.”

Harry and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum

did not set a course for the Durmstrang ship. Instead,

he walked toward the forest.

 

“What ’re we going this way for?” said Harry as they

passed Hagrid’s cabin and the illuminated

Beauxbatons carriage.

“Don’t vant to be overheard,” said Krum shortly.

When at last they had reached a quiet stretch of

ground a short way from the Beauxbatons horses’

paddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and

turned to face Harry.

“I vant to know,” he said, glowering, “vot there is

between you and Hermy-own-ninny.”

Harry, who from Krum’s secretive manner had

expected something much more serious than this,

stared up at Krum in amazement.

“Nothing,” he said. But Krum glowered at him, and

Harry, somehow struck anew by how tall Krum was,

elaborated. “We’re friends. She’s not my girlfriend and

she never has been. It’s just that Skeeter woman

making things up.”

“Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often,” said

Krum, looking suspiciously at Harry.

“Yeah,” said Harry, “because we’re friends.”

He couldn’t quite believe he was having this

conversation with Viktor Krum, the famous

International Quidditch player. It was as though the

eighteen-year-old Krum thought he, Harry, was an

equal — a real rival —

“You haff never ... you haff not ...”

“No,” said Harry very firmly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Krum looked slightly happier. He stared at Harry for a

few seconds, then said, “You fly very veil. I vos

votching at the first task.”

“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly

feeling much taller himself. “I saw you at the

Quidditch World Cup. The Wronski Feint, you really

But something moved behind Krum in the trees, and

Harry, who had some experience of the sort of thing

that lurked in the forest, instinctively grabbed Krum’s

arm and pulled him around.

“Vot is it?”

Harry shook his head, staring at the place where he’d

seen movement. He slipped his hand inside his robes,

reaching for his wand.

Suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak.

For a moment, Harry didn’t recognize him ... then he

realized it was Mr. Crouch.

He looked as though he had been traveling for days.

The knees of his robes were ripped and bloody, his

face scratched; he was unshaven and gray with

exhaustion. His neat hair and mustache were both in

need of a wash and a trim. His strange appearance,

however, was nothing to the way he was behaving.

Muttering and gesticulating, Mr. Crouch appeared to

be talking to someone that he alone could see. He

reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen

once when out shopping with the Dursleys. That man

too had been conversing wildly with thin air; Aunt

Petunia had seized Dudley’s hand and pulled him

across the road to avoid him; Uncle Vernon had then

treated the family to a long rant about what he would

like to do with beggars and vagrants.

 

“Vosn’t he a judge?” said Krum, staring at Mr.

Crouch. “Isn’t he vith your Ministry?”

Harry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked

slowly toward Mr. Crouch, who did not look at him,

but continued to talk to a nearby tree.

"... and when you’ve done that, Weatherby, send an

owl to Dumbledore confirming the number of

Durmstrang students who will be attending the

tournament, Karkaroff has just sent word there will

be twelve. ...”

“Mr. Crouch?” said Harry cautiously.

"... and then send another owl to Madame Maxime,

because she might want to up the number of

students she’s bringing, now Karkaroff’s made it a

round dozen ... do that, Weatherby, will you? Will

you? Will...”

Mr. Crouch’s eyes were bulging. He stood staring at

the tree, muttering soundlessly at it. Then he

staggered sideways and fell to his knees.

“Mr. Crouch?” Harry said loudly. “Are you all right?”

Crouch’s eyes were rolling in his head. Harry looked

around at Krum, who had followed him into the trees,

and was looking down at Crouch in alarm.

“Vot is wrong with him?”

“No idea,” Harry muttered. “Listen, you’d better go

and get someone — ”

“Dumbledore!” gasped Mr. Crouch. He reached out

and seized a handful of Harry’s robes, dragging him

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

closer, though his eyes were staring over Harry’s

head. “I need ... see ... Dumbledore. ...”

“Okay,” said Harry, “if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can

go up to the — ”

“I’ve done ... stupid ... thing ...” Mr. Crouch breathed.

He looked utterly mad. His eyes were rolling and

bulging, and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his

chin. Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a

terrible effort. “Must ... tell ... Dumbledore ...”

“Get up, Mr. Crouch,” said Harry loudly and clearly.

“Get up, I’ll take you to Dumbledore!”

Mr. Crouch’s eyes rolled forward onto Harry.

“Who ... you?” he whispered.

“I’m a student at the school,” said Harry, looking

around at Krum for some help, but Krum was

hanging back, looking extremely nervous.

“You’re not ... his?” whispered Crouch, his mouth

sagging.

“No,” said Harry, without the faintest idea what

Crouch was talking about.

“Dumbledore ’s?”

“That’s right,” said Harry.

Crouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen

Crouch’s grip on his robes, but it was too powerful.

“Warn ... Dumbledore ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I’ll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,” said Harry.

“Just let go, Mr. Crouch, and I’ll get him. ...”

“Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done

that, I would like a cup of tea. My wife and son will be

arriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight

with Mr. and Mrs. Fudge.”

Crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and

seemed completely unaware that Harry was there,

which surprised Harry so much he didn’t notice that

Crouch had released him.
